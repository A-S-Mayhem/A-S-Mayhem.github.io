I'm an active member of the Grads Advising Graduate Admissions (GAGA) group in the MIT Department of Physics, whose role is to provide the grad student perspective and advice on the admissions process. As part of GAGA, I help run the Physics Graduate Application Assistance (PhysGAAP) program, which aims to provide additional information and help to prospective applications to the MIT Physics PhD program. This program consists of yearly webinars, held in the fall and the recordings posted to [our website](https://physics.mit.edu/academic-programs/graduate-students/graduate-admissions/#guidance), and a 1-on-1 mentorship program for students to get individualized help on their application. The motivation behind this program was to reduce the barriers for application to the MIT Physics PhD program and address the underrepresentation of students from historically excluded communities. You can read more about this initiative on [the MIT Physics website](https://physics.mit.edu/academic-programs/graduate-students/graduate-admissions/#guidance) or in [this Astrobite](https://astrobites.org/2023/11/04/mit-physgaap-2023/).
