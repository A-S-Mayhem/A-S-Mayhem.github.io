I'm a member of the organizing committee for Boston's chapter of Astronomy on Tap, which features events at local bars, breweries, and coffee shops where astronomy experts give public talks, followed by space-themed trivia. I've helped host events since our chapter started up again in 2022. Check out [our event listings](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/boston-ma/) or keep an eye on [our social media](https://www.facebook.com/aotboston/) if you're interested in joining for one of our events!
