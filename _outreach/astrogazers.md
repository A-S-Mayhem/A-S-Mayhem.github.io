I'm a member of the MIT Sidewalk Astrogazers organization and am currently co-leading the organization in 2023. Our group has 5 telescopes, include 3 dobsonians, 1 solar (H$\alpha$), and 1 [Unistellar eVscope](https://www.unistellar.com/evscope2/) that we bring to the sidewalks of Cambridge and Boston to show the public! We also partner with local organizations, like the MIT Museum, to host specific events with stargazing. Check out [our website](http://astrogazers.mit.edu/) for more details!
