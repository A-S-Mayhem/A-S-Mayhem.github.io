I'm a graduate student writer for [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/), a collaboration of graduate students that takes scientific articles and condenses them down into bite-size pieces that the public can understand (our target audience being undergraduates). I've been writing for Astrobites since January 2023 and am also an active member of the Climate Change and Divsersity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committees. You can find my Astrobite articles [here](https://astrobites.org/author/mmasterson/)!
