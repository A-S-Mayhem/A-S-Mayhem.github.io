To change the pellet air a bit I will start processing a new data set.

Arriving to the Lab
======

I think the loneliness is getting to me, or maybe members of other labs are trying to drive me crazy.

As I arrived at the AMTC building I felt them staring at me.

The Samples
======

The new samples look like a grey powder, I need to check the information sent by our technology partner (Secret Agent 002, SA002) 

Again, there are two versions available, a version that looks like fine sand and a more powdered version. Again there is very little material XD

Tools
------

A lot of dust has been kicked up in the lab and I need to clean up the work environment a bit.

I need to upgrade my respirators to take care of my lungs and clean the conveyor belt to avoid problems with the moving structure.

Off topic

Analogy XD
------

I want to go see my nieces, a lot of work these weeks and a lot of isolation due to the pandemic.

In the meantime I will load cement cylinders for their hyperspectral characterization.

A child crashed an automobile into a train in the south of my country! Impressive.
Apparently his relatives were in the vehicle with him, and they were drunk.

Need of relax
------

I need relaxation activities or to go and share with nature.

I miss the science outreach activities, like when we created a science graffiti.

It's getting a little late, but at least the night is beautiful.
