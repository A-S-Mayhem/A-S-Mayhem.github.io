Resting day attempting a Delivery Ramen!.

The Ramen
======

There is a place where before the pandemic we went for a good plate of ramen. quite nice and themed.
![Ramen Kintaro](https://www.kintaro.cl/)


Due to the pandemic, these types of places, like most restaurants, remain closed for face-to-face care.

However, many have made an effort to carry out delivery tasks.

But, how to deliver ramen?
Everything would be messy.

However, in Kintaro they found the way, they send the noodles, the toppings (egg, meat, etc) and the soup separately !!!!

Then one must carefully place the toppings on the noodles and apply the soup to regain the experience of a freshly prepared ramen !!!

The Limonade
======

Due to the pandemic, many of the products in our building are obtained by buying and selling between neighbors.

To make the afternoons more cheerful, some neighbors hold contests.

Today a lemonade was raffled off to the first man to paint his nails !!!

So it was thought and done !!!
