We began hyperspectral acquisition of clay samples using the available VNIR and SWIR cameras.

The material is a fine powder, so be careful not to raise dust in the environment. Sanitary measures are stricter than normal due to the pandemic. In addition, for the acquisition process it is not good to introduce contamination to the environment.

The samples have assorted colors. That is where my knowledge of samples goes!

We must organize a meeting with the expert geologist of our team so that she supports us by analyzing the samples in more detail.
