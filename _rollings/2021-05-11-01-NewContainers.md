Looking for new containers for some samples.

The issue
======

Among the current collaborations with industrial partners we have received for the first time a high level of individual sample size.

Usually the samples sent for laboratory characterization are small portions of material prepared for specific assays. Therefore they always tend to correspond to small quantities from tens to hundreds of grams.

On this occasion we have received samples of cements. Each sample is one kilogram of material, which is orders of magnitude more material than we are used to characterizing.

Normally you would homogenize the material and extract representative samples from it.

However, our goal is to be able to characterize the spectral variability of the samples, so if we have a lot of material it is best to image as much of the material as possible. 

Our sensors are 2D images (actually scanline frames on a conveyor belt).

So one option is to use the current containers and keep depositing and changing the material.
But it is a bit time consuming to take so many images.

So I'm looking for bigger containers where I can arrange the material on a larger surface, so in fewer shots I can better characterize the material.

Although it is difficult to send to build custom containers given the country situation. So I am looking for a temporary alternative. 
Some relatively large container XD
