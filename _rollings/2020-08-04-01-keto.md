In an attempt to improve our health, we and Gloria have been trying to cut down on carbohydrates for several months.

Low carb nutrition
======

At a general level we are reducing the consumption of sugars and flour dough. The idea is to maintain a balanced diet with healthy fats (avocado) and proteins.

We have discovered several very interesting and tasty foods.

Palmitos

Lasagna and palm heart noodles are really a good flour noodle replacement
