A new evaluation of our systems for classification and prediction in real time of process variables from hyperspectral images begins.

In this opportunity, we will have a pilot stage where we will evaluate clay and arid materials.

For clays, the aim is to predict the content of mineral compounds of interest previously characterized by XRD. There is also a sub-database with information on inflation by water absorption.

In the case of arids, samples of gravel, fine gravel, coarse sand, fine sand, and integral material are available. These samples are accompanied by characterization of the granulometric profile (histograms of grain size) and estimation of the content of sultaphs and chlorites.
