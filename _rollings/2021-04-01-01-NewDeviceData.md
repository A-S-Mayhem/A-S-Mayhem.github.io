We are exploring potential collaborations with the pyrometallurgical laboratory of our university.
 

Preliminary data and device

The preliminary idea considers the analysis of raw data generated for a portable X ray analyser.

Pyro Lab staff provided us with raw data generated by the software associated with the devices. We will evaluate these new kind of data.
