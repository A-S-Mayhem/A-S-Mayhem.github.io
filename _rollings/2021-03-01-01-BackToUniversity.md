Despite not having a vacation this year, it's time to go back to school!

Samples have arrived from some industries, mining companies and potential technology partners, so a couple of months of hyperspectral image acquisition and data characterization are coming up.

The national background
======

In Chile, emphasis has been placed on the Covid vaccine process. It is expected that in the next few months high levels of vaccination will be reached, which could allow reactivating the economy and some economic and social activities.

In our case, we hope that the investment and research areas of various national industries on which the financing of our applied scientific laboratory depends will be reactivated.

Memories
======

Among the memories that Google Photos periodically reminds us of was an outing with my wife a few years ago in Providencia.

On that occasion we met a street artist who made a very personal and captivating miniature work!

Truly a unique experience, hopefully one day we can live something like that again!

In my leisure time in social networks in social networks in social networks I found a new reaction to facebook, XD 

An emoticon reflecting the little shark of entrepreneurship that we all carry inside.
