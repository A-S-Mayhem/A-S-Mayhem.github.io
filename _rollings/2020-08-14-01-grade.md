Finally, the electrical engineering doctorate process is closed.

Scientific publications are accepted, the defense was carried out correctly, and despite the pandemic the bureaucracy has advanced and the documents are available.

The end

It has been a busy and complex time, but this stage closes appropriately. They have been interesting topics that I have been able to investigate and some results seem quite entertaining.

It has required more interaction with humans than I would have preferred, but it seems that is the way it all works.

I have to Teach a subject related with medical informatics and image processing at the Universidad San Sebastian. It is required to adapt all content to work in a online mode.
