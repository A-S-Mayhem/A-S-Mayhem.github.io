Just a normal day.

The Interaction
======

I'm being incorporated to a FONDEF project so I need to support some tasks related with new topics.


The Topic
------

A coworker (Coworker 013 -  Cw013) show us some data related with the project. The data is processed with ANDES (a geological and geostatistical software developed by ALGES)

The problem is related with the definition of the pits for the process of explotation of a open mine

As a open mine is blasted in a sorted processs, the definition of the pits both in shape and size are relevant for the mining operation.

Several pits and its interaction must be optimized in the definition of the final pit (the superposition of all the schedulled pits)

The ore grade could be considered in the process

With the definition of the shape of the final pit, then the sequence of extraction is required

It is not clear at this moment what I'm doing here XD. I need to study the process...


Come back to the samples
======

Returning to the normal work. I need to crop samples to isolated spectral data for the samples of a project.
I dont remember the project. I need to sleep.
