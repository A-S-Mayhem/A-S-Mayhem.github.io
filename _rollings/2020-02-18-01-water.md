During this month the university is in recess. Students do not come and only minimal essential staff, and I who do not take vacations XD, we stay here.

It's been a lonely few weeks in college, nothing could be better.

My water device
------

To prepare for work this summer, I purchased a small water dispenser so I don't have to go to the central water dispensers.

Air conditioning failing
------

Always in summer it tends to fail, the worst thing is that as it is the university rest period, the repair process by the faculty staff is much slower

Keto cakes
------

The nutritionist indicates a low carbohydrate diet. So, together with my wife, we have been looking for low carb products and preparations. We have learned about almond flours and coconut flours.

I learned how to make cakes with almond and coconut flour.
