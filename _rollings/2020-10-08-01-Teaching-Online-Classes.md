Due to the pandemic, the medical informatics classes that I teach at the San Sebastian University must be carried out remotely.

Online Education
======

ogether with Dr Jorge Toledo, we have taught this subject for several years. This is a subject with a great practical component of using software and analysis of practical cases.

In general, this subject requires face-to-face activities to support students in handling image processing software.

Unfortunately, the world situation makes face-to-face activities impossible for the moment. In addition, due to the same situation, the participation of the students in the fixed schedules is optional. This makes it difficult for students to achieve the depth of handling the tools in the appropriate times so that they are able to use and take advantage of the subject correctly.

For the moment the objective is to transmit the most central concepts and that they at least reach a basic mastery of the tools
