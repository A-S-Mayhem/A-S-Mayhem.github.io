New day, new session of spectral photography. Today to work with copper pellets.

The Samples
======

Our industrial partner (Secret Agent 001, SA001) provided us with another set of samples.

In this opportunity we have two sets of 15 samples of pellet material used for steelmaking processes.

Each data set provides samples in two different formats.

On the one hand we have samples with small spheres of a few centimeters of radius that correspond to the original state of the pellet material.

In addition, a powdered version of the pellet material is available. This version of the material was used for laboratory analysis of the mineral composition.

The amount of material is really small but maybe enough for our systems

Finally it was a quiet afternoon capturing hyperspectral images. I like the heat produced by the halogen lamps. It is appreciated in these days that are starting to get colder.
