Currently I am part of the committee of co-owners of the Don Nicolas Building community. We have been trying to keep the supply of sanitary supplies to a minimum, but it is complex due to the lack of control by the government.

Finding basic supplies

Some ugly designed info for the community
------

We need a designer!! The manager of the building just resigned his position. We are now attempting to keep the community working as required. We found some templates for information, but the colors and design are a little old fashioned XD. But for now it is OK.

Estado de Catastrofe
------

The president of Chile, within his powers, may establish various constitutional states of exception to handle complex situations at the national level.

It has been decided to declare a state of national catastrophe. This will imply a curfew for mobilization during the night.
