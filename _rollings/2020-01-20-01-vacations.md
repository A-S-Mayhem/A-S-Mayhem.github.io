This beautiful time of year is coming, the holidays! Where everyone stops coming to university and I can work alone and calm.

The university closes every year for the month of February. Students get their well-deserved break, and most staff and students have a month to share with their family.

It is an exciting time, it is the month when I can work quietly at the university with minimal interaction with humans.

I am coordinating the projects and activity planning of what to have ready for March.

The preparations
======

The new shaker
------

Summer is hot and having cold liquids or cold fruit and vegetable smoothies is always important. Now I have a small device to prepare my little shakes.
