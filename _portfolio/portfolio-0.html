For this Project, I designed an API for big data analysis platform using SQL and Kafka that enables clients to directly generate analysis results from large datasets.<br/>
<!--<br/><b>1. Simple Recommender</b>: This system used overall TMDB Vote Count and Vote Averages to build Top Movies Charts, in general and for a specific genre. The IMDB Weighted Rating System was used to calculate ratings on which the sorting was finally performed.-->
<!--<br/><br/><b>2. Content Based Recommender</b>: We built two content based engines; one that took movie overview and taglines as input and the other which took metadata such as cast, crew, genre and keywords to come up with predictions. We also devised a simple filter to give greater preference to movies with more votes and higher ratings.-->
<!--<br/><br/><b>3.Collaborative Filtering</b>: We used the powerful Surprise Library to build a collaborative filter based on single value decomposition. The RMSE obtained was less than 1 and the engine gave estimated ratings for a given user and movie.-->
<!--<br/><br/><b>4.Hybrid Engine</b>: We brought together ideas from content and collaborative filterting to build an engine that gave movie suggestions to a particular user based on the estimated ratings that it had internally calculated for that user.-->
