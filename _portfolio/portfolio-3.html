Design and fabrication of an stretchable and miniaturized brain implantable device following a modular structure approach to the design. 
Implemented stages are antenna, conditioner circuit and shank. The implant was fabricated using a flexible substrate of Polyimide and encapsulated by PDMS for chronic implantation. 
Finite element method was run on COMSOL Multiphysics for mechanical simulation.
