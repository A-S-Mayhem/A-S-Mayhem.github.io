title: "Neural Representation of Direction in Exploration and Navigation"
excerpt: "We show different direction classification performance in neural networks during environmental exploration and navigation processes. We also observed a relationship between individual differences in the classification strength in each brain region and navigation performance. <br/><img src='/images/travel_brain.png'>"

Previous studies have discovered head direction signals in the brain using repeated exposure of heading stimuli. Previous researchers have also classified head direction signals when exploring in an open space, but whether head direction signals can be classified in the brain in a complex environment remains an open question. 

In the experiment, participants first explored the maze by pressing buttons in an fMRI scanner. The task during the exploration phase was to find 9 objects located in the environment and remember their locations. You can watch a demo of the test phase in the video. In the test phase, participants were asked to start from one object location to go to another object location within limited time.

This study suggests that we can successfully discriminate between head directions in different brain regions. More specifically, in retrosplenial cortex, extrastriate cortex, and the whole brain we could only discriminate between directions during the exploration phase but not in the test phase, while in precuneus and thalamus we could discriminate between directions in both the exploration and test phases.
