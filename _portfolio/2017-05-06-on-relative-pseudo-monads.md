Nicola Gambino gave a very neat talk on his recent joint work with M. Fiore, M. Hyland, and G. Winskel. You can find their paper on arxiv here: [Relative pseudomonads, Kleisli bicategories, and substitution monoidal structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03678). 

Today, I am just going to give a very brief summary of my take from the talk. You should read the paper if this summary interests you. Okay, then! Here we go. 

He started by putting their work into a proper context by drawing the following table on the whiteboard<sup>1</sup>.   

|         | Traditional | Kleisli | Relative |
|:--------|:------------|:-------:|---------:|
| 1-dimensional| standard notion of monad   | Kleisli triple [1]  | relative monad [2]   |
| 2-dimensional   | pseudo-monad  | no-iteration pseudo-monad [3]  | _relative pseudo-monad_ [4] |

1. One of the few negative aspects of being a student in Birmingham CS is lack of access to blackboards. It's whiteboards everywhere. Even, in the school of mathematics there are not many blackboards. I totally miss them. Some of us in theory group raised our voices to mention this to the head of school a year ago but nothing happened. Perhaps we should start carrying our own blackboards like these great folks: [the Kurdish teachers in western mountains of Iran](http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/review/kurdish-teachers-carrying-blackboards-their-backs-look-students-hills-iran).
