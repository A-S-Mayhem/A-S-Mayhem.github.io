This term project is a digital piano design with a VGA screen as the piano template, a buzzer as the sound output, a note indicator on the 7-segment display, prerecorded songs, and switches as piano keys. The tool can output 8 octaves of notes. The main aim of this project is to help the beginner piano players to get familiar with the logic of the piano.
