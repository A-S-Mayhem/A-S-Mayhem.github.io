ASELSAN, Inc.

The problem of minimizing the error of measurement of source localization is within the scope of optimization. Therefore, the researched methods are least squares, iterative least squares, gradient descent, and Gauss-Newton. Finally, the methods are evaluated according to Cramer-Rao lower bound.
