This figure was created for a fieldwork report for my masterâ€™s degree. It displays the modeled surface energy balance from [COSIPY](https://cryo-tools.org/tools/cosipy/) which was forced by PROMICE automatic weather station data. It shows the different components that contribute to the available melt energy at the glacier surface, which change dramatically over the study period.

*Figure 1: (a) The SEB at KAN-L AWS modelled by COSIPY, where SW_net, LW_net, H, LE, QR and QG are
defined as positive when they transfer heat to the ice surface. The air temperature, wind speed at 3 m and the total
available melt energy are also shown.(b) The resultant individual mass components from LE and relative humidity.
Despite a negative LE cooling the surface, it leads to a negative mass change due to evaporation and sublimation
processes. (c) The total hourly rainfall from the nearest grid point to KAN-L from the ERA5T data. Also shown
is the total daily surface melt calculated by the COSIPY model.*
