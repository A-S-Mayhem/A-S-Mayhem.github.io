The leadershipdata package is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/zhgarfield/leadershipdata) and archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4018788). It includes researcher-coded variables from 1,212 ethnographic paragraphs extracted from the [electronic Human Relations Area Files](https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/). These data were used in the publications by [Garfield et al., (2019)](https://zhgarfield.github.io/publication/2019b_garfield_et_al-HN) and [Garfield et al., (2020)](https://zhgarfield.github.io/publication/2020_garfield_et_al_EHB).
