[Implementations](https://github.com/andrewherren/implementations) is a Github 
repo with simple implementations of common statistical and mathematical algorithms. 
The goal of this repo is to enable easy exploration of the challenges and tradeoffs 
inherent in statistics and machine learning methods, not to provide robust 
implementations for use in research or applications.
