[Boolean Search Techniques LibGuide](https://uncg-lis.libguides.com/c.php?g=929817)

I developed this LibGuide learning module to show how to build (write) and execute (run) Boolean searches. You may move at your own pace through this learning module. Each concept is explained and illustrated in detail. Each page contains a link to a search engine, which allows you opportunities to practice what you have learned.

The word "Boolean" refers to a mathematical logic model used in computing. It is the name given to a method of searching databases that requires using specific "Operators" and "Modifiers" to build search statements (queries). As you become skilled in using Boolean search, you should find it significantly improves your ability to find information you need.
