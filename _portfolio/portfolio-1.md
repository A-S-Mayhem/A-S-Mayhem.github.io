title: "Object Detection, Tracking and Suspicious Activity Recognition for
Maritime Surveillance using Thermal Vision"
excerpt: "With this project, we propose a system that is capable not only to detect objects within the surveillance 
area but also to detect a set of pre-identified suspicious activities 
happening within the borders. We believe this will be an ideal replacement to the 
current system available which is to manually detect both objects and classify 
activities as suspicious or not. With the detection of any such suspicious activities, the 
system is capable of alerting the relevant authorities in real-time which makes it superior to the available traditional method with an additional benefit of increased safety of 
security personnel. One key objective of this project is to be able to detect both objects and 
activities happening at any time of the day. Hence, thermal imagery is used for 
the development of the models and for real-time detection.
