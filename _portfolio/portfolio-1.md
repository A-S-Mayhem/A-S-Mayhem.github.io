## Not Creepy Elf

The *Not Creepy Elf* project aims to create a distinctive electronic decoration to enhance holiday celebrations, specifically for Halloween and Christmas. This product is designed to meet users' desire for a spooky decoration during Halloween and seamlessly transition into a playful “Elf on the Shelf” character for Christmas. The Not Creepy Elf is intended to delight guests with a combination of fright, humor, and excitement, making it an appealing addition not only for holiday gatherings but also for year-round enjoyment.

This interactive decoration offers two customizable modes for Halloween and Christmas. In Halloween mode, it delivers lighthearted scares to create a thrilling atmosphere, while in Christmas mode, it provides a family-friendly, festive experience. Although the Not Creepy Elf is crafted to entertain, it may also surprise users, achieving the intended spooky effect for Halloween but with a gentler approach for Christmas.

#### Technical Specifications

The Not Creepy Elf’s design incorporates a PSoC microcontroller, programmed within the PSoC Creator IDE, to control and manage interactions. Key components and features include:

*	A PIR motion sensor, controlled via analog input, to detect nearby movement.
*	A DC motor connected to a motor driver, regulated through pulse-width modulation (PWM).
*	An accelerometer, read through analog input, to enable responsive, interactive movement.
*	A temperature sensor using I2C communication, adding environmental adaptability.

The schematic and PCB layout for the Not Creepy Elf were developed using Cadence Allegro.
