As part of my research masters at the University of Sheffield, I had the oppurtunity to go on fieldwork to Russell Glacier in west Greenland. This fieldwork involved collecting various measurements of the proglacial river hydrology, surface melt and on-ice GPS locations, culminating in a research report.

To aid in the analysis of the meteorological conditions during the study period I modelled the surface energy balance utilising measurements from an automatic weather station and the [COSIPY model](https://cryo-tools.org/tools/cosipy/). This provided insights into how daily weather variability affects the individual contributions of the surface energy budget.
