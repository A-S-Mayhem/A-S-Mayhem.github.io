This project is a personal portfolio with my photography. 
It is built with Hugo and hosted on Netlify. 

The theme is based on [Bootstrapious](http://bootstrapious.com/) theme by Kishan B. 

The theme is modified to fit my needs and licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), you can check the [original theme license](https://bootstrapious.com/p/creative-portfolio).
