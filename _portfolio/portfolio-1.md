Origin Chain Networks (OCN) is a tech startup with the mission to forge a future of food we can trust. Their mission is to promote fairness and incentivise participation with a bottom-up, farmer-first data ownership model and an accessible mobile farming solution.

I worked on a team of 50 technology specialists to build an open-source Earth Observation reference dataset for classifying commercial crops and farm-peripheral habitats. This dataset can be used by food industry bodies to contextualize on-farm data that is self-reported by farmers.
