This project was a transformative experience that deepened my understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of robotics. From a technical perspective, I gained hands-on expertise in robot kinematics , particularly in implementing forward and inverse kinematics algorithms for a 7-DOF robotic arm — a challenging configuration due to its redundancy and complex joint-space dynamics.

I became proficient in using ROS (Robot Operating System) as the central communication framework, enabling real-time data exchange between the virtual interface and the physical robot. This involved developing custom nodes for sensor feedback, motor control, and trajectory execution, which gave me a strong foundation in robot middleware and system integration .

Working with Unity 3D for VR simulation allowed me to explore the intersection of robotics and immersive technologies. I learned how to create interactive environments, simulate robotic behavior, and synchronize virtual models with real-world hardware — skills that are increasingly valuable in fields like remote operations, digital twins, and human-in-the-loop automation.

One of the most rewarding challenges was designing the user interface and interaction model within the VR environment. It required a balance between intuitive design and technical accuracy, ensuring that operators could control the robot effectively while receiving meaningful visual and haptic feedback.

From a team collaboration standpoint, this project strengthened my ability to work in a multidisciplinary environment. We had to manage timelines, delegate responsibilities, and integrate diverse components — from mechanical design and embedded systems to software development and user experience. These experiences improved my communication, problem-solving, and project management skills.

Finally, presenting the project at national and international competitions helped me refine my ability to articulate technical content clearly and confidently to both experts and general audiences — a skill that continues to serve me well in professional settings.

Overall, this thesis project not only expanded my technical toolkit but also reinforced my passion for human-robot interaction , remote robotic systems , and the future of immersive control interfaces in industrial and hazardous environments.
