Built a learned hierarchical bidirectional video compression model that utilizes motion predictions and allows achievement of multiple rate-distortion tradeoffs using single motion compression network with varying intra-frame coding networks.

For further information, please refer to the [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EPeK4Fpj-0r8shqzkSkJuaVayt2f4GvD/view?usp=sharing) I have prepared for my thesis.

The code for the proposed network can be found in [Github](https://github.com/erenovic/Bidirectional-Video-Compression-with-Motion-Refinement).
