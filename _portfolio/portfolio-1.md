This is a project done at the University of Malaga during a final Project Report. The aim of this project was to develope an ElectroCardioGraph(ECG), a device that can measure the heart's electrical signal generated during the systole and diastole of atriums and ventricles of this human organ. After obtaining that data, a signal processing was developed based on the Pan-Tompkins Algorythm in order to obtain the peak rate and then a possible control or action can be made after detecting an anomalous process.

This GITHUB project has been organised to distribute all the documents in different folders.

The project is written in Spanish language. Anyway, the formal data and code can be read perfectly as well as the pictures given.

The project is available in: https://github.com/GGChe/ECG_DataAcquisition
