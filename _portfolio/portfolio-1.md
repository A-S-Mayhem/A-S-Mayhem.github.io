Worked with a minimum coarse-grained model to understand the physical mechanisms involved in translating sequential changes in ESCRT-III polymer composition into membrane deformation and cargo release. I Investigated how cargo size influences the robustness and efficiency of this working model through molecular dynamics simulations in LAMMPS. The results from my research were published in 'PLOS Computational Biology' (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010586).
