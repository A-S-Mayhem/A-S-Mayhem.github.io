Abstract

This paper describes a comparison of classical and machine learning
methods for the prediction of demand of breakfast cereals. A literature
review on predicting demand with discrete choice models and
machine learning methods is provided. A utility based linear demand
model serves as theoretical basis. The applied methods are explained,
then data is simulated to allow for the assignment of coecients and
variation of features. Data pre-processing is done before tting the
models. Results show that machine learning methods outperform
classical methods, when working with large number of features.
