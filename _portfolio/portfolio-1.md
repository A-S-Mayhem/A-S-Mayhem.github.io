title: "Advancing Single Cell Genomics towards Better Molecular Medicine"
excerpt: "I was a key part of the Tabula Sapiens Consortium. We generated a multi-organ, single-cell transcriptomic atlas of humans. This atlas will be a reference for researchers attempting to understand the molecular basis of diseases \n <br/><img src='/images/reduced_ts_figure.png'>"

excerpt: "Independently, I used human B cells as a model to investigate a key question in developmental biology: during cell reprogramming, how do cells integrate extrinsic signals with their intrinsic cellular state? Using single-cell genoimcs, I was able to quantify the relative contribution of intrinsic cellular status. It was a strong effect, revealing that adding  extrinsic factors like cytokines to cells  is only part of the equation for reprogramming. These findings have important implications for long-standing goals of reprogramming or controlling cells for cell-based therapies and tissue engineering. <br/><img src='/images/lineage_tracing.png'>"
