To understand evolution, we need to understand who gets to reproduce. 
Or at least have a model for it. In diploid organisms, 
we also need to figure out who reproduces with whom. 
This is very hard to understand! Geneticists often simply assume that individuals mate
at random. This is mathematically convenient, but in practice geography 
and other barriers break this assumption. 

In this project, we are interested in what happens when such barriers are removed, and 
previously isolated populations meet. In humans, for example, 
transatlantic travel and transatlantic 
slave trade meant that populations living in different parts of the world
were brought together. We also found that this kind of process likely was common in 
early human history.
