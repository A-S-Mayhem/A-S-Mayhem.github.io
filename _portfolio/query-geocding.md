excerpt: " <img src='/images/geocoder-02-01-2.gif'>" style='width:2000px;'> | *Highlighting people in a crowd violating social distancing protocol using detection and depth. Using an unconstrained input video we can infer depth and detect people who are close together.* <br/> <br/>

[comment]: <> (Built a simple social distance violation detection tool using Faster-RCNN, OpenCV and a monocular depth estimation algorithm developed using Pytorch. The tool can take a video as input and highlight people who are close together and are not maintaining social distance.)
