Parisian has a rich cultural history and although I grew up there, I still don't know the origin behind the names of most metro stations which are grounded in historical events. I developed an app to get historical insights behind metro stations in Paris, which maps all metro locations on a 2d grid (organized by lines) and links them to a description of their name's origin. A preview of it can be found [here](https://youtu.be/P3YZqTRIS44).
