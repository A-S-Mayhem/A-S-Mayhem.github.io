This project serves as a refresher for Object Oriented Programming concepts - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
In addition, a practice project on multi level tic-tac-toe board game is implemented in Python. Currently, the game can be played in the python console. Future versions may be deployed on Streamlit or any other GUI platform.
