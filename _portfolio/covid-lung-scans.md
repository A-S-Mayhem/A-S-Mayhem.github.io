## Introduction

CT scans plays a supportive role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and is a key procedure for determining the severity that the patient finds himself in.
Models that can find evidence of COVID-19 and/or characterize its findings can play a crucial role in optimizing diagnosis and treatment, especially in areas with a shortage of expert radiologists.
This dataset contains 20 CT scans of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as segmentations of lungs and infections made by experts.

From my time in academic sciences I've learnt that before conducting any experiement or analysis of results there should be a some questions asked. This is in order to understand what exactly you're trying to solve from investigating the data, what you assume the outcomes will be and what you are trying to prove wrong. These questions present themselves and the Hypothesis and Null Hypothesis. 

## Why is AI & Machine Learning necessary?
An article by Claire Jarvis in The Scientist titled [AI Learns from Lung CT Scans to Diagnose COVID-19](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/ai-learns-from-lung-ct-scans-to-diagnose-covid-19-67625) Highlighted the lack of resources avialable for nasal testing kits. COVID has a high transmision rate and testing within hospitals and local communities are key all over the world in order to slow the rate of transmission and identify hotspots of the disease. 

###Â Hypothesis: The machine learning prediction model will be able to categorise and identify any lung ct scans that indicate the presence of COVID-19 in 98% of cases. 

## Tasks 
1. Segmenentation - segmentation of findings can shed light into how severe the situation of the patient is. 
2. Lung segmentation to increase the performance of supervised models

## Data import

Importing the packages and libraries necessary is one of the first steps to writing any code base. We don't want to re-invent the wheelhouse. Programming is more about speeding up processes and building ontop of existing code in order to find insights or a solution.


```python
import glob 
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
```


```python
# As the raw data files are in the *.nii format we need to import the nibabel 
import nibabel as nib 
```


```python
import os
cwd = os.getcwd()
```

Within the dataset provided by kaggle there is a a metadata csv file which provides all of the file paths for sub directories.


```python
raw_df = pd.read_csv('input/covid19-ct-scans/metadata.csv')
```


```python
#The metadata csv file contains all of the file paths for each of the CT images within the dataset provided by kaggle. 
# Loading the data frame head to get an ouline of the data.
raw_df.head()
```

First, to ensure we're able to load each image file by reading the file path and using the nibel package to load the data. 


```python
#select the first file path in the first column
first_scan = raw_df['ct_scan'][0]
print(first_scan)
```

    input/covid19-ct-scans/ct_scans/coronacases_org_001.nii



```python
# As all the data has the "../" prefix in the dataframe this cause in an error with loading it in Jupyter notebook. 
# Use of a lambda function to strip this from the front of the string
raw_df['ct_scan'] = raw_df['ct_scan'].map(lambda x: x.lstrip('../').rstrip('aAbBcC'))
```


```python
print(first_scan)
```

    input/covid19-ct-scans/ct_scans/coronacases_org_001.nii


## Nibabel image processing 


```python
ct_scan = nib.load(first_scan)
```


```python
array = ct_scan.get_fdata()
```


```python
# refactor the above code into a function:
def read_nii(filepath):
    '''
    Reads .nii file and returns pixel array
    '''
    ct_scan = nib.load(filepath)
    ct_array   = ct_scan.get_fdata()
    ct_array = ct_array.T
    # Return an image using maplot lib 
    return plt.imshow(ct_array[200])
```


```python
read_nii(first_scan)
```
