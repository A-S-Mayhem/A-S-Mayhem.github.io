This project is my end of study project @CentraleSup√©lec for the French presidential election of 2022.   
It is a political chatbot built with [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) the image is dockerized and deployed on a VM.  
Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ArianeDlns/chatbot-presidentielle2022).   

See the implemented architecture:

The user interacts with the chatbot via Telegram, which sends the messages to the Rasa NLU via connectors, where it identifies the intent, and responds to the Rasa Core, according to stories and actions. The models used for the conversation were generated by the trainer module and then transferred to the bot; these models can be versioned and evolved between bots.
