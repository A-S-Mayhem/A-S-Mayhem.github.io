[Script](https://github.com/alexanderquispe/Scraper_Legacy_Obituaries/blob/main/Script_Scraper_Legacy_Obituaries.ipynb): I created an scraper for the Legacy Obituaries webpage to extract information about Professors from all Universities in the USA who died between 2000-2015. This was part of a research project of the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition. We seek to find if there were a relationship between the death of a Professor and their Phd student's placement.
