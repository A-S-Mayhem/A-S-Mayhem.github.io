[Script](https://github.com/alexanderquispe/ECO224/blob/main/Labs/replication_6/Group5_Lab6_R.ipynb) : Using causal forests, we obtain that the treatment was significantly positive on average (ATE=0.248). Also, it is found that there are significant heterogeneous effects along the fixed mindset variable by school, $X1$. In contrast, no marked heterogeneous effects are found for the performance level variable by school, $X2$. On the other hand, we find that the absence of clustering makes the distribution of the estimated CATE more dispersed.
