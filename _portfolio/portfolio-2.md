This project aims to automate the setup procedure for running Dynamic Mechanical Analysis tests on magneto-active elastomers for determining the viscoelastic properties. MATLAB was used to create the software to control the setup by considering accesibility as MATLAB was the prominent software in the lab. 
Optimal settings have been preset for the oscilloscope and the amplifier in order to optimize the duration for the time constant while still accounting for accuracy. Different setting for the app has been documented in the github link below:
