The plastic waste is a severe environment problem, which does damage to surface water, soil, the ocean, and the life in the world. In recent years, more and more plastics are generated and enter the environment without proper process. To solve this problem, we write this memo to introduce our plan to reduce single-use and disposable plastic product waste. The plan includes a target level of global single-use or disposable plastic product waste, a timeline to achieve the goal, and some main factors that may influence the timeline. To determine the exact number, we develop a mathematical modal to research and calculate, as well as collect the necessary data to help calculating.
