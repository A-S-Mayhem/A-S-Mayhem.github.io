As I continue my journey in the field of Data Science, I strive to document and replicate a diverse range of concepts. This repository serves as a valuable resource for my learning and growth. Currently, it includes:
- [PySpark code for data cleaning and manipulation](https://github.com/ryputtam/misc_learn_lab/tree/main/01_spark_df_basics)
- [Custom Transformer and Model Reusability in Spark ML Library](https://github.com/ryputtam/misc_learn_lab/tree/main/02_LR_spakMLlib)
- [Lambda and apply basic functions explore in Python](https://github.com/ryputtam/misc_learn_lab/tree/main/03_lambda_runs)
- [Create bins using pandas .cut and .qcut functions](https://github.com/ryputtam/misc_learn_lab/tree/main/04_custom_bins)
- [Natural Language Processing Basics](https://github.com/ryputtam/misc_learn_lab/tree/main/05_NLP)
