# Project Overview

This project represents the collaborative effort of a two-person team, serving as the final project for MAE-207 (Haptic Device). We designed and built a force feedback 'steering wheel' using four servo motors linked to a central joystick rod. The joystick rod was fixed to three DOF joystick controllers for precise object control. We also created a virtual environment in *Processing* with diverse obstacle designs. When the virtual 'car' approached an obstacle, the 'steering wheel' provided force feedback based on the current speed, preventing collisions. This project showcased our expertise in hardware design, software development, and interactive simulations.

## Note of the corresponding course

The MAE-207-Haptic devise I took was taught by Professor Tania Morimoto. This course provides an introduction to the design and control of haptic systems, which provide tactile feedback to human users interacting with virtual environments and teleoperated robots. Topics include *haptic-focused mechatronic design, system modeling, and analysis (kinematics and dynamics), human-in-the-loop feedback control, and haptic feedback evaluation*.
