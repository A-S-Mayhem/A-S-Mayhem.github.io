Imagine you are on your way walking to a Starbucks, you can hear birds singing up in the tree, and feel the breeze touching your skin. Suddenly, you notice a bunny running by. Where did it go? You turned your head to follow the bunny running and hiding into a nearby bush, while your feet are still walking toward your destination. In this case, where you are facing toward and where you are moving toward are both part of your sense of direction, but they represent different spatial information: head direction refers to where someone is facing toward, while travel direction refers to the direction of one’s body movement. 

In daily life, people usually conflate the two directions, thinking where we are facing toward is where we are going, but as you have seen in the bunny example, these two factors can offer different spatial information. Extensive studies have focused on head direction cells in the brain. Although head direction has been found to be a crucial part of human navigation, travel direction might be more important to determining the travel trajectory. However, it is unclear whether travel direction plays a primary role in navigation. 

We used a motion adaptation paradigm to probe for selectivity of travel direction. Here are the results for the control condition, shown in red, and the adaptation condition, shown in blue. We found a difference between the people’s report of the net change of travel direction in the adaptation condition and in the control condition, as you can see in the difference between the two lines. The results indicate a motion aftereffect of travel direction, suggesting that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation. Interestingly, subjects had a higher frequency of reporting net travel toward the adapted direction, indicating that the aftereffect is opposite to the traditional motion aftereffect.
