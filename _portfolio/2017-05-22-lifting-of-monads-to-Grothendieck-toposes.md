Suppose $T: \cat{C} \to  \catC$ is a monad on $\cat{C}$. We are intereted in answering the question that under which conditions on $\cat{C}$ it is possible to lift $T$ to $\psh{C}$ and to $\sh{C}$. In order to answer this question, in this post I am going to highlight some of relevant defintions and results that are elaborated in my . For more details of proofs and more examples you should have a look there too.
