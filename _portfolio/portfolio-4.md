Used reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) framework for image colourisation. Additionally developed a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance the accessibility of our program.
The first column of both rows show the original image, while the next three columns mostly show the reconstructions (from black and white versions of the original images) using different parameters.
