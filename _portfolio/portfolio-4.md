title: "BLE Based Indoor Positioning System"
excerpt: "Indoor positioning systems enable locating the position of objects or people within buildings. There are different indoor positioning techniques available including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), WiFi, UWB, Near Field Communication (NFC), etc. GPS is unreliable for indoor spaces because there is no line of sight with the GPS satellites.

This project mainly focuses on an RSSI-based BLE Indoor positioning method. BLE is among the first technologies used for indoor tracking and it is widely used because of its significantly low power consumption and high adoption rate in common electronic appliances. Even though the latencies are high and data transfer capacities are low, it is not much of an issue for our purpose as data is sent periodically and only in small chunks..
