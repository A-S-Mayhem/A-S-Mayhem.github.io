In Graphs and Networks, a node can be part of multiple communities. In simple words, let’s take Facebook friend list of a person ‘X’ and divide the list into communities such as school friends, gym friends, college friends, friends from work and so on. A friend can belong to one or more communities. This project aims to find out the overlapping communities in the given network.
