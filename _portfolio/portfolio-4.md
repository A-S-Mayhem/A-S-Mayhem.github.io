title: "Analysing the impact of Covid-19 on Global Economy"
excerpt: "This project that is also compiled in a book chapter, we divulged into analysing the impact of news headlines of Covid-19 on Global Economy. Current Sentiment Analysis methods donâ€™t account for discrepancies caused due to medical jargons, hence results produced during the pandemic were optimistically positive, not matching with stock trends. We created our own dictionary that also took into account medical terminologies and applied lexicon analysis to calculating the sentiment value of each news headline in the pandemic period. We then applied regression to the sentiments and were able to predict the stock index value, based on financial history, thus analysing the global economy."
