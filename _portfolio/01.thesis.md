Abstract

This paper describes a comparison of classical and machine learning
methods for the prediction of demand of breakfast cereals. A literature
review on predicting demand with discrete choice models and
machine learning methods is provided. A utility based linear demand
model serves as theoretical basis. The applied methods are explained,
then data is simulated to allow for the assignment of coefficients and
variation of features. Data pre-processing is done before fitting the
models. Results show that machine learning methods outperform
classical methods, when working with large number of features.
