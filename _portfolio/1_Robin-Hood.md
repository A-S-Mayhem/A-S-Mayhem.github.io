The Robin Hood of Wall Street is a project that combines several things: finance and trading, building computer algorithms, traveling to remote places and helping those people in the world who are struggling to survive.

We design computer algorithms to pick stocks and run an endowment fund based on the results with intention to grant the returns to selected charities.
