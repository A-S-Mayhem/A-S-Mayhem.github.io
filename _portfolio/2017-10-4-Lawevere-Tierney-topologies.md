Myles Tierney died on October 6, 2017 at age 80. He was one of the influential category theorists particularly in the earlier days of development of category theory, and made important contributions to category theory in collaboration with Bill Lawvere and with André Joyal.

We saw it fit to have a session in our category reading group discussing [Lawvere Tierney topologies](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lawvere-Tierney+topology), something that we wanted to know for a while, and to honour Tierney's contribution to beautiful subject of topos theory. 

Here is supplementary notes to my talk which I gave in CARGO on October 24:
