Whilst we have eyes to see whether people are adhering to the new guidlines on face masks, there is room for automation and AI in detecting this when it comes to quarentine procedures, border control and adherance to social guidlines in public places.

# Project: Creating a face mask detector with Tensor flow, Keras & Python

Masks have become one of the most essential commodities of 2020 in ways we never predicted. The WHO organisation, in a complete U-turn recommended the use of masks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and many countries have adapted this spesicifc recommendation into laws and legislation for public gatherings, shopping and even transport. In the UK, [Face coverings were made mandatory for public transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/face-coverings-to-become-mandatory-on-public-transport?target="_blank") from the 15th June 2020 and in shops shortly followed on 24th July.
