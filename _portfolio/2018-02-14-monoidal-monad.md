`Abstract:`
In the talk, I introduce well-known and by now classical notion of monoidal monads. They are oplax monads on a monoidal category such that the monoidal structures are compatible with monad structures. This compatility is stated by several coherence axioms. I will then show that oplax monoidal structures of the monad making it an oplax monoidal monad is in one-to-one correspondence with monoidal structures of the Eilenbergâ€“Moore category of algebras of that monad such that the forgetful functor from the category of algebras to the base category is strict monoidal. In other words, we get a lifting of the tensor structures of base category to tensor structures of the category of algebras over its objects.
