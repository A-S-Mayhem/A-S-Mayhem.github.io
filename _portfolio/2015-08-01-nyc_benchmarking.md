This project started as a final project with classmates from my Data Visualization class in Spring 2015 while I was a master's student at [NYU CUSP](http://cusp.nyu.edu/). During that time I was also a graduate research assistant in the lab of [Dr. Constantine Kontokosta](http://www.urbanintelligencelab.org/) and after the DataVis class was over, we worked with the [NYC Mayor's Office of Sustainability](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/sustainability/index.page) to deploy the site publicly as the official energy and water benchmarking website of MOS.
