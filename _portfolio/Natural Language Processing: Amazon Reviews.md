Project for the course: Machine Learning Methods in Economics at the University of Hamburg

This projekt involves the loading and pre-processing of amazon reviews and their ratings, 
the fitting of an artificial Deep Neural Network capable of being trained on up to 3,6 million observations (the size of the sample). 
A smaller sample is used for computational speed, however the methods don't change. Implementation is done using Python and a remote GPU.
