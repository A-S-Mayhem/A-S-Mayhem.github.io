The Isola Group is a global company that services the manufacturing industry by producing and supplying a range of products and raw materials. Their Chandler plant is designed specifically to produce copper-fiberglass laminate for PCBs, with a focus on high-speed turnaround low-volume custom substrate. Isola has identified the current copper foil roll changeover solution on their assembly line as a bottleneck. It is currently a slow, partially manual process, and speeding up this portion of the assembly line would allow them to take on more next-day clients, fill more orders, and generate more value. Team 24 has been tasked with designing a solution that can decrease the copper foil changeover time and remove the bottleneck in their line. The deliverables consist of a detailed mechanical and electrical design, a bill of materials (BOM) of the completed solution, and a budget for a completed solution. The solution’s scope is limited to the beginning of the process at the copper foil pallet staged at the machine and ending with loading the copper foil rolls onto the existing chucks.
