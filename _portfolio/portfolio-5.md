[Script](https://github.com/alexanderquispe/ECO224/blob/main/Labs/replication_5/Group5_lab5_R_2.ipynb) : It was found that for the subgroup where q(quarter of the experiment in which the participant was enrolled)=5, female=0(male), q6=0, durable=0(non-manufacturing occupation) and agegt54(older than 54 years)=1, the HTE is -0.26. The most positive HTE corresponds to the subgroup in which q5=0, female=1,agelt35=1,q6=1,Husd=0 with a value of 1.1. On the contrary, the most negative HTE was for the subgroup where q5=0, female=0,q6=0,durable=1,lusd=0,q4=0,agelt35=0,factor(dep)=0 with a value of -0.86.
