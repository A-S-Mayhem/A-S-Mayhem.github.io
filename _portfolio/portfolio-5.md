title: "Interpreting AI: Telecom Churn data, SMS Spam Detection and Breast Cancer Predictions"
excerpt: "I worked on a project that aimed to predict whether and why would a customer leave the telecom service. This was a multilabel classification problem for which I used SVM and XGBoost to predict the customerâ€™s position and then interpreted the reason for leaving using LIME. Also explained SMS Spam predictions. 
I am currently working on a project where using CNN I am predicting the nature of the tumour on images of breast cancer tissues. This prediction is then to be explained using SHAP. The aim of this project is to increase understanding predictions on medical data, to add on to dependability of such models.
