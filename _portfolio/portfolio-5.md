This project combines the immersive experience of AR with hand detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and real-time audio processing. The application captures video from a webcam, detects hand positions in each frame, and transforms audio based on these positions, creating an interactive and immersive VR DJ experience. The aim of this project is to pioneer a new wave of interactivity in DJing, setting the stage for a future where DJs not only play music but also dance alongside their audience, creating a more engaging and dynamic performance experience. All code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/elieattias1/AR-DJ).
