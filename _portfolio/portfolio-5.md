The Isola Group is a global company that services the manufacturing industry by producing and supplying a range of products and raw materials. Their Chandler plant is designed specifically to produce copper-fiberglass laminate for PCBs, with a focus on high-speed turnaround low-volume custom substrate. Isola has identified the current copper foil roll changeover solution on their assembly line as a bottleneck. It is currently a slow, partially manual process, and speeding up this portion of the assembly line would allow them to take on more next-day clients, fill more orders, and generate more value. Team 24 has been tasked with designing a solution that can decrease the copper foil changeover time and remove the bottleneck in their line. The deliverables consist of a detailed mechanical and electrical design, a bill of materials (BOM) of the completed solution, and a budget for a completed solution. The solution’s scope is limited to the beginning of the process at the copper foil pallet staged at the machine and ending with loading the copper foil rolls onto the existing chucks.


Isola's current copper foil roll changeover solution is largely a manual process and takes 2 min which is far longer than it should, decreasing their ability to fill out next-day Printed Circuit Board (PCB) orders. Along with that it currently can only hold 2 rolls, because of this it has become a bottleneck in the PCB material production line.
Designed two independent hoists to pick up and change copper rolls (700 lbs) used for PCB manufacturing. Worked with a team of three other students on a project for the Chandler facility of the Isola Corporation.
Our team iterated design prototypes, generated specifications, wrote frequent status updates, and used modern project management tools to complete the project. I worked on the CAD design of the X-axis moment, electrical schematics, wiring harnesses, and allowances, and advised on the other subsystems. Deliverables included CAD files, layouts, BOM, cost and return analysis, FEA and dynamical simulations.
