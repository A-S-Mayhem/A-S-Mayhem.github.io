## This project is related to Web Development and MVT
Architected a fully functional intelligent web application (For instance, if you pass a word with typo, the app will suggest the right word. E.g. Try 'Rainn' in the text box.) 
Deployed the application on Heroku and used PostgreSQL as a database. Colors can be changed with the settings icon shown on the top right corner of the main page.
