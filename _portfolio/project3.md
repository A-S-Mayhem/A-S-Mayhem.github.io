title: "Question Answering on knowledge graphs using DDQN"
excerpt: "RL course Project, 2023
 <br/>
 <br/>
Built an RL-based agent that can answer complex multi-hop questions over a knowledge graph. Used the Doubled DQN algorithm to train the agent to learn to predict a sequence of actions to navigate the
knowledge graph to find the correct answer"
