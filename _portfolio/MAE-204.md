# Project Overview

This two-member group project provided us with a valuable opportunity to delve into the practical application of modern robotic knowledge. Throughout the project, we focused on mastering concepts such as *Rigid-Body Motions, Forward and Inverse Kinematics, Dynamics of Open Chains, and Robot Control*. Our primary objective was to develop proficiency in utilizing this knowledge to effectively control the motion of a UR3 robot-arm within real and virtual environments. By undertaking this project, we gained hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in controlling robotic systems.

## Note of the corresponding course

MAE-204 I took was taught by Professor Michael T. Tolley. This course covers topics in robotics, dynamics, kinematics, mechatronics, control, locomotion, and manipulation.
