This is my bachelor thesis work focusing on the teleoperation and control of acustom 7-DOF robotic arm in a hostile environment and modeling it inside a VR immersive environment, making it easier for the user to interact with the robotic system inside a hostile environment and planning for the motion before excuting it.

- participated with our Graduation project in International DELL EMC Technologies Envision the future competition among more than 210 finalists around the world 2020 and won the 5th place.
- Participated in Egypt IOT & AI challenge competition, graduation projects category 2020 and won the 1st place among all graduation projects in Egypt.
