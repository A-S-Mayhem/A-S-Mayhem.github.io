Synopsis: This work aimed to enhance surface hydrology analysis by incorporating the terrestrial ecosystem responses to various Earth processes in river flow predictions. The ED2+R model integrates the ED2 model with a lateral routing scheme to determine spatiotemporal patterns of river flows in the Tapajós basin, Amazon. The study evaluated the model's performance, demonstrating improved representation of daily to decadal river flow dynamics compared to initial versions lacking river representation.

My responsibilities involved the implementation of the river routing scheme in the Ecosystem Demography, ensuring the accuracy and validity of the model integration.

Outcomes: The integration of ED2 with the lateral routing scheme resulted in a more accurate representation of river flow dynamics in the Tapajós basin. This advancement marked a significant improvement over terrestrial biosphere models without river representation, contributing to a better understanding of how climate change and land use affect surface hydrology in the Amazon region.
