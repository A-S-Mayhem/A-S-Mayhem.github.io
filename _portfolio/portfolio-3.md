This project is a personal project to learn how to use NLP for question answering. The dataset used is [SQuAD](https://deepai.org/dataset/squad) from Stanford. The model used is [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) from Google.

It is a web app built with Streamlit, the aim of this project is to extract information from a text and to find the relevant context to answer a question.
