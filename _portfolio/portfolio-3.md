This project aims to find out the plagiarism in the set of available documents. These documents are submitted by the students for grading and a sample is collected to implement the algorithm. The submitted documents are compared with the original documents (Wikipedia Articles) and the degree of plagiarism (Directly copied, Light revision, heavy revision, non-plagiarism) can be detected.
