[Script](https://github.com/alexanderquispe/ECO224/blob/main/Labs/replication_5/Group5_Lab5_Python.ipynb) : A linear regression model with 1000 bootstrap estimates is used for the control variables, especially for the T4, female and black variables.It is obtained that the estimators obtained with bootstrapping have lower standard errors than those obtained by OLS; that is, with bootstrapping more accurate estimators are obtained.
