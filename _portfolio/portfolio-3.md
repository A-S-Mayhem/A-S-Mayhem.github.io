title: "FPGA Based Processor for Image Downsampling"
excerpt: "The goal of this project is to design a microprocessor specially designed to downsample a given image and the Central Processing Unit (CPU) structure, while simulating it using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) such as Verilog and to implement the given task using a programmable logic device, preferably a Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA).
