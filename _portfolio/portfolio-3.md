Adaptive therapy aims to prolong the life of the patient as much as possible by leveraging competition between drug sensitive and resistant tumour cells. In this report, we explored three different approaches to modelling adaptive therapy: i.) the ordinary differential equation model (the ODE), ii.) the agent based model (ABM), and iii.) the partial differential equation model (PDE). 
The report confirms that cost of resistance is not required for adaptive therapy to outperform continuous therapy. We study how the spatial architecture impacts this problem, concluding that it can have a significant impact on the outcome of the treatment.
