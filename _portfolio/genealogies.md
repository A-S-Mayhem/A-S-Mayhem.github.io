The population of Quebec has many interesting features for geneticists. 
It has diverse ancestry, it experienced rapid population growth through birth and immigration, 
and it is well characterized genetically. 
A unique feature is the existence of deep and complete genealogical records 
(by the [BALSAC project]( https://balsac.uqac.ca/?lang=en)). 
This provides many opportunities to learn about how populations evolve, 
the biology of genomes, and disease. 
Analyzing these large genealogical and genetic datasets requires new algorithms and 
statistical tools.
