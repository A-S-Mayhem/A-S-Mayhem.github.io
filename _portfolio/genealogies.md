The population of Quebec has many interesting features for geneticists. It has diverse ancestry, it experienced rapid population growth through birth and immigration, and it is well characterized genetically. A unique feature is the existence of deep and excellent genealogical records (by the [BALSAC project]( https://balsac.uqac.ca/?lang=en)). This provides many opportunities to learn about how populations evolve, how they differentiate, and the biology of genomes. Analyzing these large datasets also requires new algorithms and statistical tools.
