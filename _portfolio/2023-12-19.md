Introduction: This project addresses the challenges of music audio classification through two distinct tasks on Kaggle datasets, MusicNet and GTZAN. For GTZAN, the objective is genre classification, while for MusicNet, the focus is on identifying composers from the baroque and classical periods. The website is split into 3 primary pages: 
1. Proposal - Project Proposal
2. Midterm Report - Midterm report with intermediary results, exploratory data analysis, and dimensionality reduction.
3. Final Report - Final report with a focus on interpretation and analysis of results, discussion, and concluding remarks.
