## What is mathematical understanding? 

First, I will try of set out some questions concerning mathematical understanding. 

 + If we take the view that mathematical understanding is a process of acquiring mathematical knowledge, then what kind of process is it? What are its attributes? Is it necessarily gradual, or are there genuine moments when the realizatio of something crucial hits you? How much of mathematical understanding is just matter of immitation and repitition?     

 + In <q>Poincaré on Understanding Mathematics</q>, Gerhard Heinzmann writes  
  > Now, since Aristotle, understanding is connected with learning. And it is well known that,
according to Poincaré, in order to teach and to learn mathematics there must be appeal to
intuition and reasoning by analogy1. The same capacities are also necessary to create new mathematics.

To what degree can we really relate understanding and learning even in the domain of pure mathematics?
