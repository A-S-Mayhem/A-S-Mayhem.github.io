Title: Product Shortage Risk in Car Sharing: An Experiment

Abstract

This is a marketing experiment conducted as part of the seminar for marketing on the University of Hamburg. Using survey data collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk and 
from university students, it is evaluated to what extent the availability of car sharing vehicles influences the readyness to choose this transportation option. The 
usage level and the similarity between users is varied in order to allow for variation in the availability and hence increase/decrease the percieved risk that an 
automobile will not be available when needed. The questionnaire was designed in SoSciSurvey in both english and german for participants coming from the US and Germany. 
The analysis was done in SPSS. The final presentation is in german.
