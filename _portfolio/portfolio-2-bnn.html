<p>
	Although this is ancient stuff in computer science terms, 
	the main paper still gets cited, so I continue to provide my old code and publications on the topic. 
</p>
<p>
	The <b><a href="../../files/NNRGBseg_forweb.zip">source code</a></b> is an implementation 
	of the algorithm designed to run on old NVIDIA (GPUs). 
	I haven't tried building it for quite some time. 
	It's based on the OpenCV library and NVIDIA CUDA framework. 
	There is in the archive VS9.0 project file which will allow you to build it, 
	once the correct paths to CUDA an OpenCV libraries are set.
