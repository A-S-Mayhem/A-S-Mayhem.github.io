I consider models of intra-cellular signalling in cell polarization, that
control how a cell determines its front and back. **The objective**
is to uncover how cell-cell interactions, intracellular signalling, forces, and
adhesion affect cell polarity and lead to the emergence of collective cell
behaviour, in small to large cell groups.

*My hybrid PDE-cell-based-models*, track 1D cells and their
concentrations of intra-cellular proteins (using reaction-diffusion equations
(RDEs)). The proteins Rac and Rho are known to regulate cell expansion and
contraction. In my model, their concentrations determine the forces on the cell
edges. Crucially my model accounts for single-cell experiment results.
