Children and young people with hearing loss are at risk, both socially and professionally. 'Open school' and some of the measures implemented in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic, such as outdoor schooling and digital school, make it extra challenging for children with hearing loss to keep up with school and develop socially, linguistically and academically.

The project 'Lyt Igen' has as its overall objective to develop, test and implement a method that will ensure optimal inclusion of children and young people with hearing loss (HT) in social and professional communities in a society, e.g. affected by Covid-19. The project's specific goals are: 1. To train children and young people with HT to navigate social and professional communities on their own 2. To give families, teachers, educators, speech-hearing consultants and others around the children and young people with HT, knowledge and tools to support social and professional inclusion.
