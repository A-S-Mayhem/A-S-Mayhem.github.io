In this project, I developed the communcation between Touch Haptic device and Cable robot using websockets.
Implemented the code for cable robot control using the haptic device with different velocity control algorithim.
working with Omron PLC to control each motor and its driver, and developing the codes required for sending commands and solving robot kinematics using GO lang programming language.
