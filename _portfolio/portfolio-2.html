In this lab project, I developed a communcation between Touch Haptic device and Cable robot using velocity control.
Implemented the code for cable robot control using the haptic device with different velocity.
working with PLC to control each motor and its driver, and developing the codes required for sending commands and solving robot kinematics using GO lang programming language.
