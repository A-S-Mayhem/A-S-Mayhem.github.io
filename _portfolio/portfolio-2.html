title: "Lineage Tracing Human B Cells in Vitro"
excerpt: "I used human B cells as a model to investigate a key question in developmental biology: during cell reprogramming, how do cells integrate extrinsic signals with their intrinsic cellular state? Using single-cell genoimcs, I was able to quantify the relative contribution of intrinsic cellular status. It was a strong effect, revealing that adding extrinsic factors like cytokines to cells is only part of the equation for reprogramming. These findings have important implications for long-standing goals of reprogramming or controlling cells for cell-based therapies and tissue engineering. \n <br/><img src='/images/lineage_tracing.png'>"
