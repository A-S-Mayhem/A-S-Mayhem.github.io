# Project Overview

This single-person course project involved the construction of a personalized custom haptic device entirely from scratch. Through a detailed analysis of the mechanism's motion principles and the integration with a virtual environment created using *Processing*, I successfully implemented various human-computer interaction functions. The project showcases the culmination of my efforts in designing and building the haptic device, allowing for an immersive and interactive experience. The meticulous attention to detail in both the mechanical and virtual aspects of the project has resulted in the seamless realization of haptic feedback within the virtual environment. This project stands as a testament to my technical skills and creativity, providing me with invaluable hands-on experience in the realm of human-computer interaction.

## Note of the corresponding course

The MAE-207-Haptic devise I took was taught by Professor Tania Morimoto. This course provides an introduction to the design and control of haptic systems, which provide tactile feedback to human users interacting with virtual environments and teleoperated robots. Topics include *haptic-focused mechatronic design, system modeling, and analysis (kinematics and dynamics), human-in-the-loop feedback control, and haptic feedback evaluation*.
