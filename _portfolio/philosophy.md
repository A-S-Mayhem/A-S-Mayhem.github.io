## Teaching Philosophy

>"I teach so, I can learn"
 "I learn so, I can teach"

I have been fascinated by the world of biology as a kid and the pursuit of philosophy of life has been a iridescent butterfly I have been chasing ever since. I have also had a crush for computers as I was growing up, always having a knack for fixing things or investigating how softwares worked under the hood. It was only after my higher education was I able to pursue a career path that involved investigating the world of biology through computers. As a person able to cross discipline-specific language barriers and understand both biological research and information technology I hope to bring my light of comprehension to a future cohort of students getting started in the field.

The purpose of education in my view is to facilitate the evolution of a student as an independent learner. Learning involves memory and students learn best in my experience when their short-term memory is not flooded with too much information but rather partially by providing strategies and exercises to help them form connections that will move concepts into long-term memory.


My workshops provide opportunities for skill development and active learning, while emphasizing the principles of universal design for learning:
- Formative assessment via google forms for every session of the workshop to provide timely and specific feedback
- Pair programming (involving teaming up with a peer to solve an exercise) to foster collaboration and community
- Based on the concept of 'sequential highlighting' a strategy for processing information, I provide worked programming examples that show a problem and detailed step-by-step solution, followed by a series of faded examples with small number of blanks to fill in
- Learning objectives that are specific and informative for both learners and instructors based on [Bloom's taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)


> “Our ability to reach unity in diversity will be the beauty and the test of our civilisation.”
― Mahatma Gandhi

As an international student having lived and interacted with students from all over the world, I personally have benefitted from engaging in diverse workplaces making me a better student, empathetic colleague and an engaged community member. Knowing that diverse teams are more productive, more profitable, and more innovative than their more homogeneous counterparts I commit to supporting the development of safe and brave spaces for students of Black, Indigenous, People of Color to organize and discuss issues surrounding race in STEM and data science.


My teaching philosophy has been enriched by engagement in various professional development opportunities listed below:

* [The Carpentries Instructor training (2018)](https://carpentries.org/instructors/)
* "Diversity Equity and Inclusion" course offered by Office of Instruction and Assessment, UArizona (currently taking)


**Teaching Practice**

Like all other skills, good teaching requires practice and feedback from peers. If you would like me to co-instruct a workshop or attend a workshop and give professional feedback on teaching, please feel free to write to me at sateeshp at email dot uarizona dot edu
