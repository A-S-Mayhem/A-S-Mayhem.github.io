excerpt: 'Literature has shown that racial, ethnic, and gender disparities exist among clinical research participants and within the ranks of academic institutions. To assess this and develop solutions to potential disparities in pediatric neuro-oncology, the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) and Children&apos;s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) working group distributed a survey to all members of the consortia regarding the state of DEI in our research environments. In parallel, the working group collated clinical data from a public CBTN dataset and a PNOC clinical trial patient cohort to assess racial, ethnic, and gender differences in clinical research participation and outcomes.'

Literature has shown that racial, ethnic, and gender disparities exist among clinical research participants and within the ranks of academic institutions. To assess this and develop solutions to potential disparities in pediatric neuro-oncology, the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) and Children&apos;s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) working group distributed a survey to all members of the consortia regarding the state of DEI in our research environments. In parallel, the working group collated clinical data from a public CBTN dataset and a PNOC clinical trial patient cohort to assess racial, ethnic, and gender differences in clinical research participation and outcomes.
