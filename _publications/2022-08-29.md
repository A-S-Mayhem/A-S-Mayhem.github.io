In this paper, we discuss how our work fills this timely research gap. Particularly, we investigate how to enable prescriptive analytics via ranking functions (called “BenchRank”). We present a research plan that builds on the state-of-the-art benchmarking efforts in the area of querying large RDF graphs. Finally, we present our research results of the proposed plan.
