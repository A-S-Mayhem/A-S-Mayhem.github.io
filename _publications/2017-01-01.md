collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-01-01
excerpt: 'Knowing the structure of nanoclusters is relevant to gaining insight into their properties for materials design. Computational studies predicting their structure should aim to reproduce experimental results. Here, barium oxide was chosen for its suitability for both computational structure prediction and experimental structure determination. An evolutionary algorithm implemented within the KLMC structure prediction package was employed to find the thermodynamically most stable structures of barium oxide nanoclusters. '

Knowing the structure of nanoclusters is relevant to gaining insight into their properties for materials design. Computational studies predicting their structure should aim to reproduce experimental results. Here, barium oxide was chosen for its suitability for both computational structure prediction and experimental structure determination.
