title: "Semantic Resource Management of Federated IoT Testbeds"

permalink: /publication/2017-09-14-semantic2017
excerpt: 'Testbeds and experimental network facilities accelerate the expansion of disruptive Internet services and support their evolution. The integration of IoT technologies in the context of Unmanned Vehicles (UxVs) and their deployment in federated, real–world testbeds introduce various challenging research issues. This paper presents the Semantic Aggregate Manager (SAM) that exploits semantic technologies for modeling and managing resources of federated IoT Testbeds. SAM introduces new semantics–based features tailored to the needs of IoT enabled UxVs, but on the same time allows the compatibility with existing legacy, “de facto” standardised protocols, currently utilized by multiple federated testbed management systems. The proposed framework is currently being deployed in order to be evaluated in real–world testbeds across several sites in Europe.'
