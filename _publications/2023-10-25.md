In this paper, we propose the ESPRESSO framework, which aims to enable individuals or applications to search Solid pods at a large scale while pod owners maintain control over access to their data. ESPRESSO considers access rights and caching needs while facilitating the performance of distributed queries. Our framework offers a vision for empowering search utilities in the decentralized Web, utilizing the Solid framework, and opens up new research directions for future decentralized search applications.
