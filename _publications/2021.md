title: "Compensation of Model Errors in Electrocardiographic Imaging Using Bayesian Estimation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/cinc2021
excerpt: 'In most studies, Bayesian Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation deals only with the measurement noise and ignores the forward model errors. We incorporated model uncertainty in the MAP formulation to improve the inverse reconstructions of epicardial potentials.'
