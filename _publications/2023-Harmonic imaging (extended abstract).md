excerpt: 'In  vibrator  technology,  the  presence  of  harmonics  is  a  common  phenomenon.  Several  authors  considered the problem of removing or utilizing harmonics from land vibrator data. However, marine vibrator (MV) harmonics are rarely discussed.  Although much weaker than the fundamental signal, we show that the MV harmonics can in principle be successfully used for broadening the frequency band of interest for subsurface imaging. Utilization is enabled by a highly reliable MV source capable of producing high-fidelity repeatable sweeps and by a high-fidelity source signature estimator. '

In  vibrator  technology,  the  presence  of  harmonics  is  a  common  phenomenon.  Several  authors  considered the problem of removing or utilizing harmonics from land vibrator data. However, marine vibrator (MV) harmonics are rarely discussed.  Although much weaker than the fundamental signal, we show that the MV harmonics can in principle be successfully used for broadening the frequency band of interest for subsurface imaging. Utilization is enabled by a highly reliable MV source capable of producing high-fidelity repeatable sweeps and by a high-fidelity source signature estimator.
