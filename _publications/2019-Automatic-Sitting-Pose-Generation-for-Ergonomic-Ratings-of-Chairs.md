Abstract: Human poses play a critical role in human-centric product design. Despite considerable researches on pose synthesis and pose-driven product design, most of them adopt the simple stick figure model that captures only skeletons rather than real body geometries and do not link human poses to the environment (e.g., chairs for sitting). This paper focuses on user-tailored ergonomic design and rating of chairs using scanned human geometries. Fully utilizing the anthropometric information of the human models, our method considers more ergonomic guidelines of chair design (such as pressure distribution and support intensity) and links the geometry of 3D chair models and human-to-chair interactions into the pose deformation constraints of the human avatars. The core of our method is a pose generation algorithm which rigs the user's successive poses through coarse- and fine-level pose deformations. We define a non-linear energy function with contact, collision, and joint limit terms, and solve it using a hill-climbing algorithm. The fitting results allow us to quantitatively evaluate the chair model in terms of various ergonomic criteria. Our method is flexible and effective and can be applied to users with varying body shapes and a wide range of chairs. Moreover, the proposed technique can be easily extended to other furniture, such as desk, bed, and cabinet. Extensive evaluations and a user study demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of the proposed virtual fitting method. Given that our method avoids tedious on-site trying, facilitates the exploration/evaluation of various chair products, and provides valuable feedback for the designers and manufacturers to deliver customized products, it is ideal for online shopping of chairs.
