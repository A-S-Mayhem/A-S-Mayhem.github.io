CorefQA casts the coreference resolution task into a span prediction problem akin to question answering. For each candidate mention, a query is constructed using its context to retrieve all coreferent spans. This design circumvents the limitations of traditional mention-pair models and allows for more precise modeling of context and span relationships. The method benefits from leveraging external QA datasets for pretraining, which improves generalization. CorefQA achieves new state-of-the-art F1 scores on CoNLL-2012 (83.1) and GAP (87.5) benchmarks.
