abstract: "In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an extended reality (XR)-based real-time medical practice education platform. This initiative aims to address the challenges in training medical professionals and to improve the curriculum of apprenticeship-style medical education. To minimize process delays during the operation of the XR-based platform, especially due to multiple client connections, we efficiently managed the data load within the server-client environment using RpcPun and script-based Prepap control. Our experimental results demonstrate that the platform can optimize processing delays caused by simultaneous multiple client connections, specifically during the execution of real-time medical practice content such as arterial blood gas analysis, blood transfusions, and blood culture tests on the XR-based medical contents."
