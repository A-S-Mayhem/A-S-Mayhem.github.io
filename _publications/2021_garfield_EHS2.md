excerpt: <blockquote>We hypothesize reputations for cultural group unity will be a context-independent universal, likely to manifest in all human societies, whereas reputations for social and material success, neural capital, and dominance are more likely to be context-dependent universals, promoted or suppressed by socio-ecological or cultural evolutionary processes.</blockquote>

This cross-cultural study includes exploratory analyses on the content, distribution and structure of reputation domain diversity, using the Human Relations Area Files ethnographic database and ethnographic documents from 153 cultures. Results are interpreted in reference to influential evolutionary social science models on reputation and cooperation. This article is part of the theme issue [The language of cooperation: reputation and honest signalling](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/toc/rstb/2021/376/1838).
