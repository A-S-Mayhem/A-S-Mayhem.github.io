title: "The content and structure of reputation domains across human societies: a view from the evolutionary social sciences"

permalink: /publication/2021_garfield_EHS2
excerpt: <blockquote>We extracted ethnographic accounts of individual-level reputation domains. Results suggest: (i) there is considerable cross- cultural variability in evidence for reputation domainsâ€” some domains are common in the ethnographic record (e.g. cultural conformity, prosociality) while others are relatively rare (e.g. teaching and honesty); (ii) evidence for most reputations are male-biased with male-specific reputation domains more variable than female-specific domains; and (iii) reputation domains cluster within six features: cultural group unity, dominance, neural capital, sexuality, social and material success, and supernatural healing.</blockquote>

This cross-cultural study uses the leadership data package to explore traits correlated with conflict resolution services among leaders across social and cultural contexts. Findings include that conflict resolution is more associated with kin group leaders than political group leaders.
