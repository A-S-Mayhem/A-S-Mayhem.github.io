#### Abstract

Increasing scholarships find that human rights affect policy approval by changing the strategic calculus about national interest. Can human rights rhetoric be more consequential in some international contexts than in others? This paper focus on an increasingly salient phenomenon that primes the strategic value of US human rights foreign policy: major powers' verbal criticism or endorsement of the human rights violation in a foreign country. I theorize that learning about how major powers respond invokes additional strategic concerns to citizens about the opportunity cost of US inaction. Utilizing a $2 \times 3 \times 2$ factorial design, I will test whether observing statements from other major world powers can increase the strategic value of the US shaming in the public's eyes, and whether the increased strategic stake increases the public's tolerance to potential costs of US human rights policy. The findings aim to join growing scholarly interests in the public's use of strategic criteria to evaluate the US human rights foreign policy. By demonstrating the priming effect of the third-party shaming, the paper renders new theoretical insight on when citizens are more likely to form human rights policy opinion on the basis of national interest. It also challenges the conventional wisdom's dyadic approach to human rights policy, and highlights the multilateral and interdependent nature of the international human rights shaming process.
