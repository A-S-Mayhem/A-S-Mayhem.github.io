#### Abstract

The absence of a standing punishment mechanism in the global human rights regime make interstate "naming and shaming‚Äù key to reinforcing universal human rights norms. Yet, the nature of international politics inherently corrupts the practice - states shame their adversaries more often than their friends. This paper studies domestic constraints to selectively shaming other countries based on national strategic interests. In this paper, I present a survey design that evaluates the salience of five event attributes in shaping mass preference about US shaming policy. Using moral foundations theory (MFT), a widely adopted psychological framework in foreign policy opinion, I explain how the target country's political system, the foreign victim's profile, and the way they are treated stimulate different morality modules, which in turn affects whether the public feel more or less obligation to support US engagement through shaming. The findings would indicate that certain event attributes are more powerful than other attributes in prompting public support for shaming. The findings would also identify the type of individuals that are more likely to respond to each event attribute. This research advances understandings about the role morality plays in foreign policy, human rights mobilization, and individual political attitudes.
