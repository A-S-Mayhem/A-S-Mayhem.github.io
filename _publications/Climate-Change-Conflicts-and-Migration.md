Situated in northeast Africa, Somalia endures both political and climate extremes. Violent groups like Al-Shabaab dominate parts of the country and it regularly experiences severe droughts. Understanding the effect of climate change on these already complex dynamics poses a significant challenge. Some studies of the potential impacts of climate change on conflict have found that increased temperatures or reduced rainfall can lead to armed conflict; however, this work challenges that view, arguing instead that armed conflict weakens the capacity of institutions and people to prepare and adapt to climate change.
