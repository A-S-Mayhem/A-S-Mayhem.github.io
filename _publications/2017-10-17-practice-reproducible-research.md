The Practice of Reproducible Research presents concrete examples of how researchers in the data-intensive sciences are working to improve the reproducibility of their research projects. In each of the thirty-one case studies in this volume, the author or team describes the workflow that they used to complete a real-world research project. Authors highlight how they utilized particular tools, ideas, and practices to support reproducibility, emphasizing the very practical how, rather than the why or what, of conducting reproducible research.

I wrote my own chapter, ["A Statistical Analysis of Salt and Mortality at the Level of Nations"](https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/case-studies/kottoboni.html), and collaborated on a chapter, ["Reproducible Applied Statistics: Is Tagging of Therapist-Patient Interactions Reliable?"](https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/case-studies/millmanOttoboniStark.html).
