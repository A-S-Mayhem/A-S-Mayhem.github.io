We present DeepDFA, a dataflow analysis-guided graph learning framework and embedding that uses program semantic features for vulnerability detection.
DeepDFA ranked first in recall, first in generalizing over unseen projects, and second in F1 among all the state-of-the-art models we experimented with. It is also the smallest model in terms of the number of parameters, and was trained in 9 minutes, 69x faster than the highest-performing baseline.
