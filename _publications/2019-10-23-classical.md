The classical simulation of quantum systems typically requires exponential re-sources.  Recently, the introduction of a machine learning-based wavefunctionansatz has led to the ability to solve the quantum many-body problem in regimesthat had previously been intractable for existing exact numerical methods. Here,we demonstrate the utility of the variational representation of quantum states basedon artificial neural networks for performing quantum optimization. We show em-pirically that this methodology achieves high approximation ratio solutions withpolynomial classical computing resources for a range of instances of the MaximumCut (MaxCut) problem whose solutions have been encoded into the ground state ofquantum many-body systems up to and including 256 qubits.
