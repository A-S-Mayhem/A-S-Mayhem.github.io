excerpt: "The impetus of the current work is to analyze the impact of simultaneously using the inventive high-voltage conductors and Nitrotherm spraying technique for maximizing the industrial painting process efficiency. This investigation employs high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results in deep learning models as an input dataset. A convolutional auto-encoder is used to reduce the computational cost with just 10% of the initial three-dimensional CFD Eulerian–Lagrangian computations, with a mean error of 1% on the prediction of the deposited droplet areas of the spray. The analysis revealed that by employing recurrent convolutional layers, superior capturing of the input pattern is obtained, which significantly aids the final prediction. <br/><img src='/images/POF2-TEST.png' style='width: 600px; height: auto;'>"

The impetus of the current three-dimensional Eulerian–Lagrangian work is to analyze the impact of simultaneously using the inventive high-voltage conductors and Nitrotherm spraying technique for maximizing the industrial painting process efficiency.
