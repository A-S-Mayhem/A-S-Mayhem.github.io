This book was started in the 80s by Bill Buxton, Bill Gaver and Sara Bly and recently completed and published.
Auditory Interfaces explores how human-computer interactions can be significantly enhanced through the improved use of the audio channel.

Providing historical, theoretical and practical perspectives, the book begins with an introductory overview, before presenting cutting-edge research with chapters on embodied music recognition, nonspeech audio, and user interfaces.

This book will be of interest to advanced students, researchers and professionals working in a range of fields, from audio sound systems, to human-computer interaction and computer science.
