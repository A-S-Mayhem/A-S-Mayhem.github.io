**Abstract**
the objective of the current study was to evaluate the interrelationship between the degree of genomic connectedness and genome-enabled PA by calculating connectedness statistics from either the joint use of additive and non-additive genomic relationship matrices or non-parametric relationship matrices using simulated and real data, further broadening the scope of genomic connectedness studies.
