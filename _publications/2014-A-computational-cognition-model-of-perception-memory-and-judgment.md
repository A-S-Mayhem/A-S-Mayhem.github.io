Abstract: The mechanism of human cognition and its computability provide an important theoretical foundation to intelligent computation of visual media. This paper focuses on the intelligent processing of massive data of visual media and its corresponding processes of perception, memory, and judgment in cognition. In particular, both the human cognitive mechanism and cognitive computability of visual media are investigated in this paper at the following three levels: neurophysiology, cognitive psychology, and computational modeling. A computational cognition model of Perception, Memory, and Judgment (PMJ model for short) is proposed, which consists of three stages and three pathways by integrating the cognitive mechanism and computability aspects in a unified framework. Finally, this paper illustrates the applications of the proposed PMJ model in five visual media research areas. As demonstrated by these applications, the PMJ model sheds some light on the intelligent processing of visual media, and it would be innovative for researchers to apply human cognitive mechanism to computer science.
