permalink: /publication/2021-08-01-acl21-harmfulness-detection
excerpt: 'This study explores the use of internet memes in social media, particularly their rise in conveying political and socio-cultural opinions. Harmful memes, often complex and satirical, have become a concern. The study introduces two tasks: detecting harmful memes and identifying their target (individual, organization, etc.). We present HarMeme, a dataset with COVID-19-related memes, and emphasize the importance of multimodal models for these tasks while acknowledging existing limitations and the need for more research.'

This study explores the use of internet memes in social media, particularly their rise in conveying political and socio-cultural opinions. Harmful memes, often complex and satirical, have become a concern. The study introduces two tasks: detecting harmful memes and identifying their target (individual, organization, etc.). We present HarMeme, a dataset with COVID-19-related memes, and emphasize the importance of multimodal models for these tasks while acknowledging existing limitations and the need for more research.
