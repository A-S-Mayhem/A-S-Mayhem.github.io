permalink: /publication/2024-Adapt.md
excerpt: 'Integrating adaptive learning model development into archival processing presents an
exciting opportunity to tackle challenges such as labor-intensive manual tasks, lack of
uniformity, and ineffective feedback integration. This pilot project explores the practical
application of adaptive learning models and natural language processing (NLP)
techniques to streamline archival workflows, improve data precision, and consistently
implement improved best practices and standards.'
