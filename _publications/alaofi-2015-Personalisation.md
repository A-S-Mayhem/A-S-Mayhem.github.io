excerpt: 'This research  explores  the  application  of  implicit  personalisation techniques  in  information retrieval  in  the context of  education.Motivated  by  the  large  and  ever-growing volumeof  resources  in  digital  libraries, coupled with students’ limited experience in searching for these resources,  particularly  in  translating  their information  needs intoqueries,  this  research  investigates  the  potential  of  incorporating  student enrolmentinformation,  that  is,  published  information  on  the  units/subjectsthey  are  enrolled  in,  to  identify students’learning needs and produce personalised search results. We propose, implement, and evaluate a personalisation approach that makes use of the collection of unitsa student is enrolled in to generate a student profileused to estimate the relevance of the library resources. To do this, we propose the use of a Final Relevance Score (FRS) measure, which assigns a relevance score for each  query-dependent resource  based  on  its  similarity  to  both the student  profile  and  the  submitted  query, with αparameter controlling the effect  of  both. To examine the effectiveness of this approach and whether it truly  produces  any  improvement  over  the  library  generic  approach,  this  approach  was  translated  into  an application called PersoLiband evaluated by a group of 16 students who were doing foundation units in the Masters of Information Technology course at Monash University.The  evaluation results  show  that thepersonalisation  approachsignificantly  outperformsthe  library  generic approach. This  shows  the  potential  of  incorporating  student enrolmentinformation  to  create  a  more effective  search  environment  inwhich students’ search results are not only driven by the submitted query, but also by the units they areenrolled in'
