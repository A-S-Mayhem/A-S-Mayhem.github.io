Abstract: This manuscript presents the updated version of the Neural
Network Verification (NNV) tool. NNV is a formal verification software
tool for deep learning models and cyber-physical systems with neural network
components. NNV was first introduced as a verification framework
for feedforward and convolutional neural networks, as well as for neural
network control systems. Since then, numerous works have made significant
improvements in the verification of new deep learning models, as
well as tackling some of the scalability issues that may arise when verifying
complex models. In this new version of NNV, we introduce verification
support for multiple deep learning models, including neural ordinary
differential equations, semantic segmentation networks and recurrent neural
networks, as well as a collection of reachability methods that aim to
reduce the computation cost of reachability analysis of complex neural networks.
We have also added direct support for standard input verification
formats in the community such as VNNLIB (verification properties), and
ONNX (neural networks) formats.We present a collection of experiments
in whichNNVverifies safety and robustness properties of feedforward, convolutional,
semantic segmentation and recurrent neural networks, as well
as neural ordinary differential equations and neural network control systems.
Furthermore,we demonstrate the capabilities ofNNVagainst a commercially
available product in a collection of benchmarks from control systems,
semantic segmentation, image classification, and time-series data.
