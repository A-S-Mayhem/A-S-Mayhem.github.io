abstract={The urgent need for safer batteries is leading research to all-solid-state lithium-based cells. To achieve energy density comparable to liquid electrolyte-based cells, ultrathin and lightweight solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity are desired. However, solid electrolytes with comparable thicknesses to commercial polymer electrolyte separators ({\textasciitilde}10{\thinspace}$\mu$m) used in liquid electrolytes remain challenging to make because of the increased risk of short-circuiting the battery. Here, we report on a polymer--polymer solid-state electrolyte design, demonstrated with an 8.6-$\mu$m-thick nanoporous polyimide (PI) film filled with polyethylene oxide/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PEO/LiTFSI) that can be used as a safe solid polymer electrolyte. The PI film is nonflammable and mechanically strong, preventing batteries from short-circuiting even after more than 1,000{\thinspace}h of cycling, and the vertical channels enhance the ionic conductivity (2.3{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−4{\thinspace}S{\thinspace}cm−1 at 30{\thinspace}{\textdegree}C) of the infused polymer electrolyte. All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries fabricated with PI/PEO/LiTFSI solid electrolyte show good cycling performance (200 cycles at C/2 rate) at 60{\thinspace}{\textdegree}C and withstand abuse tests such as bending, cutting and nail penetration.},
