  This paper presents a user interface designed for enabling computer cursor control through hand detection and gesture classification. A comprehensive hand dataset consisting of 6720 image samples was collected, covering four distinct classes: fist, palm, pointing to the left, and pointing to the right. The images were captured from 15 individuals in various settings, including simple backgrounds with varying perspectives and lighting conditions. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on this dataset to accurately predict labels for each captured image and assess their similarity. The system incorporates predefined commands for cursor movement, left-click, and right-click actions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves a remarkable accuracy of 91.88% and demonstrates its potential applicability across diverse backgrounds.
