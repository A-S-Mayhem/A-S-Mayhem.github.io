title: "Evidence for third-party mediation but not punishment in Mentawai justice"

excerpt: <blockquote>We found no evidence that third parties directly punished transgressors, such as by demanding that transgressors pay tulou or seizing resources from them after they refused to pay. Several researchers have argued that, even if third parties do not directly punish violations, they engage in second-order or indirect enforce- ment, such as by avoiding non-punishers as social partners. We did not find evidence of such higher-order or indirect sanctions.</blockquote>

This empirical field study is based on data collected by Singh among the Mentawai people of Siberut Island in Indonesia focused on traditional systems of justice based on <i>tulou</i>, a payment transferred from the offender to the victim, usually paid in local resources like pigs, chickens, durian trees, and sago. Drawing on this dataset of about 444 cases of wrongdoing we address a longstanding question in the social sciences: What is the role of third parties in sustaining cooperation, especially in small-scale, decentralized settings? Across hundreds of transgressions, we found no evidence of direct third-party punishment among the Mentawai. Victims and aggrieved parties demanded payment. If a transgressor was punished for failing to pay—if someone seized their iron cooking pots, for instance—that punishment was always imposed by victims and never by third parties.
