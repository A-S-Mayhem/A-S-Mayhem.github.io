Sparse code multiple access (SCMA), as one of the most promising candidate techniques for the fifth generation communications system, is a nonorthogonal multiple access scheme which can provide large scale connections. Its philosophy is to map coded bits directly to multidimensional sparse codewords, and the message passing algorithm (MPA) is utilized to detect the multiuser signals. However, the relatively high computation of MPA detection may lower the performance when SCMA is implemented in practical applications. The partial marginalization MPA (PM-MPA) helps to reduce the computation of original MPA detection. In this paper, an improved detection scheme based on PM-MPA is proposed. Our analysis and simulation shows that compared with PM-MPA, the improved PM-MPA (IPM-MPA) can obtain a lower bit error ratio. Besides, the simulation also shows that, to achieve the same performance, the IPM-MPA is less complex than PM-MPA.
