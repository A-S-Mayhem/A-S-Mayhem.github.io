Abstract: In recent decades, with the development of computer hardware, the technologies of render engines in computer graphics and deep learning in artificial intelligence evolve rapidly. Differentiable rendering is the bridge of the two technologies, which also develops rapidlyin recent years. Many methods of differentiable rendering are proposed and therefore provide new opportunities for next generation applications. In this survey paper, we first review the traditional render pipeline and then introduce the methods of differentiable rendering with both local illumination and global illumination. We list tools of differentiable rendering whosesource codes are publicly available. We also collect the applications of differentiable rendering including those concerning the 3D models of face, body, hand and free-from object. At last, we point out some future research directions on differentiable rendering techniques.
