abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a rich source of real-world data that can be utilized by healthcare providers and researchers for clinical decision-making. EHRs are only partially utilized due to the challenges associated with automated data extraction. Health information is available in both structured and unstructured formats. However, clinicians find it challenging to extract meaningful insights from unstructured data due to its complex and time-consuming nature. Natural language processing (NLP), a form of artificial intelligence (AI), has the potential to revolutionize patient care by providing more efficient and accurate data analysis. This research proposes an NLP machine-learning model that can generate clinically relevant synthetic data to assist clinicians in their practice. The results suggest that the NLP system is a promising approach for extracting valuable insights from the vast amounts of unstructured data in EHR.
