By adopting a new stress calibration method, a grating rosette moiré interferometry and incremental hole-drilling combined system is developed to determine the magnitud of the residual stress in aluminium plate subjected to a uniform uniaxial tensile load. Performing in-plane three-directional fringe analysis, the optical data contained in the moiré interferograms are converted into values of the strains in three directions corresponding to the grating rosette. The evaluation is carried out through the measurement of the in-plane displacement field in three directions generated by the introduction of the small incremental hole. The in-plane three-directional displacement fields are determined from the calculation of the optical in-plane three-directional phase distribution by means of a phase-shifting method. A new finite element calibration analysis that is general axisymmetric elements instead of 3-D block element and …
