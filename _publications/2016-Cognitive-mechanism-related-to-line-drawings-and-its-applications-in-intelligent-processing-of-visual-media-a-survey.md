Abstract: Line drawings, as a concise form, can be recognized by infants and even chimpanzees. Recently, how the visual system processes line-drawings attracts more and more attention from psychology, cognitive science and computer science. The neuroscientific studies revealed that line drawings generate similar neural actions as color photographs, which give insights on how to efficiently process big media data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on line drawing studies, including cognitive mechanism of visual perception, computational models in computer vision and intelligent process in diverse media applications. Major debates, challenges and solutions that have been addressed over the years are discussed. Finally some of the ensuing challenges in line drawing studies are outlined.
