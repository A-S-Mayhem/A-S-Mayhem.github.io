Preventing global warming requires overall cooperation. We show that decisions within small groups under high risk and stringent requirements toward success significantly raise the chances of coordinating to save the planet&apos;s climate. We discuss both deterministic dynamics in infinite populations, and stochastic dynamics in finite populations.&quot;
