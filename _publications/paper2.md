Recent advancements in textile industry have given rise to several spinning techniques, such as ring spinning, rotor spinning etc., which can be used to produce a wide variety of textile apparels so as to fulfil the end requirements of the customers. To achieve the best out of these processes, they should be utilized at their optimal parametric settings. However, in presence of multiple yarn characteristics which are often conflicting in nature, it becomes a challenging task for the spinning industry personnel to identify the best parametric mix which would simultaneously optimize all the responses. Hence, in this paper, the applicability of a new systematic approach in the form of multivariate quality loss function technique is explored for optimizing multiple quality characteristics of yarns while identifying the ideal settings of two spinning processes. It is observed that this approach performs well against the other multi-objective optimization techniques, such as desirability function, distance function and mean squared error methods. With slight modifications in the upper and lower specification limits of the considered quality characteristics, and constraints of the non-linear optimization problem, it can be successfully applied to other processes in textile industry to determine their optimal parametric settings.
