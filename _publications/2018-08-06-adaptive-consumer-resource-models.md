## Abstract
Competitive ecosystems are most commonly described mathematically using MacArthur's consumer-resource model, leading to the "Competitive Exclusion Principle" which limits the number of coexisting competing species to the number of available resources. Nevertheless, several empirical evidences &ndash; such as bacterial community cultures &ndash; show that this principle is violated in real ecosystems. Another experimental evidence involving microbial populations that cannot be explained in this framework is the existence of diauxic (or polyauxic) shifts in microbial growth curves. By introducing adaptive metabolic strategies whose dynamics tends to maximize species' relative fitness, we are able to explain both these empirical evidences. Moreover, we show that adaptation plays a fundamental role in how the species respond to external perturbations and volatile resources. Finally, we show that adaptation velocity is a crucial factor for determining the final state of the system.
