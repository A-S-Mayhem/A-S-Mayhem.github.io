title: "(4) Polar bear denning distribution in the Canadian Arctic"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-4
excerpt: 'Declines in Arctic sea ice associated with climate change have resulted in habitat loss for ice-adapted species, while facilitating increased human development at higher latitudes. Development increases land-use and shipping traffic, which can threaten ecologically and culturally important species. Female polar bears (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>) and cubs are susceptible to disturbance during denning; a better understanding of denning habitat distribution may aid management. We compiled existing location data on polar bear denning (n = 64 sources) in Canada between 1967 and 2018, including traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) studies, government and consultant reports, peer-reviewed scientific articles, and unpublished data acquired through data-sharing agreements. We synthesized these data to create a map of known denning locations. Most coastal regions in northern Canada supported denning, but large areas exist where denning is unreported. Gaps remain in the knowledge of polar bear denning in Canada and filling these will aid the conservation and management of polar bears in a changing Arctic. *This was a WWF-Canada funded project with the International Polar Bear Conservation Centre (Assiniboine Park Zoo)*'
