+ Propose and implement an efficient runtime system for accelerating GNN on GPU; 
+ The proposed system can effectively leverage the input-level information of GNNs for guiding system-level optimizations on GPUs;
+ Rigorous experiments and comparisons with existing GNN frameworks, such as DGL, demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.
