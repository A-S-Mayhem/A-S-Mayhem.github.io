We investigated program differencing tools and extend them to perform warning cascading automatically. Specifically, we used textual based diff tool, namely SCALe, abstract syntax tree (AST) based diff tool, namely GumTree, and control flow graph (CFG) based diff tool, namely Hydrogen. In our evaluation, we used 96 pairs of benchmark programs for which we know ground-truth bugs and fixes as well as 12 pairs of real-world open-source projects.
