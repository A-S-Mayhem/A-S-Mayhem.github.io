### Abstract
We construct explicitly a family of proper subgroups of the tame automorphism group of affine three-space (in any characteristic) that are generated by the affine subgroup and a nonaffine tame automorphism. One important corollary is the titular result that settles negatively the open question (in characteristic zero) of whether the affine subgroup is a maximal subgroup of the tame automorphism group. We also prove that all groups of this family have the structure of an amalgamated free product of the affine group and a finite group over their intersection.
