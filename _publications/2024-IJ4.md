abstract: "Fifth-generation (5G) mobile network is intended to facilitate high data rates with massive connectivity with the benefit of small cell technology. The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising mobile network architecture that can meet the ever-increasing resource demand of growing number of users. In C-RAN, the base station functionality is split into a baseband unit (BBU) and remote radio head (RRH); BBUs from multiple sites are centralized and virtualized utilizing cloud computing and virtualization techniques. However, resource allocation to the huge amount of dynamic users is a tremendous challenge to reach the objectives of system efficiency and meeting dynamic user requirements. In this paper, we present a scheme of allocating resources in C-RAN that combines centralized and multi-agent-based resource allocation. The centralized controller monitors and operates from inside the BBU pool, while the virtual base stations (VBSs) connected to the distributed RRHs act as agents in the multi-agent system (MAS). The ultimate resource allocation solution is derived from balancing between resources requested by MAS agents and resource demand approximation from historical data by the centralized controller. We conduct a simulation-based study to evaluate the performance of our proposed mechanism and compare with other resource allocation schemes."
