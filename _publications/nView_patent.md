excerpt: 'A technology for reconstructing an image of a three-dimensional object. In one example, a projection image dataset can be obtained from an imaging data detector and a reduced image dataset that has a lower quantity of data as compared to a quantity of data of the projection image dataset can be generated from the projection image dataset. An image remainder dataset can be generated to indicate an image difference between the projection image dataset and the reduced image dataset. A first scale image reconstruction of the three-dimensional object can be generated using the reconstruction technique and the reduced image dataset, and a second scale image reconstruction of the three-dimensional object can be generated using the iterative reconstruction technique and the image remainder dataset. In another example, a first scale image reconstruction of the three-dimensional object can be generated using a low-resolution reconstruction technique, and a second scale image reconstruction of the three-dimensional object can be generated by from an image dataset that compares the projection imaging dataset with the virtual projection of the first low-resolution reconstruction. A multi-scale image reconstruction of the three-dimensional object can be generated using a reconstruction technique and the first scale image reconstruction and the second scale image reconstruction.<br/><br/><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200090384A1/en">View Patent Here</a>'
