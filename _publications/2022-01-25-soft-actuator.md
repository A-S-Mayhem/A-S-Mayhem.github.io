As the team leader of a four-person team, I was actively involved in the development of the pneumatic soft haptic glove for immersive mixed-reality rehabilitation, as well as its corresponding hands-on demo. My contributions included proposing the initial idea, designing the pneumatic actuator, creating the circuit design, conducting mixed-reality tests to evaluate the effectiveness of the system, and planning and organizing the hands-on demonstration. Our research and demo were successfully presented at the IEEE World Haptics Conference.
