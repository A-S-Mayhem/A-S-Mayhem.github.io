title: "Resource-aware estimation and control for edge robotics: A set-based approach"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-01-07-resource2022
excerpt: 'The evolution of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and edge computing enables resource-constrained mobile robots to offload the computationally intensive localization algorithms. Naturally, utilizing the remote resources of an edge server to offload these tasks encounters the challenge of a joint co-design in communication, control, estimation, and computing infrastructure. We introduce a set-based estimation offloading framework, for the specific case of the navigation of a unicycle robot toward a target position. The robot is subject to modeling and measurement uncertainties, and the estimation set is calculated using overapproximation techniques that alleviate additional computations. A switching set-based control mechanism provides accurate navigation and triggers more precise estimation algorithms when needed. To guarantee the convergence of the system and optimize the utilization of remote resources …'
