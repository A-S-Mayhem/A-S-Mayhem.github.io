## Outline
* We reformulated the Bayesian inference in terms of the optimization problem and proposed the outlier-robust VI.
* In the paper, we compared the proposed method with recent Bayesian robust methods.
* The contribution of this paper is proposing the new VI problem and theoretical analysis using influence function.
