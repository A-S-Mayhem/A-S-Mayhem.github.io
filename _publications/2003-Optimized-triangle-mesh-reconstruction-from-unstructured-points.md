Abstract: A variety of approaches have been proposed for polygon mesh reconstruction from a set of unstructured sample points. Suffering from severe aliases at sharp features and having a large number of unnecessary faces, most resulting meshes need to be optimized using input sample points in a postprocess. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm to reconstruct high-quality meshes from sample data. The core of our proposed algorithm is a new mesh evaluation criterion which takes full advantage of the relation between the sample points and the reconstructed mesh. Based on our proposed evaluation criterion, we develop necessary operations to efficiently incorporate the functions of data preprocessing, isosurface polygonization, mesh optimization and mesh simplification into one simple algorithm, which can generate high-quality meshes from unstructured point clouds with time and space efficiency.
