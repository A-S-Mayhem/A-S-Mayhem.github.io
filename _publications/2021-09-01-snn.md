Based Cameras"

excerpt: 'Abstract. Optical flow can be leveraged in robotic systems
for obstacle detection where low latency solutions are critical
in highly dynamic settings. While event-based cameras have
changed the dominant paradigm of sending by encoding stimuli
into spike trails, offering low bandwidth and latency, events are
still processed with traditional convolutional networks in GPUs
defeating, thus, the promise of efficient low capacity low power
processing that inspired the design of event sensors. In this
work, we introduce a shallow spiking neural network for the
computation of optical flow consisting of Leaky Integrate and
Fire neurons.
Optical flow is predicted as the synthesis of motion orientation
selective channels. Learning is accomplished by Backpropapagation
Through Time. We present promising results
on events recorded in real “in the wild” scenes that has the
capability to use only a small fraction of the energy consumed
in CNNs deployed on GPUs.'
