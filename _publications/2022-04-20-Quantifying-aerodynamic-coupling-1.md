Non-tunable fluidic energy harvesters like piezoelectric cantilever beams harvest less power in turbulent flow than tunable harvesters. However, tandem beams improve power output due to aerodynamic coupling. We explores effect of beam configuration, length, gap-to-width ratio, flow velocity, and distance from grid on aerodynamic coupling-to-input ratio and electromechanical efficiency.
