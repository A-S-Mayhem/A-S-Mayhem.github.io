title: "Simulation of scalar transport in shallow waters using an unstructured grid model (in portuguse, only)"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2013-03-01-rbrh-1
excerpt: 'This paper presents an application of the model to the Guaíba River, including the region of the Jacuí River delta with its intricate network of channels and islands. Two methods for solving the transport equation were tested: one based on a central difference numerical scheme and another based on a high-resolution scheme.'
