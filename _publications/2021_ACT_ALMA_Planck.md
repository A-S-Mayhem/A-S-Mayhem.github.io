We aim to transfer Planck's absolute calibration based on the motional dipole induced by the satellite's orbit around the solar system barycenter to ALMA. Because Planck and ALMA were not observing at the same time and many of the compact sources used for the comparison are variable we use ACT data to "bridge" the gap between them.
