Abstract: Deep neural networks have emerged as a widely used and
effective means for tackling complex, real-world problems. However, a
major obstacle in applying them to safety-critical systems is the great difficulty
in providing formal guarantees about their behavior. We present
a novel, scalable, and efficient technique for verifying properties of deep
neural networks (or providing counter-examples). The technique is based
on the simplex method, extended to handle the non-convex Rectified
Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is a crucial ingredient
in many modern neural networks. The verification procedure tackles
neural networks as a whole, without making any simplifying assumptions.
We evaluated our technique on a prototype deep neural network
implementation of the next-generation airborne collision avoidance system
for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). Results show that our technique
can successfully prove properties of networks that are an order of magnitude
larger than the largest networks verified using existing methods.
