In this paper,
a geometry-based algorithm is presented which can find grasp
poses based on the geometry of the unknown object and propose
the ones which may lead to successful grasping. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm for unknown
object grasping can find a finite number of successful grasp poses
for different seen or unseen objects without using any random
point
