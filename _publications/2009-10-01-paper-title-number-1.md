Robot grasping is of paramount importance in
industrial and service robotics. In recent years, various data-
driven algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem of
grasp detection and a part of them are based on reinforcement
learning (RL) approaches. In a variety of proposed algorithms,
random key points are being employed which will make the
learning process inefficient and time-consuming. In this paper,
a geometry-based algorithm is presented which can find grasp
poses based on the geometry of the unknown object and propose
the ones which may lead to successful grasping. For the grasp
contacts computation part, the presented algorithm produces a
finite number of key points based on the 2D shape of the object
from a specific point of view. Afterward, it will narrow down
the candidate points and output a finite number of successful
grasp poses based on three grasp quality metrics for various
unknown objects. Three approaches are proposed in order to
achieve center points which can describe different parts of a
2D shape. Then, the obtained points are used as the center of
circles which are tangent to the 2D shape contour. Also, a new
grasp quality metric is proposed. The time of the grasp and the
amount of object disorientation after grasping are considered as
a metric to evaluate the successfulness of the grasp. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm for unknown
object grasping can find a finite number of successful grasp poses
for different seen or unseen objects without using any random
point.
