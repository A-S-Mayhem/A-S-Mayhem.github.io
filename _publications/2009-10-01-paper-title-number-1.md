##Outline
* We extended the Expectation Propagation method beyond the exponential families to t-exponential families preserving the analytical update equations.
* In the paper, experiments using Gaussian processes and Student-T processes show the usefulness of the method. 
* The biggest contribution of this work is introducing the novel tool called ‘Q-algebra’ developed in the statistical physics and applying it to the Bayesian inference method successfully.
