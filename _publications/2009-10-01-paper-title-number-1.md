title: "How Mass Immigration Affects Countries with Weak Economic Institutions: A Natural Experiment in Jordan"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'Saddam Hussein’s unexpected 1990 invasion of Kuwait forced 300, 000 Kuwaitis
of Palestinian descent to flee into Jordan. By 1991, this large exogenous population
shock increased Jordan’s population by about 10 percent. Jordanian law allowed these
refugees to work, live, and vote in Jordan immediately upon entry. The refugees did
not bring social capital that eroded Jordan’s institutions. On the contrary, we find that
Jordan’s economic institutions substantially improved in the decade after the refugees
arrived. Our empirical methodology employs difference-in-differences and the synthetic
control method, both of which indicate that the significant improvement in Jordanian
economic institutions would not have happened to the same extent without the influx
of refugees. Our case study indicates that the refugee surge was the main mechanism
by which Jordan’s economic institutions improved over this time.'
