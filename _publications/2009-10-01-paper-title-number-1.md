excerpt: 'With Peter Haan & Anna Hammerschmid
We quantify gender-specific differences in retirement
income in Germany, Denmark, and France. We show that the “gen-
der pension gap” in Germany is higher than in France and much
higher than in Denmark.
We also investigate gender-specific differences in health,
i.e. the so-called “gender health gap”, in the same age group.
Self-assessed general health in 2013 reveals no significant differ-
ences between men and women in the countries studied. However,
gender-specific differences in depressive symptoms follow a similar
pattern as the gender pension gap: Denmark has the lowest differ-
ence between the sexes.'
