Purpose
----
The purpose of this paper is thus to develop a hybrid decision-making model for optimal coal blending strategy. Coal is one of the major resources contributing to generation of electricity and anthropogenic carbon-dioxide emission. Being formed from dead plant matter, it undergoes a series of morphological changes from peat to lignite, and finally to anthracite. Because of non-uniform distribution of coal over the whole earth and continuous variation in its compositions, coals mined from different parts of the world have widely varying properties. Hence, it requires an ideal blending strategy such that the coking coal having the optimal combination of all of its properties can be used for maximum benefit to the steel making process.

Design/methodology/approach
----
In this paper, a multi-criteria decision-making approach is proposed while integrating preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE II and V) and geometrical analysis for interactive aid (GAIA) method to aid in formulating an optimal coal blending strategy. The optimal decision is arrived at while taking into account some practical implications associated with blending of coal, such as coal price from different reserves.

Findings
----
Different grades of coal are ranked from the best to the worst to find out the composition of constituent coals in the final blending process. Coals from the mines of two different geographical regions are considered here so as to prove the applicability of the proposed model. Adoption of this hybrid decision-making model would subsequently improve the performance of coal after blending and help in addressing some sustainability issues, like less pollution.

Originality/value
----
As this model takes into account the purchase price of coals from different reserves, it is always expected to provide more realistic solutions. Thus, it would be beneficial to deploy this decision-making model to different blending optimization problems in other spheres of a manufacturing industry. This model can further accommodate some more realistic criteria, such as availability of coal in different reserves as a topic of future research work.
