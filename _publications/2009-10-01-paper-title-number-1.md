excerpt: 'In this work, a consistent stabilized mixed finite element formulation for incom-pressible pseudoplastic fluid flows governed by the Sisko constitutive equation is mathematicallyanalysed. This formulation is constructed by adding least-squares of the governing equations andof the incompressibility constraint, with discontinuous pressure approximations, allowing the useof same order interpolations for the velocity and the pressure. Numerical results are presented toconfirm the mathematical stability analysis.'
