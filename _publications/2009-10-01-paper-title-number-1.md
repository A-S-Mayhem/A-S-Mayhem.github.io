**Highlights**

•A thorough and robust HSR classification and grading system is established.

•A data-driven embodied carbon benchmark establishment methodology is developed.

•Emission benchmarks of Chinese HSR at the subproject level are determined.

•Embodied carbon emission reduction technologies for HSR are highlighted.
