excerpt: 'Megaﬂoods cause widespread mobilization of sediments that have strong potential to control the geo-
dynamic evolution of the Namche Barwa (NB) massif by changing the landscape morphology within a
short time. However, the impact of catastrophic events on the denudation of the massif over the longer
time scale has not been explored in detail. This contribution assesses the impact of catastrophic ﬂoods on
the denudation style of the Namche Barwa (NB) massif over millennial time scales. Towards this, 21
optical ages and ~1700 detrital thermochronometric ages of zircon and apatite minerals extracted from
paleoﬂood sediments downstream of the massif, were integrated with decadal sediment load and
aggradation data to estimate the minimum denudation rate during paleoﬂood events. The results
indicate that the 7 ka ﬂood eroded ~71 m of material from the NB massif. This denudation is equivalent to
the material that would be produced over ~8000 years of erosion at a rate of ~9 mm/a. The 3.5 ka ﬂood
eroded ~24 m of material equaling ~2500 years worth of erosion at a rate of ~9 mm/a. Such relatively
instantaneous denudations are three orders of magnitude higher than averaged denudation rates over
million-year time scale. This study, therefore, provides the ﬁrst evidence of the strong interplay of
catastrophic ﬂood events and tectonics for the rapid exhumation of the Namche Barwa massif. Mega-
ﬂoods from the failure of dammed lakes provide valuable information to understand the ﬂood surge risk
for human settlements in the Siang and the Assam valleys.'
