I argue that the context in which countries implemented the income tax law was a critical juncture, promoting or undermining long-term economic and political development. When the implementation of the income tax reflected the foundational sectoral economic cleavage (rooted in the secular structural transformation), the tax expanded the overall state capacities, crystallizing a series of reforms that replaced the backwards institutional order, fostering long-term sectoral balanced economic growth. In turn, balanced growth promoted higher levels of sectoral equality precluding sectoral dominance of either political elite.
