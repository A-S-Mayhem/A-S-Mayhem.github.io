title: "Antineoplastic Agents. 599. Total Synthesis of Dolastatin 16"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper describes the total synthesis of dolastatin 16, a compound that had demonstrated extremely potent cytotoxicity when isolated from Dolabella auricularia, a sea slug. It was later found to likely be synthesized by Lyngbya majuscula, a cyanobacterial prolific producer of secondary metabolites.'
