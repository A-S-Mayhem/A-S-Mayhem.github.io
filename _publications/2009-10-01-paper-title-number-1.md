Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a traumatic-stressor related disorder developed by exposure to a traumatic or adverse environmental event that caused serious harm or injury. Structured interview is the only widely accepted clinical practice for PTSD diagnosis but suffers from several limitations including the stigma associated with the disease. Diagnosis of PTSD patients by analyzing speech signals has been investigated as an alternative since recent years, where speech signals are processed to extract frequency features and these features are then fed into a classification model for PTSD diagnosis. In this paper, we developed a deep belief network (DBN) model combined with a transfer learning (TL) strategy for PTSD diagnosis. We computed three categories of speech features and utilized the DBN model to fuse these features.
