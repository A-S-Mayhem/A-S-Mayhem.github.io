## Abstract

<p>For a connected graph <i>G</i>,we derive tight inequalities relating the smallestsignless Laplacian eigenvalue to the largest normalised Laplacian eigenvalue.We investigate how vectors yielding small values of the Rayleigh quotient forthe  signless  Laplacian  matrix  can  be  used  to  identify  bipartite  subgraphs.Our results are applied to some graphs with degree sequences approximatelyfollowing  a  power  law  distribution  with  exponent  value  2.1  (scale-free  net-works), and to a scale-free network arising from protein-protein interaction </p>
