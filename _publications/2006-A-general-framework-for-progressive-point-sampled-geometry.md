Abstract: Recently unstructured dense point sets have become a new representation of geometric shapes. In this paper we introduce a novel framework within which several usable error metrics are analyzed and the most basic properties of the progressive point-sampled geometry are characterized. Another distinct feature of the proposed framework is its compatibility with most previously proposed surface inference engines. Given the proposed framework, the performances of four representative well-reputed engines are studied and compared.
