title: "3D cross-Tucker approximation in FFT-based volume integral equation methods"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper8
excerpt: 'We present an algorithm for the compression of the Green function tensors arising from fft-based volume integral equation formulations. The algorithm is based on an 3D adaptive cross approximation of the Tucker decomposition. We demonstrate that the reported method can lead to remarkable compression (x2000) for a typical example involving interactions between electromagnetic waves and realistic human body model.'
