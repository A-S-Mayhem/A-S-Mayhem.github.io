This paper is about refactoring programs as a method of data augmentation. Intuitively, when we refactor programs, we can produce a program that looks quite different _syntactically_ because many tokens are changed, but is identical _semantically_ because the behavior does not change. We applied this technique and found that it is a useful and general method for improving the performance of deep learning-based vulnerability detection.
