excerpt: 'As the network infrastructure grows, its configuration and service provisioning become a tedious process. Accordingly, new paradigms have emerged, such as the Intent-Based Networking (IBN), that envision the automation of the network configuration, while minimizing the human intervention. Specifically, IBN allows users to interact with the network through high-level and declarative requests, called intents, which later can be translated into low-level configurations. IBN can entail different scopes and target network infrastructures, while being domain specific, which can create several challenges in terms of the final activation of the requested intents. To this end, in this paper, we mainly focus on intents that are expressing security and Quality of Service (QoS) network services demands that can be translated into Service Function Chains (SFC) and automatically deployed over a campus network. Our work and …'
