SDN network is a dynamic, controllable, cost-effective and adaptable system. It is suitable for communication networks with high bandwidth and high dynamic characteristics. Therefore, combining SDN ideas with the new generation of LEO satellite networks can achieve more flexible monitoring and management of the network, and can make the network expansion more convenient. Joint the Depth-First-Search (DFS) idea and Dijkstra algorithm for the huge numbers of LEO mobile satellite network based on SDN is proposed to improve the computational efficiency and the reliability of calculation result. Moreover, the communication performance of space-based network based on SDN and traditional space-based network is compared and analyzed. The simulation results show that the huge numbers of LEO mobile satellite network based on SDN breaks through the performance limitations of the traditional network architecture, and it can achieve better performance of the network.
