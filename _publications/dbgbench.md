title: "Where is the bug and how is it fixed? an experiment with practitioners"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/dbgbench
excerpt: 'This paper presents an observational human study and a benchmark called DBGBench.
DBGbench provides the correct fault locations, bug diagnoses, 
and software patches of 27 real errors in open-source C projects that were consolidated 
from hundreds of debugging sessions of professional software engineers. 
DBGBench serves as reality check for novel automated debugging and repair techniques.'
