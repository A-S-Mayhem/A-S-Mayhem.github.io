Abstract: Multimodal learning is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence, with applications spanning computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This paper presents the pioneering incorporation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into the Vision-and-Language domain, introducing MLP-Mixer as a unified backbone and adapting mixture of experts approach to effectively fuse different modalities. The Mixer is directly trained using surrogate gradients and has small timesteps. We propose a SNN specific adversarial training technique, combined with the mixture of experts framework, leads to improvements in adversarial robustness. We hope these findings will shed light on future research in the field of Multimodal Spiking Neural Network and adversarial robustness of Multimodal Learning.
