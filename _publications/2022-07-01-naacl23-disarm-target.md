excerpt: 'This paper addresses the misuse of internet memes for harmful purposes, particularly targeting individuals, communities, or society. We introduce DISARM, a framework that detects and classifies harmful meme targets using deep neural networks. DISARM outperforms other systems, reducing harmful target identification errors by up to 9%.'

This paper addresses the misuse of internet memes for harmful purposes, particularly targeting individuals, communities, or society. We introduce DISARM, a framework that detects and classifies harmful meme targets using deep neural networks. DISARM outperforms other systems, reducing harmful target identification errors by up to 9%.
