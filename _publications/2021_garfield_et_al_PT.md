excerpt: <blockquote>Using the eHRAF database, we extracted ethnographic accounts of individual-level reputation domains. Results suggest: (i) there is considerable cross- cultural variability in evidence for reputation domainsâ€” some domains are common in the ethnographic record (e.g. cul- tural conformity, prosociality) while others are relatively rare (e.g. teaching and honesty); (ii) evidence for most reputations are male-biased with male-specific reputation domains more vari- able than female-specific domains; and (iii) reputation domains cluster within six features: cultural group unity, dominance, neural capital, sexuality, social and material success, and supernatural healing.</blockquote>

This cross-cultural study includes exploratory analyses on the content, distribution and structure of reputation domain diversity, using the Human Relations Area Files ethnographic database and ethnographic documents from 153 cultures. Results are interpreted in reference to influential evolutionary social science models on reputation and cooperation. This article is part of the theme issue [The language of cooperation: reputation and honest signalling](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/toc/rstb/2021/376/1838).
