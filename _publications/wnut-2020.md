Abstract
======
This paper proposes an improved custom model for WNUT task 2: Identification of Informative COVID-19 English Tweet. We improve experiment with the effectiveness of fine-tuning methodologies for state-of-the-art language model RoBERTa. We make a preliminary instantiation of this formal model for the text classification approaches. With appropriate training techniques, our model is able to achieve 0.9218 F1-score on public validation set and the ensemble version settles at top 9 F1-score (0.9005) and top 2 Recall (0.9301) on private test set.
