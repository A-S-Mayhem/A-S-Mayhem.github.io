BGMN is proposed to address the challenges in answer selection by introducing an iterative and bi-directional attention mechanism that aggregates evidence from both question-to-answer and answer-to-question perspectives. At each iteration, the model updates memory representations using gated fusion to balance prior memory and newly aggregated content. Evaluated on SemEval-2015 and SNLI datasets, the model outperforms various baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant answers through focused contextual interactions and multi-hop reasoning.
