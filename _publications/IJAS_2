permalink: /publications/IJAS
excerpt: 'The objective of this study was to compare different genomic prediction models includes parametric and non-parametric, and assess their abilities toward a specific trait with only additive architecture. We hypothesize that with further exploration of predictive ability of GS models toward the purely genomic architectures, we will clearly find the true accuracy of genomic prediction models under a simple genetic architecture.
