## Outline
* We propose a new ensemble sampling method based on the non-reversible Markov chain technique. Then, we theoretically analyze the proposed sampling scheme in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance.
*  We find that the interaction causes a trade-off between a larger discretization error and faster convergence to the stationary distribution.
* We conduct numerical experiments to confirm that we can control the trade-off by tuning the interaction appropriately.
