collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-09-21-thesis2021
excerpt: 'In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, mobile devices possess powerful hardware and networking capabilities, however they still fall short when it comes to executing compute-intensive applications. Computation Offloading, ie, delegating resource consuming tasks to servers located at the Network Edge, contributes towards moving to a Mobile Cloud Computing paradigm, which will potentially assist towards alleviating the computational strain from the mobile devices. The motivation for this thesis is to deal with the inherent challenges of computational offloading, the most important of which is resource allocation under constraints, while guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) delivered to the users. Throughout this thesis, Control Theory concepts are leveraged as this domain offers a plethora of tools that can be utilised to tackle the emerging challenges. Additionally, concepts from Probability Theory are exploited as well. Specifically, in this work, an effort is made to address the following crucial research challenges in resource allocation and computational offloading: i) modeling the heterogeneous entities of the system (ie, the infrastructure, users, applications resources and the interactions among them), ii) estimating the workload that will be offloaded during a future time window (by predicting the mobile devices’ positions), iii) optimizing resource allocation by dynamically allocating (scaling) the available resources at the network edge while respecting the given constraints, eg, guaranteed execution of the estimated workload, delivering the expected QoS/QoE and minimizing energy consumption of the edge …'
