This work presents improvements and novel additions to the recent work on end-to-end optimized hierarchical bidirectional video compression to further advance the state of-the-art in learned video compression. As an improvement, we combine motion estimation and prediction modules and compress refined residual motion vectors for improved rate-distortion performance. As novel addition, we adapted the gain unit proposed for image compression to flexible-rate video compression.
