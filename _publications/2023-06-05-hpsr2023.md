excerpt: 'In the 5G/6G era of networking, computational offloading, i.e., the act of transferring resource-intensive computational tasks to separate external devices in the network proximity, constitutes a paradigm shift for mobile task execution on Edge Computing infrastructures. However, in order to provide firm Quality of Service (QoS) assurances for all the involved users, meticulous planning of the offloading decisions should be made, which potentially involves inter-site task transferring. In this paper, we consider a multi-user, multi-site Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure, where mobile devices (MDs) can offload their tasks to the available edge sites (ESs). Our goal is to minimize end-to-end delay and energy consumption, which constitute the sum cost of the considered system, and comply with the MDs’ application requirements. To this end, we introduce a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based …'
