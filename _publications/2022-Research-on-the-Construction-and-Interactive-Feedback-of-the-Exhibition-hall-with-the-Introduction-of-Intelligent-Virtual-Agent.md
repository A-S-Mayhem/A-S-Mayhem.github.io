Abstract: The Olympic heritage is the precious wealth of the world. The integration of technology, culture and art is crucial to the realization of diversified presentation and efficient dissemination of the heritage of the Beijing Winter Olympics. As an important form of digital museum, online exhibition-halls have a good foundation in the research of interactive technologies, but as far as we know, there is no systematic, intelligent, interactive and friendly Winter Olympics digital museum has been formed. We present an online exhibition-hall construction method with interactive feedback for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games. By constructing an interactive exhibition-hall with an intelligent virtual agent, we have further explored the role of interactive feedback in the dissemination of intangible cultural heritage in a knowledge dissemination digital museum. In order to explore the influence of audio-visual interactive feedback on the Olympic spirit culture dissemination in the exhibition hall, and at the same time improve the user experience, we conducted a user experiment with 32 participants. The results show that our exhibition hall constructed in this paper can greatly promote the dissemination of Olympic culture and spirit, and at the same time, the introduction of audio-visual interactive feedback in the exhibition hall can improve the user's perceptual control, thereby effectively improving the user experience.
