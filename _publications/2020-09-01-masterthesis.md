This report details an investigation into the applicability of Vector-Quantised Varia-tion Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) for representation learning.  The VQ-VAE’s represen-tations are investigated and a novel regularisation technique involving noisy vectorquantisation is introduced.  It is then shown, through a range of quantitative andqualitative experiments, that this regularisation technique forces the VQ-VAE to learnsuperior representations.  A theoretical explanation into why this is the case is alsoprovided.  In addition to this a new prior is fitted to the VQ-VAE latent space in theform of an adapted Progressive Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGAN)with self attention which yields a significant reduction in training and sampling time.
