Abstract: A majority of video summarization systems use linear representations, such as rectangular storyboards and timelines at linear scales. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear dynamic representation called SpiralTape that summarizes a video in a smooth spiral pattern. SpiralTape provides an unusual and fresh activity suitable for stimulating environments such as science and technology museums, in which children or young individuals can have enjoyable experiences that create meaningful learning outcomes. In addition, SpiralTape provides an uninterrupted overall structure of video content and takes design principles including compactness, continuity, efficient overview, and interactivity into consideration. A working SpiralTape system was developed and deployed in pilot applications and exhibitions. Elaborate user studies with evaluation benchmarks on multiple metrics were conducted to compare SpiralTape with two representative linear video summarization methods and a state-of-the-art radial video visualization. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and natural interaction performance of SpiralTape.
