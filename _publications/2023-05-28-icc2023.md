title: "Reinforcement learning-enabled auctions for self-healing in service function chaining"

permalink: /publication/2023-05-28-icc2023
excerpt: 'Service Function Chaining (SFC), defines the capability of interconnecting a number of ordered Service Functions (SFs) to create composite network services. A critical issue in SFC is the autonomic fault recovery, i.e., bringing the system back to its normal operation after a hardware or software failure. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel distributed methodology that treats the SFC Self-Healing problem in an Edge-Cloud infrastructure, while accounting for the various stakeholders. In particular, the individual SFC healing decisions are iteratively optimized and determined, while a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based SFC-to-datacenter association procedure is realized. This process is complemented by a combinatorial auction-based resource allocation mechanism that resolves the potential SFC collocations at the end of each iteration. The proper operation, effectiveness and efficiency of our …'
