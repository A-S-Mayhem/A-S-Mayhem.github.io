In this paper, we develop a novel framework for designing statistical hypothesis tests when given access to i.i.d. samples drawn under the hypothesis. In classical hypothesis testing, the uncertainty in the observed sample to be tested is modeled using probability distributions and then the rejection region for the null hypothesis is computed based on the distribution of the chosen test statistic. In contrast, here we model the uncertainty in the sample using uncertainty sets based on the Wasserstein distance with respect to the empirical distribution and design tests that maximally separate the two hypotheses using an affine combination of statistics by solving a \textsl{sample robust optimization} problem. The parameters of an optimal affine combination of statistics and the rejection region for the null hypothesis are the solutions of a sample robust optimization problem. Finally, we perform some computational experiments to compare the performance in terms of power of a test and robustness to distributional misspecification of our tests with other methods in literature.
