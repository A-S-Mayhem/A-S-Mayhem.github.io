My masters dissertation, written over the course of Hilary Term 2019. It introduces homotopy type theory and looks at doing _synthetic_ homotopy theory, focussing particularly on the theory of fibre bundles. The main result is the proof of a theorem originally due to Gottlieb about the homotopy groups of the space <script type="text/javascript"> katex.renderToString("Map(X, K(G,1))", {
    throwOnError: false
}) </script> of maps from a base space into the classifying space of a discrete group.
