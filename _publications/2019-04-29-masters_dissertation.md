My masters dissertation, written over the course of Hilary Term 2019. It introduces homotopy type theory and looks at doing _synthetic_ homotopy theory, focussing particularly on the theory of fibre bundles. The main result is the proof of a theorem originally due to Gottlieb about the homotopy groups of the space $Map(X, K(G,1))$ of maps from a base space $X$ into the classifying space of a discrete group $G$.
