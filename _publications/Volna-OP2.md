## Abstract 
In this paper, we present the VOLNA-OP2 tsunami model and implementation; a finite-volume non-linear shallow-water equation (NSWE) solver built on the OP2 domain-specific language (DSL) for unstructured mesh computations. VOLNA-OP2 is unique among tsunami solvers in its support for several high-performance computing platforms: central processing units (CPUs), the Intel Xeon Phi, and graphics processing units (GPUs). This is achieved in a way that the scientific code is kept separate from various parallel implementations, enabling easy maintainability. It has already been used in production for several years; here we discuss how it can be integrated into various workflows, such as a statistical emulator. The scalability of the code is demonstrated on three supercomputers, built with classical Xeon CPUs, the Intel Xeon Phi, and NVIDIA P100 GPUs. VOLNA-OP2 shows an ability to deliver productivity as well as performance and portability to its users across a number of platforms.
