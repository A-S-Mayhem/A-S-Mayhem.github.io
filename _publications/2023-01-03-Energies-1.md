This study introduces the development of a background-oriented Schlieren (BOS) system, used to explore the thermal effects and potential deicing capabilities of plasma actuators. These actuators are promising devices for dual flow control and deicing purposes, as they transfer momentum to the local airflow and induce significant thermal changes. However, their analysis has been limited due to considerable electromagnetic interference. For the first time, using the BOS system, we investigated the induced flow temperatures across plasma actuators with varied dielectric materials and thicknesses.
