excerpt: 'We present the results of the processing and imaging of marine vibrator (MV) alpha test data recently acquired at the Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea. The alpha test includes a 3D survey using a single MV across a frequency spectrum of 3-150Hz and additional testing of several 2D source-lines using two MVs. Moreover, two ultra-low frequency (ULF) test lines were conducted over a 1-8Hz frequency range. The preliminary processing results of the 3D survey are on par with those derived from the legacy airgun array acquisition, thereby affirming the viability of employing MV technology on a large scale.'

We present the results of the processing and imaging of marine vibrator (MV) alpha test data recently acquired at the Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea. The alpha test includes a 3D survey using a single MV across a frequency spectrum of 3-150Hz and additional testing of several 2D source-lines using two MVs. Moreover, two ultra-low frequency (ULF) test lines were conducted over a 1-8Hz frequency range. The preliminary processing results of the 3D survey are on par with those derived from the legacy airgun array acquisition, thereby affirming the viability of employing MV technology on a large scale.
