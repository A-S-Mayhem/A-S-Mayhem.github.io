**Abstract**
Computer programming is a complex task and a challenge for students who are starting to take an interest in it. Specifically, students in 
the first year of the Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science show certain difficulties in understanding programming concepts due to 
the high level of abstraction required for their learning. This process of learning programming can be facilitated by graphical 
representations that allow the student to establish analogies between the concepts it seeks to understand and other elements of the real 
world. The current literature proposes certain approaches that provide different alternatives to visualize programs and algorithms, either 
statically, showing their structure, or dynamically, showing their execution. Some of these approaches limit the potential of visualization
by focusing on showing the source code of programs over a virtual world; others try to explain specific concepts of programming in 
isolation, causing the student to lose the context of the entire program. This work introduces the proposal and evolution of a new set of 
graphic representations towards a 3D environment of augmented reality, based on the metaphor of roads and traffic signs, and which aims to 
facilitate the learning of programming to beginner students. The visualizations generated from these graphical representations can be 
constructed automatically thanks to their modular design and used by teachers in order to explain programming concepts during master 
classes. The proposal has been evaluated with students in order to validate whether the proposed notation is appropriate to represent the 
concepts it tries to abstract and easy for students to understand.
