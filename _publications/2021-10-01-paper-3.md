Abstract: We present NNrepair, a constraint-based technique for repairing neural network classifiers. The technique aims to fix the logic of the network at an intermediate layer or at the last layer. NNrepair first uses fault localization to find potentially faulty network parameters
(such as the weights) and then performs repair using constraint solving to apply small modifications to the parameters to remedy the defects.
We present novel strategies to enable precise yet efficient repair such as inferring correctness specifications to act as oracles for intermediate
layer repair, and generation of experts for each class. We demonstrate the technique in the context of three different scenarios: (1) Improving
the overall accuracy of a model, (2) Fixing security vulnerabilities caused by poisoning of training data and (3) Improving the robustness of
the network against adversarial attacks. Our evaluation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 models shows that NNrepair can improve the accuracy by
45.56% points on poisoned data and 10.40% points on adversarial data. NNrepair also provides small improvement in the overall accuracy of
models, without requiring new data or re-training.
