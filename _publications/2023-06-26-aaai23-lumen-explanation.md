collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-06-26-aaai23-lumen-explanation
excerpt: 'The paper discusses the importance of memes in social media marketing and introduces a task called EXCLAIM, which generates explanations for semantic roles in memes. We create a dataset, ExHVV, and a multi-task learning framework called LUMEN, which outperforms baselines in natural language generation. The study shows that cues for semantic roles in memes also help generate explanations effectively.'

The paper discusses the importance of memes in social media marketing and introduces a task called EXCLAIM, which generates explanations for semantic roles in memes. We create a dataset, ExHVV, and a multi-task learning framework called LUMEN, which outperforms baselines in natural language generation. The study shows that cues for semantic roles in memes also help generate explanations effectively.
