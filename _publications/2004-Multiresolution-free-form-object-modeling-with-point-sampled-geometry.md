Abstract: In this paper an efficient framework for the creation of 3D digital content with point sampled geometry is proposed. A new hierarchy of shape representations with three levels is adopted in this framework. Based on this new hierarchical shape representation, the proposed framework offers concise integration of various volumetric- and surface-based modeling techniques, such as Boolean operation, offset, blending, free-form deformation, parameterization and texture mapping, and thus simplifies the complete modeling process. Previously to achieve the same goal, several separated algorithms had to be used independently with inconsistent volumetric and surface representations of the free-form object. Both graphics and industrial applications are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.
