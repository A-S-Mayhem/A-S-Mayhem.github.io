Abstract: This article presents an easy, flexible and interactive tool for partitioning a 3D model, which is larger than a 3D printers working volume, into printable parts in an intuitive way. Our tool is based on the elegant partitioning optimization framework Chopper. Our tool aims at improving Chopper by providing users three easy-to-use interactive operations: no-go region painting, cutting plane specification and components reunion. With these operations, we show that (1) exhaustive search in the BSP tree-the most time-consuming step in Chopper-can be avoided, (2) more flexible geometric configurations can be provided, (3) users design intention is considered naturally and efficiently, and customized 3D partitioning results can be obtained. We test our tool on a wide range of 3D models and observe promising results. A preliminary user study also demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency.
