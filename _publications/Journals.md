A Categorical Quantum Toroidal Action On The Hilbert Schemes [Journal](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-institute-of-mathematics-of-jussieu/article/categorical-quantum-toroidal-action-on-the-hilbert-schemes/F2FF332BDEE1DA9F4A329293D4E8FAD9) [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11267)

It constructed a weak categorification of the quantum toroidal algebra action on the Grothendieck group of Hilbert schemes of points of algebraic surfaces.

On the K-Theoretic Hall Algebra of a Surface  [Journal](https://academic.oup.com/imrn/article-abstract/2021/6/4445/5868728?redirectedFrom=fulltext) [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00831)

It constructed a $K$-theoretic Hall algebra for the $0$-dimension coherent sheaves on an algebraic surface, proved its associativity, and gave a shuffle presentation.
