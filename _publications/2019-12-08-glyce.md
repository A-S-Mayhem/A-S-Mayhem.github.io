Glyce introduces a new paradigm for Chinese character representation by treating characters as images and modeling them with CNNs. The authors utilize a variety of historical scripts (e.g., bronzeware, seal, traditional) and propose the Tianzige-CNN architecture tailored to the structural layout of Chinese characters. A multi-task learning setup with image classification as an auxiliary task helps prevent overfitting. Glyce achieves state-of-the-art performance across numerous Chinese NLP tasks, including NER, POS tagging, text classification, dependency parsing, and semantic role labeling.
