excerpt: 'This study evaluated the use of multiomics data for classification accuracy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Three approaches were used and compared in terms of prediction accuracy:(1) whole-genome prediction (WGP) using SNP marker information only,(2) whole-methylome prediction (WMP) using methylation profiles only, and (3) whole-genome/methylome prediction (WGMP) with combining both omics layers.'

**Abstract**

Our results showed that multiomics data can be used to effectively predict the risk of RA and identify cases in early stages to prevent or alter disease progression via appropriate interventions.
