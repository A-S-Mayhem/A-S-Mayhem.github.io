## Abstract
In recent years, the localization and tracking of moving targets have been widely used in many applications, including indoor navigation, smart home, security monitoring, smart medical services, etc. The Radio-Frequency based contactless localization and tracking have attracted extensive attention from researchers. The IR-UWB based technology can achieve target localization and tracking at low cost and power consumption and has strong development potential. However, most of the existing works have the following problems: 1) Limited tracking scenes. Modeling and processing methods are only for outdoor or relatively empty indoor scenes under ideal conditions. 2) Limited movement state of the target. The target is required to move at a constant speed. 3) Low tracking accuracy caused by fake dynamic targets. In order to solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a moving target tracking method using IR-UWB signals on the basis of understanding the composition of the received signal spectrum in multipath environments. First, it extracts the dynamic components of the originally received signal spectrum. Then, it uses Gaussian blur-based multipath elimination and distance extraction algorithms to eliminate multipath interference and only retains one reflection information directly related to the moving target, thereby accurately obtaining the targetâ€™s distance curve. Subsequently, a multi-view joint fusion algorithm is proposed to fuse the distance information of the devices from different views to achieve accurate localization and tracking of a single freely moving target. In addition, we built a real-time moving target tracking system based on IR-UWB. The experimental results in the real indoor home scene show that the error between the center position of the human body estimated by the system and the real motion trajectory is always within 20cm. In the case of changing the experimental environment, experimenter, activity speed, equipment height, and other influencing factors, the system remains robust.
