In this research, we present a theory of finite deformation poroviscoelasticity. The proposed theory is based on the logarithmic strain and a quadratic free energy function. As an illustration, we apply the theory to the study of the consolidation of a finite porous layer. To show the viscous effect of solid skeleton, we compare the results obtained from poroviscoelasticity with those from poroelasticity. Moreover, we provide the finite element formulation for the one-dimensional problem considered, which can however, be extended straightforward for two- and three-dimensional problems.
