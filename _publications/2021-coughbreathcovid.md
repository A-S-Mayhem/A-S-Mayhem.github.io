Background: Since the emergence of COVID-19 in December 2019, multi-disciplinary research teams have wrestled with how best to control the pandemic in light of it's considerable physical, psychological and economic damage. Mass testing has been advocated as a potential remedy; however, mass testing using physical tests is a costly and hard-to-scale solution. 
Methods: This study demonstrates the feasibility of an alternative form of COVID-19 detection, harnessing digital technology through the use of audio biomarkers and deep learning. Specifically, we show that a deep neural network-based model can be trained to detect symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases using breath and cough audio recordings. 
Results: Our model, a custom convolutional neural network, demonstrates strong empirical performance on a dataset consisting of 355 crowdsourced participants, achieving a ROC-AUC of 0.846 on the task of COVID classification.
Conclusion: This study offers a proof-of-concept for diagnosing COVID-19 using cough and breath audio signals and motivates a comprehensive follow-up research study on a wider data sample, given the evident advantages of a low-cost, highly scalable digital COVID-19 diagnostic tool.
