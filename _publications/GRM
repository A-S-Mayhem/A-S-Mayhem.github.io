**Abstract**

We showed that the superiority of GK‐based model depends on the smoothing parameters (θ) so that with an optimum θ value, the GK‐based model statistically yielded better performance (higher predictive correlation, lowest MSE and unbiased estimates) and more stable correlations and heritability than the model with IBD, IBS or urn:x-wiley:09312668:media:jbg12467:jbg12467-math-0008 kinship matrices or any of the linear combinations.
