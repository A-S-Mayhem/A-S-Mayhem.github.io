#### Abstract
US Human Rights Shaming Data provides information about the US government's mentions on other countries' domestic human rights practice. The data covers dyadic shaming events between the US and 195 potential target countries, across 24 years (1997-2021) and 13 categories of issues. This paper argues that this data is a more valid and reliable measurement of bilateral shaming behavior than all other existing data, in three ways. First, it is the first data on governmental shaming as appears in official documents and speeches, avoiding the well documented bias of media coding. This paper also argues that the most commonly used data to measure international shaming behavior - multilateral shaming records at the UNHRC, OAS, and EU - is not apt for the theoretical question, and explain why my data avoids the problem. Second, it is the first data that goes beyond coding binary shaming event but measures the intensity of shaming language on a continuous numerical scale. Third, it is much more transparent. The validity and the reliability of the data is not only demonstrated by performance evaluation metrics, but also supported by thorough documentation on how the researcher's theoretical assumptions about the specific political text informs the preprocessing steps, supervised topic classification, and sentiment coding.
