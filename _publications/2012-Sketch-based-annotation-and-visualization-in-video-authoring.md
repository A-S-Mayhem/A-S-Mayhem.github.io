Abstract: Authoring context-aware, interactive video representation is usually a complex process. A user-friendly multimedia authoring environment is thus solicited to explore and express users' design ideas efficiently and naturally. In this paper we present a sketch-based two-layer representation, called scene structure graph (SSG), to facilitate the video authoring process. One layer in SSG uses sketches as a concise form with which the visualization of scene information is easily understood and the other layer uses a graph to represent and edit the narrative structure in the authoring process. With SSG, the authoring process works in two stages. In the first stage, various sketch forms such as symbols and hand-drawing illustrations are used as basic primitives to annotate the video clips and the hyperlinks encoding spatio-temporal relations are established in SSG. In the second stage, sketches in SSGs are modified and new SSG is composed for any particular authoring purpose. Three user studies are elaborated, showing that the SSG is user-friendly and can achieve a good balance between expressiveness of users' intent and ease of use for authoring of interactive video.
