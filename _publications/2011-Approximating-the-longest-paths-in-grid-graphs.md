Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of approximating the longest path in a grid graph that possesses a square-free 2-factor. By (1) analyzing several characteristics of four types of cross cells and (2) presenting three cycle-merging operations and one extension operation, we propose an algorithm that finds in an n-vertex grid graph G, a long path of length at least $\frac{5}{6} n + 2$. Our approximation algorithm runs in quadratic time. In addition to its theoretical value, our work has also an interesting application in image-guided maze generation.
