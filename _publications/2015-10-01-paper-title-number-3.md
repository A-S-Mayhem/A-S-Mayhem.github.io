• Implemented SadTalker (CVPR 2023) + GFP-GAN, a SOTA model for generating realistic talking head avatars, and deployed an API on the Modal Labs cloud-compute platform.
• This could animate 2D talking head videos from a single reference image as a part of invideo's AI suite.
• Tested multiple GAN/NeRF approaches for creating virtual head avatars.
• Worked on an internal tool called AI Labs Playground in Elixir + Phoenix for collectively deploying existing open-source models.
• Briefly worked on a POC AI card generator.
