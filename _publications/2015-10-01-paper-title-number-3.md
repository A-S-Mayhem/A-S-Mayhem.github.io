This paper aims to fill this timely research gap by proposing ranking criteria (called Bench-ranking) that provide prescriptive analytics via ranking functions. In particular, Bench-ranking starts by describing the current state-of-the-art single-dimensional ranking limitations. Next, we discuss the recent benchmarking requirements for sophisticated approaches over multi-dimensional ranking. Finally, we discuss the ranking criteria goodness by reviewing its conformance and coherence metrics. We validate Bench-ranking by conducting an empirical study using large RDF datasets under a relational BD engine, i.e., Apache Spark-SQL. The proposed ranking techniques provide the practitioners with clear insights to make an informed decision, especially with experimental trade-offs for such complex solution space.
