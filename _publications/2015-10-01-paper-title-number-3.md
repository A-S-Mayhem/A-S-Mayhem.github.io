excerpt: 'Deep learning techniques can predict cognitive intelligence from large datasets involving complex computations with activation functions. However, the prediction output needs verification for trust and reliability. Moreover, these algorithms suffer from the model's provenance to keep track of model updates and developments. Blockchain smart contracts provide a trustable ledger with consensus-based decisions that assure integrity and verifiability. In addition, the immutability feature of blockchain also supports the provenance of data that can help deep learning algorithms. Nevertheless, smart contract languages cannot predict due to the absence of floating-point operations required by activation functions of neural networks. In this paper, we derive a novel method using the Taylor series expansion to compute the floating-point equivalent output for activation functions. We train the deep learning model off-chain using a standard Python programming language. Moreover, we store models and predict on-chain with blockchain smart contracts to produce a trusted forecast. Our experiment and analysis achieved an accuracy (99%) similar to popular Keras Python library models for the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, any blockchain platform can reproduce the activation function using our derived method. Last but not least, other deep learning algorithms can reuse the mathematical model to predict on-chain.'
