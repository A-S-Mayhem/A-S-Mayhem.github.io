We present an S-band tunable loop gap resonator (LGR), which provides strong, homogeneous, and directionally uniform broadband microwave (MW) drive for nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensembles. With 42 dBm of input power, the composite device provides drive field amplitudes approaching 5 G over a circular area ≳50 mm<sup>2</sup> or cylindrical volume ≳250 mm<sup>3</sup>. The wide 80 MHz device bandwidth allows driving all NV Zeeman resonances for bias magnetic fields below 20 G. The device realizes percent-scale MW drive inhomogeneity; we measure a fractional root-mean-square inhomogeneity σrms = 1.6% and a peak-to-peak variation σpp = 3% over a circular area of 11 mm<sup>2</sup> and σrms = 3.2% and σpp = 10.5% over a larger 32 mm<sup>2</sup> circular area. We demonstrate incident MW power coupling to the LGR using two methodologies: a printed circuit board-fabricated exciter antenna for deployed compact bulk sensors and an inductive coupling coil suitable for microscope-style imaging. The inductive coupling coil allows for approximately 2π steradian combined optical access above and below the device, ideal for envisioned and existing NV imaging and bulk sensing applications.
