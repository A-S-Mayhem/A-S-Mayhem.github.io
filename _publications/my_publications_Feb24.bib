abstract = {Candida albicans is a commensal yeast present in the gut of most healthy individuals but with highly variable concentrations. However, little is known about the host factors that influence colonization densities. We investigated how microbiota, host lifestyle factors, and genetics could shape C. albicans intestinal carriage in 695 healthy individuals from the Milieu Int{\'{e}}rieur cohort. C. albicans intestinal carriage was detected in 82.9% of the subjects using quantitative PCR. Using linear mixed models and multiway-ANOVA, we explored C. albicans intestinal levels with regard to gut microbiota composition and lifestyle factors including diet. By analyzing shotgun metagenomics data and C. albicans qPCR data, we showed that Intestinimonas butyriciproducens was the only gut microbiota species whose relative abundance was negatively correlated with C. albicans concentration. Diet is also linked to C. albicans growth, with eating between meals and a low-sodium diet being associated with higher C. albicans levels. Furthermore, by Genome-Wide Association Study, we identified 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms suggestively associated with C. albicans colonization. In addition, we found that the intestinal levels of C. albicans might influence the host immune response, specifically in response to fungal challenge. We analyzed the transcriptional levels of 546 immune genes and the concentration of 13 cytokines after whole blood stimulation with C. albicans cells and showed positive associations between the extent of C. albicans intestinal levels and NLRP3 expression, as well as secreted IL-2 and CXCL5 concentrations. Taken together, these findings open the way for potential new interventional strategies to curb C. albicans intestinal overgrowth.},

abstract = { Introduction The FunHoMic project is a Marie Sk{\l}odowska-Curie Innovative Training Network comprising 13 PhD students, 8 academic partners and 3 industry partnersaimingto understand the interplay between fungi, hostsand microbiota to improve prevention and treatment of fungal infections. Importance About 2 billion people suffer fungal infections, which have a mortality rate close to that of malaria or breast cancer. Candida albicans has a high clinical and economic burden, making it of particular interest to the FunHoMic project. 70% of women experience at least one episode of vulvovaginal candidiasis (“thrush”) during their lifetime; 8% suffer recurring infections. C. albicans may live as a commensal but can cause symptoms when the fungus-host-microbiota equilibrium is disrupted. Infections by C. albicans have a significant clinical impact, with fatalities in severe cases. Many factors are associated with C. albicans infections; intensive care, neutropenic and diabetic patients are most at risk of systemic infection. Rising antifungal drug resistance has led to certain C. albicans infections having no treatment option. Aim The FunHoMic consortium combines projectson fungal pathogenesis, immunology, microbial ecology and'omics technologies to understand and exploit interactions between fungus, host and microbiota. Identification of novel bio markers on the fungal side such as genetic polymorphisms or on the host side such asmicrobiota profiles, metabolites and/or immune markers can lead to patient classification based on relative risk of infection. This could be the beginning of personalised management for fungal infections using preventive or therapeutic interventions like new antifungals, immune modulators or Live Biotherapeutic Products (LBPs). This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the MarieSklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 812969. },

@article{DEnfert2021,
abstract = {Candida albicans is a major fungal pathogen of humans. It exists as a commensal in the oral cavity, gut or genital tract of most individuals, constrained by the local microbiota, epithelial barriers and immune defences. Their perturbation can lead to fungal outgrowth and the development of mucosal infections such as oropharyngeal or vulvovaginal candidiasis, and patients with compromised immunity are susceptible to life-threatening systemic infections. The importance of the interplay between fungus, host and microbiota in driving the transition from C. albicans commensalism to pathogenicity is widely appreciated. However, the complexity of these interactions, and the significant impact of fungal, host and microbiota variability upon disease severity and outcome, are less well understood. Therefore, we summarise the features of the fungus that promote infection, and how genetic variation between clinical isolates influences pathogenicity. We discuss antifungal immunity, how this differs between mucosae, and how individual variation influences a person's susceptibility to infection. Also, we describe factors that influence the composition of gut, oral and vaginal microbiotas, and how these affect fungal colonisation and antifungal immunity. We argue that a detailed understanding of these variables, which underlie fungal-host-microbiota interactions, will present opportunities for directed antifungal therapies that benefit vulnerable patients.},
