collection: publications
permalink: /publication/1ES_paper
excerpt: 'This paper details the spectral evolution of the extreme changing-look AGN 1ES 1927+654 during its three year outburst beginning in 2018. We also present a soft reflection model called xillverTDE for a broad 1 keV feature in the early X-ray observations.'
