title: "Simulation of scalar transport in shallow waters using an unstructured grid model (in portuguese, only)"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'This paper presents an application of the model to the Guaí­ba River, including the region of the Jacuí­ River delta with its intricate network of channels and islands. Two methods for solving the transport equation were tested: one based on a central difference numerical scheme and another based on a high-resolution scheme.'
