We present a molecular dynamics study of radiation damage arising from nuclear collisions close to embedded yttria nanoparticles in a bcc Fe matrix. The model assumes a perfect body-centred cubic (bcc) iron matrix in which yttria nanoparticles are embedded as a simplified model of an oxide dispersion strengthened steel. It is shown how the nanoparticles interact with nearby initiated collision cascades, through cascade blocking and absorbing energy. Fe defects accumulate at the interface both directly from the ballistic collisions and also by attraction of defects generated close by. The nanoparticles generally remain intact during a radiation event and release absorbed energy over times longer than the ballistic phase of the collision cascade.
