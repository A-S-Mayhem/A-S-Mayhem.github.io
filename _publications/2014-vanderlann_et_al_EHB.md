excerpt: '"Critical problems in Barthes et al.’s article include: (1) tenuous empirical support for the tenets of their hypothesis, raising
doubt about its plausibility and the real-world applicability of their mathematical model, and (2) conceptual and methodological flaws associated with the ethnological analysis that limit confidence in their claim that the presence of MHP is associated with greater social stratification."'

This commentary article was a commentary response to Barthes, Godelle, and Raymond (2013, Evolution and Human Behavior, 34, 155–163), which proposed a hypothesis to (1) identify the process by which genes influencing male homosexual preference (MHP) are passed on over evolutionary time, and (2) account for why life-course persistent MHP is restricted to humans. We discuss criticisms that extend to many of the key conceptual and methodological aspects as well as much
of the factual information.
