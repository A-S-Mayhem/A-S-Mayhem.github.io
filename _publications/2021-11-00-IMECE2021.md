The stretch of interfacial flows due to the external application of an electric field has considerable importance in several applications. These range from engineering nanofibres to propulsion, the electrified jets bring us an outstanding technique to perform the emission of microdroplets. The present investigation concerns the resolution of interfacial electrohydrodynamic flows from a numerical standpoint using computational fluid dynamics. The reduced form of the Maxwell equations, for an electrostatic field, and a transport equation for the electric charges are coupled to the standard interFoam solvers on OpenFOAM, which resolves an immiscible two-phase flow. A laminar condition is assumed for the flow thus the laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes’s equations are used to compute the hydrodynamic behavior of the flow and, associated with them, electrically induced body forces are incorporated into the hydrodynamic momentum equation. The Maxwell Stress Tensor (MST) describes electrical surface forces acting on the liquid, making it possible to incorporate that effect on the momentum equation. A new efficient geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) method for general meshes, called isoAdvector, was implemented in OpenFOAM, as a substitute for the Multidimensional Universal Limiter for Explicit Solution (MULES).
