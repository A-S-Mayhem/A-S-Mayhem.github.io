excerpt: <blockquote>From a sample of 131 primary ethnographic and culturally unique documents we coded for evidence of norm violations within the domains of adultery, religious violation, food violation, rape and war cowardice, as well as evidence for reputational, physical, material and execution punishments. We discovered widespread evidence of adultery violations, moderate evidence for religious, food and rape violations, and minimal evidence for war cowardice as a norm violation. We also found evidence of physical, material and execution punishments in 38, 35 and 34% of societies respectively. Drawing on measures of socioecological variation from the SCCS we tested a series of hypotheses on cultural variation in evidence for punishment types. Accounting for the phylogenetic relationships among our cross-cultural sample, as well as correlations between evidence for punishment types, we found that egalitarianism (i.e. absence of social stratification) strongly predicted evidence for reputational punishments, whereas the presence of social stratification moderately predicted evidence for execution punishments.</blockquote>

This empirical field study is based on data collected by Singh among the Mentawai people of Siberut Island in Indonesia focused on traditional systems of justice based on <i>tulou</i>, a payment transferred from the offender to the victim, usually paid in local resources like pigs, chickens, durian trees, and sago. Drawing on this dataset of about 444 cases of wrongdoing we address a longstanding question in the social sciences: What is the role of third parties in sustaining cooperation, especially in small-scale, decentralized settings? Across hundreds of transgressions, we found no evidence of direct third-party punishment among the Mentawai. Victims and aggrieved parties demanded payment. If a transgressor was punished for failing to pay—if someone seized their iron cooking pots, for instance—that punishment was always imposed by victims and never by third parties.
