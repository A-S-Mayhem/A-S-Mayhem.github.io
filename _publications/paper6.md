excerpt: 'We simulated a Global Maxwell Tomography experiment for the estimation of electrical properties in a numerical tissue-mimicking phantom using a decoupled 8 channel radiofrequency coil designed for 7 Tesla magnetic resonance scanners. The goal of this work was to investigate whether the orthogonality of the coil's transmit fields (b_1^+ measurements) is required to ensure accurate results. We demonstrated a normalized root mean squared error smaller than 0.6% with respect to the true electrical properties distribution. Our results showed that electrical properties reconstruction with Global Maxwell Tomography is accurate and robust.'
