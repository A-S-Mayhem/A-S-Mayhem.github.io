Non-resonant harvesters like piezoelectric cantilever beams are less viable than resonant counterparts for extracting energy from turbulence-induced vibration. Positioning such harvesters side-by-side and using aerodynamic coupling can improve power output. Our study derives power budget and electromechanical efficiency of two side-by-side beams in quiescent flow. Data in grid-generated turbulence is discussed but drive deeper in the next paper.
