My first published work during my Masters at Purdue University. We presented a principle agent model of a one-shot, shallow systems engineering process, assuming that all agents are risk neutral and, thus, they maximize their expected payoff. Using a spacecraft design case study, we demonstrated how the parameters of our model can be estimated from historical data.
