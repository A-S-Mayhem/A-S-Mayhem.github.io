[See my talk from UseR! 2016 on the corresponding R package.](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Wednesday-June-29--1048am-1106am)

`permute` provides permutation tests for a variety of common hypothesis testing problems. 
Permutation tests require only minimal distributional assumptions about the data and guarantee correct type I error rates. 
Our goal is to enable researchers to enable researchers to reason about what nonparametric tests are suitable for their experimental design and to effectively implement these tests in Python. 
`permute` is available on [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/permute/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/statlab/permute/).
