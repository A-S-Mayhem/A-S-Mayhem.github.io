title: "Benefit of selfstabilizing protocols in eventually consistent key-value stores: a case study"
#collection: publications
permalink: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3288599.3288609
excerpt: 'In this paper, we investigated the benefit of self-stabilization in recovering faults caused by consistency violation faults. When a key-value store employs a weak consistency model (e.g. eventual consistency), the data at different replicas could be inconsistent. Application reading inconsistent data could execute incorrect computation transitions. Such incorrect transitions are denoted as consistency violation faults.'

In this paper, we investigated the benefit of self-stabilization in recovering faults caused by consistency violation faults. When a key-value store employs a weak consistency model (e.g. eventual consistency), the data at different replicas could be inconsistent. Application reading inconsistent data could execute incorrect computation transitions. Such incorrect transitions are denoted as consistency violation faults.
