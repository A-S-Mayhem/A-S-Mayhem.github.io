title: "Evidence for a travel direction signal in humans that is independent of head direction"

excerpt: 'We often assume that travel direction is redundant with head direction, but from first principles these two factors provide differing spatial information. Although head direction has been found to be a fundamental component of human navigation, it is unclear how self-motion signals for travel direction contribute to forming a travel trajectory. Employing a novel motion adaptation paradigm from visual neuroscience designed to preclude a contribution of head direction, we found high-level aftereffects of perceived travel direction, indicating that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation.'

We often assume that travel direction is redundant with head direction, but from first principles these two factors provide differing spatial information. Although head direction has been found to be a fundamental component of human navigation, it is unclear how self-motion signals for travel direction contribute to forming a travel trajectory. Employing a novel motion adaptation paradigm from visual neuroscience designed to preclude a contribution of head direction, we found high-level aftereffects of perceived travel direction, indicating that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation. Interestingly, we discovered a higher frequency of reporting perceived travel toward the adapted direction compared to a no-adapt control â€“ an aftereffect that runs contrary to low-level motion aftereffects. This travel aftereffect was maintained after controlling for possible response biases and approaching effects, and it scaled with adaptation duration. These findings demonstrate the first evidence of how a pure travel direction signal might be represented in humans, independent of head direction.
