## Abstract
This paper explores the modeling and exploitation of semi-local similarity in natural images to address the ill-posed nature of image interpolation. Our approach distinguishes itself from prior approaches by direct and careful use of semi-local similar patches to interpolate each individual patch. Our work uses a simple, parallelizable algorithm without the need to solve complicated optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our interpolated images achieve significantly higher objective and subjective quality compared with those from state-of-the-art algorithms.
