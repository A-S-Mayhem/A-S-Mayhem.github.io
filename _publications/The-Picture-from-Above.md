Overview <br />

Extreme and uncertain climate conditions adversely affect people around the world, including,
in extreme circumstances, by displacing them from their homes. In todayâ€™s global climate crisis, it
is critical to have a range of tools available to measure and address the scale and drivers of such
forced migration. Inclusive development and the provision of time-effective humanitarian aid to those
displaced requires real-time information on displacement, information that can be difficult to fully obtain
through data collection on the ground. Satellite data offers an opportunity to supplement ground-level
data collection for targeted intervention in areas most at-risk of displacement. The starting point of
this paper is the discourse on environmental displacement, the challenges of studying this type of
displacement and the opportunities information from remote sensing provide. We then showcase the
applicability of such data in an embedded case study on Somalia, a country with a longstanding history
of forced migration, drought and conflict.
