Abstract: Spatial ability is a category of human reasoning skills that plays an important role in affecting a person's development in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Spatial ability has been demonstrated to be malleable and can be improved through training. In this paper, we present a training scheme by tangible interaction with a reconfigurable robot called EasySRRobot. A preliminary user study based on behavioral and EEG data analysis shows that via interaction with EasySRRobot, users can significantly improve their performance on a task related to spatial ability.
