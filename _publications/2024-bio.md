Purpose

We evaluated T- and B-cell receptor (TCR and BCR) repertoire diversity and 38 serum cytokines in pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood of 66 patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus durvalumab and assessed associations with pathologic response and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) during treatment.

Methods

Genomic DNA was isolated from buffy coat for TCR and BCR clonotype profiling using the Immunoseq platform and diversity was quantified with Pielou’s evenness index. MILLIPLEX MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel was used to measure serum cytokine levels, which were compared between groups using moderated t-statistic with Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple testing.

Results

TCR and BCR diversity was high (Pielou’s index > 0.75) in all samples. Baseline receptor diversities and change in diversity pre- and post-treatment were not associated with pathologic response or irAE status, except for BCR diversity that was significantly lower post-treatment in patients who developed irAE (unadjusted p = 0.0321). Five cytokines increased after treatment in patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) but decreased in patients with RD, most prominently IL-8. IFNγ, IL-7, and GM-CSF levels were higher in pre-treatment than in post-treatment samples of patients who developed irAEs but were lower in those without irAEs.

Conclusion

Baseline peripheral blood cytokine levels may predict irAEs in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy, and increased post-treatment B-cell clonal expansion might mediate irAEs.
