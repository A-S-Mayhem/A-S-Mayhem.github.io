Abstract: Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is considered more biologically realistic and power-efficient as it imitates the fundamental mechanism of the human brain. Recently, backpropagation (BP) based SNN learning algorithms that utilize deep learning frameworks have achieved good performance. However, bio-interpretability is partially
neglected in those BP-based algorithms. Toward bio-plausible BP-based SNNs, we consider three properties in modeling spike activities: Multiplicity, Adaptability, and Plasticity (MAP). In terms of multiplicity, we propose a Multiple-Spike Pattern (MSP) with multiple spike transmission to strengthen model robustness in discrete time iteration. To realize adaptability, we adopt Spike Frequency Adaption (SFA) under MSP to decrease spike activities for improved efficiency. For plasticity, we propose a trainable convolutional synapse that models spike response current to enhance the diversity of spiking neurons for temporal feature extraction. The proposed SNN model achieves competitive performances on neuromorphic datasets: N-MNIST and SHD. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed three aspects are significant to iterative robustness, spike efficiency, and temporal feature extraction capability of spike activities. In summary, this work proposes a feasible scheme for bio-inspired spike activities with MAP, offering a new neuromorphic perspective to embed biological characteristics into spiking neural networks.
