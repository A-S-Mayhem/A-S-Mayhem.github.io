**Abstract**

The objective of this study was to infer genetic and genomic correlations between three traits measured in broilers by exploring linear combinations of pedigree-based (genealogical) and marker-based relationship matrices. A predictive approach was used to gauge parameter estimates and to provide an empirical test of the extent of genetic association between traits.
