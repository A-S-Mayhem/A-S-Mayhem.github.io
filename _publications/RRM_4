excerpt: 'However, given the capability of HTP to collect multiple temporal phenotypes, one unresolved question in plant breeding is how to jointly model multiple temporal phenotypes. To
address this, we aimed to integrate the RRM framework for temporal traits into a MT model.'

**Abstract**

We confirmed that MT-RRM frameworks provide an effective approach to predict temporal physiological traits that are difficult or expensive to quantify in large populations.
