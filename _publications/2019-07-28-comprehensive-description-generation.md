This paper proposes a dual-method approach to improve the generation of comprehensive descriptions from attribute-value tables. The force-attention mechanism directs the model to cover all key attributes by monitoring attention distributions, while reinforcement learning encourages richness and discourages hallucinations. The authors introduce WB-filter, a filtered subset of WIKIBIO, to simulate user-oriented generation. The model achieves state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations, significantly mitigating issues like missing key facts and generating unsupported claims.
