excerpt: "This paper explores the integration of computational thinking (CT)
in non-STEM fields, emphasizing its relevance beyond traditional
STEM education. We present findings from a Delphi study involv-
ing experts in Social Studies studies education, highlighting design
principles for incorporating CT into the discipline. Our study builds
on the foundational ideas of CT as a problem-solving approach
and, based on expert perspectives on current needs and opportuni-
ties within Social Studies, situated the particular affordances and
epistemic practices of CT in social studies instruction that enhance
and extend disciplinary learning. Results from our work led to
three overarching instructional pathways to provide social studies
teachers with opportunities to integrate CT within their instruc-
tion: 1) Support students to create models and representations in
social studies; 2) Support students to engage in data practices for
social studies inquiry; 3) Support students to understand comput-
ingâ€™s impact on society. The paper elaborates on these instructional
pathways by including associated sub-practices and examples of
what each looks like in practice. These instructional pathways offer
valuable insights for curriculum development and teacher profes-
sional learning, supporting the broader application of CT in K-12
education."
