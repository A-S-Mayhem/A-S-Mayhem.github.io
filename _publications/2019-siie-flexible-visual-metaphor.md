**Abstract**
Programming learning has been a research topic for more than 25 years. From its beginning, it has been demonstrated that its difficulty is 
due to the high level of abstraction which certain programming concepts are required by students. However, this level of abstraction may be 
reduced by using graphic representations which pretend to capture and maintain user’s attention and motivation, as well as to facilitate 
their understanding associating real-world elements with specific programming terms. Therefore, this paper shows the ANGELA notation, a 
metaphor of roads and traffic signs used to visualize dynamically the execution of a program with a vehicle traveling through its structure 
executing statements. Such visualizations may be executed in a variety of environments, which support different interaction mechanisms 
depending on the graphic representations dimensionality. Additionally, this work highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the 
proposal through its application in different use cases, together with a methodology we have selected as an example to show how the 
notation could be exploited in a real-learning scenario.
