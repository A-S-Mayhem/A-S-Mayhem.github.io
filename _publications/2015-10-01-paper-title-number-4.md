excerpt: 'This paper presents a novel approach to securing IoT devices by leveraging DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) architecture on a Blockchain framework. Like many areas of the information technology domain, IoT sensors are also prone to attacks but on a larger scale. There are millions of devices being connected to a central domain to provide different types of services. Since these low-powered IoT devices have constrained technical requirements with less computational capabilities, they lack the capacity to judge their behavior as benign or malignant. IoT relies heavily on the higher level of intelligent nodes to decide on their status. An IoT Controller/Edge server handles the registration and the limited management of devices. Since traditional security is unable to protect the IoT environment sufficiently, we present a Blockchain-based DDoS detection approach to secure and mitigate such attacks in the IoT environment. Our test setup includes dataset from four sensors over two months. These values were tested using a threshold calculation against the variation of temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind direction on that day to find out whether an IoT sensor is under a DDoS attack. Our results show how DOTS can help in detection of attack when mapped on IoT edge computing.'
