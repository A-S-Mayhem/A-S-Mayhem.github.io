excerpt: 'Changes in the relative performance of genotypes (sires) across different environments, which are referred to as genotype–environment interactions, play an important role in dairy production systems, especially in countries that rely on imported genetic material. Importance of genotype by environment interaction on genetic analysis of milk yield was investigated in Holstein cows by using random regression model.'

**Abstract**
Importance of genotype by environment interaction on genetic analysis of milk yield was investigated in Holstein cows by using random regression model. In total, 68 945 milk test-day records of first, second and third lactations of 8515 animals that originated from 100 sires and 7743 dams in 34 herds, collected by the Iranian animal breeding centre during 2007–2009, were used.
