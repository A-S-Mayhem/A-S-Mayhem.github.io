Abstract: Animating a single face photo is an important research topic which receives considerable attention in computer vision and graphics. Yet line drawings for face portraits, which is a longstanding and popular art form, have not been explored much in this area. Simply concatenating a realistic talking face video generation model with a photo-to-drawing style transfer module suffers from severe inter-frame discontinuity issues. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to generate artistic talking portrait-line-drawing video, given a single face photo and a speech signal. After predicting facial landmark movements from the input speech signal, we propose a novel GAN model to simultaneously handle domain transfer (from photo to drawing) and facial geometry change (according to the predicted facial landmarks). To address the inter-frame discontinuity issues, we propose two novel temporal coherence losses: one based on warping and the other based on a temporal coherence discriminator. Experiments show that our model produces high quality artistic talking portrait-line-drawing videos and outperforms baseline methods. We also show our method can be easily extended to other artistic styles and generate good results.
