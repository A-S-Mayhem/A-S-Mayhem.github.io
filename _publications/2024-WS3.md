abstract: "In this paper, we design and implement an Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor-based healthcare monitoring system for real-time measurement and analysis of imbalanced plantar pressure. The designed IoT monitoring system is constituted based on cost-effective computing devices, namely Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno. In this setup, each Arduino and Raspberry Pi device processes the values from plantar pressure sensors and utilizes them for visualization, respectively. Furthermore, to achieve precise measurements of the imbalanced plantar pressure, we compare and analyze the accuracy between the load cell and thin-film pressure sensors. Our experimental results reveal that the load cell sensors achieve approximately 34.17% higher accuracy compared to thin-film sensors. Future research, building on these findings, will explore the development of IoT-based smart pedal technology for indoor bicycles, aimed at healthcare applications."
