excerpt: <blockquote>Henrich's view of religions as distinct, formal social institutions represents only some of the evidence on “religions” across cultures. Knowledge specialists who help clients are widespread in the ethnographic record. Their practical services can be misconstrued as religious rituals, and their abstract explanations as doctrinal beliefs in the supernatural..</blockquote>

This commentary on Joseph Henrich's <i>The WEIRDest People in the World</i> discusses our extensive investigations of the ethnographic literature on the roles and functions of leaders and knowledge specialists across cultures, which speak to ongoing discussions on the evolutionary origins of religion. We critically discuss Henrich's account of religions, we propose our own view, which is complementary to Henrich's account in some cases, and to the alternative “wild religions” perspective in others -- the key distinction, we argue, is that Henrich's model applies mostly to common, everyday problems, such as subsistence and collective actions, whereas the “wild religions” model applies mostly to rare and uncertain phenomena. We conclude in Section 4 by considering why Western ethnographers might tend to interpret these practical services as religious institutions.
