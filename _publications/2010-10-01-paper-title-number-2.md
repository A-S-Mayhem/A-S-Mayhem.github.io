excerpt: 'To identify gaps in cybersecurity research, the authors reviewed the secondary literatures of organizational cybersecurity posture, focusing on five factors: technology design, management procedures, organizational structure, legal environment, and human competencies. Their findings show security technology can be improved with advanced technology, usability, and design process. Organizations should employ a unified security platform for all security tools and consider insider threats in the design of cybersecurity-related organizational procedures. Legal literature highlights two major concerns for the future: small and midsized businesses will be major cyberattack victims, and human error is the largest factor in cyberattack success. Given the user as the weakest link of cybersecurity, human-centric technology designers should create human-centric designs in addition to training personnel against cyber incidents.'
