excerpt: 'Research has shown that note-taking serves as an essential cognitive support tool for learning and critical thinking. However, few educational and pro- fessional VR applications incorporate note-taking functionality despite its important role in learning and discovery. In this paper, we present the de- sign and user study of Embodied Notes, a new multi-modal VR note-taking system. We present findings from a user study with 45 college students who used the system for a learning task. We describe how participants used Em- bodied Notes and their perceptions of how it affected their learning. We also highlight design considerations for supporting users’ cognitive processes in future VR note-taking tools for discovery and learning.'
