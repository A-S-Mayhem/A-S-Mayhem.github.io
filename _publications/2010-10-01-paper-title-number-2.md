Highlights
•A proof-of-concept investigation of Autonomous Modular Public Transit (AMPT) service.

•Stylized design models for AMPT on a grid network with demand density scenarios.

•The models explicitly account for pod joining/disjoining and en-route transfers.

•If designed properly, AMPT may be cost effective over traditional transit systems.

•Large passenger time savings by en-route transfer, mixed picture of agency cost.

•Energy savings due to pod train formation (pod platooning).
