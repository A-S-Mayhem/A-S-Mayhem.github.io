Teenagers are juveniles who are addicted to social dating apps usually make these mistakes. To protect them from making a huge mistake of falling into this trap, something desperately needs to be done. The best possible solution would be to build a camera application which by default won’t allow sharing and saving of obscene (nude) images in a user’s phone memory clicked by their camera.
