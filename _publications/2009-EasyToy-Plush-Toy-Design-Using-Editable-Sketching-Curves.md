Abstract: EasyToy is an industrial plush toy design system for novices. Editable sketching curves combine the advantages of free-form strokes and the controllability of B-spline curves. Users can continuously edit each curve to refine designs. EasyToy provides a small set of simple tools with which users can easily construct sophisticated toy models comparable to those that professional systems produce.
