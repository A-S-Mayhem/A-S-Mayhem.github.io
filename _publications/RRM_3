**Abstract**

Here we present our results from the performance of RRM applied to HTP temporal shoot biomass data in response to control and water-limited conditions using Legendre polynomials and spline functions. We selected drought stress because water limitation significantly impacts shoot growth (PSA) and is the major limitation for agricultural productivity and global food security.
