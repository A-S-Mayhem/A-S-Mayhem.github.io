Abstract
======
AI City Challenge 2021 Task 5: The Natural Language-Based Vehicle Tracking is a Natural Language-based Vehicle Retrieval task, which requires retrieving a single-camera track using a set of three natural language descriptions of the specific targets. In this paper, we present our methods to tackle the difficulties of the provided task. Experiments with our approaches on the competitive dataset from AICity Challenge 2021 show that our techniques achieve Mean Reciprocal Rank score of 0.1701 on the public test dataset and 0.1571 on the private test dataset.
