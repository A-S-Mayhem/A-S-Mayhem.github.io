collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-06-01-acl23-evidence-memes
excerpt: 'The paper discusses the challenge of understanding the context of memes and introduces the MEMEX task. We create a dataset called MCC and propose a multimodal neural framework called MIME, which outperforms other models by 4% in F1-score. The study also provides detailed performance analyses and insights into cross-modal contextual associations.'

The paper discusses the challenge of understanding the context of memes and introduces the MEMEX task. We create a dataset called MCC and propose a multimodal neural framework called MIME, which outperforms other models by 4% in F1-score. The study also provides detailed performance analyses and insights into cross-modal contextual associations.
