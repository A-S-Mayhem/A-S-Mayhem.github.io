This cross-cultural study relies on the sample of hunter-gatherers in the electronic Human Relations Area Files (eHRAF) to assess the cross-cultural occurrence of various modes and processes of social learning in distinct cultural domains from the ethnographic record. Results highlight the importance of teaching in the ethnographic record of hunter-gatherer social learning and provide a systematic, cross-cultural, framework for theoretical models to rely on.
