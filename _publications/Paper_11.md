For the first time, 2D symmetric hydrogenated zinc oxide (H-gZnO) and inorganic graphenylene-like zinc oxide (IGP-ZnO) nanosheets have been proposed computationally. Both nanosheets show be stable, and they retain the semiconducting properties. A van der Waals interaction between the hydrogen atoms on H-gZnO is found. It was theoretically demonstrated that the dehydrogenation of H-gZnO leads to spontaneously convert to the IGP-ZnO. The structural differences between 2D nanosheets can lead to different applications. This theoretical prediction is open to experimentalists and other theoreticians for further studies.
