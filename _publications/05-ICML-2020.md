+ Develop a light-weighted auxiliary ”little” module with random projection and weight quantization for probing Neural Network (NN) layerwise output sparsity to facilitate NN inference acceleration; 
+ Theproposed ”little” module inference scheme can be easily applied to various types of neural networks, such as CNN, and LSTM. (e.g., on ResNet-18, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions with much higher FLOPs reduction, memory saving and model accuracy).
