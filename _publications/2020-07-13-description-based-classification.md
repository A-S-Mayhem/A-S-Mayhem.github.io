The paper proposes a novel text classification framework where labels are accompanied by natural language descriptions. These are either handcrafted or learned using reinforcement learning in extractive or abstractive form. Text classification is thus modeled as a binary question answering task. By explicitly aligning textual content with label semantics, the approach enhances model interpretability and performance, especially in multi-label and aspect-based sentiment tasks. The method significantly outperforms traditional classification models across diverse datasets.
