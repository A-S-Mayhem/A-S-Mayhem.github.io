This workshop introduces some tools to automatically detect underperformances on PV installation.

It is broken down into three parts:

1. **Data visualization**: Exploration of weather and PV data 
2. **Power model fit**: Estimation of DC power without faults in order to have a benchmark 
3. **Fault detection**: Algorithm development to automatically detect power underperformances
