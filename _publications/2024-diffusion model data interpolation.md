excerpt: 'Traditionally, site surveys for wind farms are conducted using a grid of ultra-high resolution (UHR) 2D seismic lines, which provide data along specific profiles to support site investigations by mapping stratigraphic units across a survey area and aiding in the identification and localization of shallow hazards. There is also a need for re-siting wind farms and building subsurface models, which requires seismic data beyond the 2D UHR lines. However, these 2D UHR lines leave significant gaps between them, limiting the potential to make greater use of UHR data by filling these gaps through interpolation. This is a challenging task, as the gaps can range from hundreds of meters to several kilometers. Encouraged by the significant success of modern deep learning techniques in various seismic processing tasks, we investigate this specific challenge of extreme sparsity in UHR seismic data using generative modelling (specifically diffusion models) and classical supervised learning (based on U-Net and ResNet). The training and validation data are from UHR data acquired in the German North Sea planned for offshore wind development. The preliminary results show that when irregular missing data is up to 90%, the diffusion model outperforms U-Net and ResNet in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).'

Traditionally, site surveys for wind farms are conducted using a grid of ultra-high resolution (UHR) 2D seismic lines, which provide data along specific profiles to support site investigations by mapping stratigraphic units across a survey area and aiding in the identification and localization of shallow hazards. There is also a need for re-siting wind farms and building subsurface models, which requires seismic data beyond the 2D UHR lines. However, these 2D UHR lines leave significant gaps between them, limiting the potential to make greater use of UHR data by filling these gaps through interpolation. This is a challenging task, as the gaps can range from hundreds of meters to several kilometers. Encouraged by the significant success of modern deep learning techniques in various seismic processing tasks, we investigate this specific challenge of extreme sparsity in UHR seismic data using generative modelling (specifically diffusion models) and classical supervised learning (based on U-Net and ResNet).
