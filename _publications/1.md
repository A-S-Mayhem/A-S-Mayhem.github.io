This paper is about the Stereo VI-DSO, a novel tightly-coupled approach for visual-inertial odometry, which jointly optimizes
all the model parameters within the active window, including the IMU pose, velocity, biases, affine brightness parameters of all
keyframes and the depth values of all selected pixels. The visual part of the system is integrated constraints from static stereo 
into the bundle adjustment pipeline of dynamic multi-view stereo, but unlike keypoint based systems it directly minimizes the
photometric error. Stereo-Vi method can initialize faster than mono-VI. IMU information is accumulated between keyframes using 
measurement pre-integration, and it is inserted into the optimization as an additional constraint between keyframes. In addition, 
we introduce a simulation platform developed on Unreal Engine 4, it can output raw data of most sensors used in the field of 
autonomous driving. We evaluate our method with absolute ground-truth value base on simulation data.,,,,
