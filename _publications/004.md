A weighted compressed sensing (WCS) algorithm is proposed for the problem of channelized facies reconstruction from pixel-based measurements. 

This strategy integrates information from: 

1. Image structure in a transform domain (the discrete cosine transform)
1. A statistical model obtained from the use of multiple-point simulations (MPS) and a training image. 

A method is developed to integrate multiple-point statistics within the context of WCS, using for that a collection of weight definitions. In the experimental validation, excellent results are reported showing that the WCS provides good reconstruction for geological facies models even in the range of 0.3–1.0% pixel-based measurements. 

Experiments show that the proposed solution outperforms methods based on pure CS and MPS, when the performance is measured in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, and similarity perceptual indicators.
