title: "A Reinforcement-Learning Self-Healing Approach for Virtual Network Function Placement"

excerpt: 'Modern networking paradigms like Service Function Chaining (SFC) allow for services to be broken down to a series of ordered and interconnected Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) that can be hosted in generic servers in EdgeCloud datacenters. Nonetheless, a critical issue arises, when a hardware or software failure occurs and the VNFs of an SFC need to be repositioned, allowing to autonomously bring the system back to its normal operation, a process called self-healing. In this paper, a distributed methodology is proposed that aims to address this challenge, considering the requirements of all involved actors. Specifically, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based algorithm is proposed that allows to iteratively optimize and determine an SFC healing solution upon a datacenter failure. As a second stage, a revenue-driven resource allocation mechanism is integrated, to resolve the contention for resources in an …'
