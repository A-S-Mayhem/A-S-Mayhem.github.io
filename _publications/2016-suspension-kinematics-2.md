This paper presents an analysis of the position kinematics of the complete spatial model of double wishbone and MacPherson strut suspension systems. The kinematics' solution is built upon two key elements: the use of Rodrigue's parameters to develop an algebraic set of equations representing the kinematics of the mechanisms, and the computation of Gr√∂bner basis as a method of solving the resulting set of equations.
