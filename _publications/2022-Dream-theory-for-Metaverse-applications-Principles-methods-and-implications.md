Abstract: The metaverse is a digital virtual world generated by the computer, as a hot-spot in the fields of the education, the culture, the technology and the entertainment in recent years. The dream world is a virtual reality world generated by the brain, and is comparable with the metaverse. Different psychological hypotheses were proposed to explain why the brain could construct the immersive, realistic virtual world in dreams. From the functions of the dreams many new ideas of potential applications could be gained for the metaverse. This paper reviews the theoretical hypotheses about the dreams, which could find applications in the metaverse, and to enrich the real and dream world in the entertainment and the social interaction, the skill learning, the counseling and the evaluation, and the trauma therapy. Finally, despite the promising future of the metaverse, there are still important challenges in the development of the metaverse.
