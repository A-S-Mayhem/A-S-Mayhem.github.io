Abstract: We study the combinatorial complexity of Voronoi diagram of point sites on a general triangulated 2-manifold surface, based on the geodesic metric. Given a triangulated 2-manifold $\mathcal{T}$ of $n$ faces and a set of $m$ point sites $S=\{s_1,s_2,...,s_m\}$, we prove that the complexity of Voronoi diagram $V_T(S)$ of $S$ on $\mathcal{T}$ is $O(mn)$ if the genus of $\mathcal{T}$ is zero. For a genus-*g* manifold $\mathcal{T}$ in which the samples in $S$ are dense enough and the resulting Voronoi diagram satisfies the closed ball property, we prove that the complexity of Voronoi diagram $V_T(S)$ is $O((m+g)n)$.
