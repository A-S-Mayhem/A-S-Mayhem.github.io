Next-generation integrated propulsion systems require reliable, robust, low-cost and high performance sensing systems beyond what is expected to be delivered by conventional sensor networks. Emerging fiber-optic sensor networks offer distinct advantages, including multiplexability, cybersecurity, inherent EMI/RFI immunity, high speed and bandwidth, and compatibility with the avionics environment. Ongoing development of a novel reliability analysis methodology to quantify sensor network reliability in harsh environments is discussed. Failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis (FMMEA) was performed for jet engine environments. System design and deployment guidelines were then developed based upon experience in sensor network deployments to harsh environments. Addressing this key technology gap, an integrated fiber-optic network reliability analysis technique based upon  predictive failure models is being developed via rigorous environmental testing of critical optical and optoelectronic components comprising the sensor network. The results of this effort are expected to empower propulsion system sensing and control network engineers to enhance design and deployment for reliability.
