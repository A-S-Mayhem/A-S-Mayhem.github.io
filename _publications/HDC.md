Abstract: With rapid advances of Transformer models, enabling efficient few-shot learning becomes crucial for unlocking new use cases for ubiquitous edge applications with scarce data and tight hardware constraints. It has been shown that Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) can be highly efficient in performing few shot learning with symbolic operations. Despite being faster than neural-network-based methods, however, VSA-based models alone do not extract features effectively and may suffer from readout noises. To get the best of both worlds, in this work, we present a novel neuro-vector-symbolic Vision Transformer (ViT) for few-shot learning tasks. The VSA component of the model acts as an instance-specific sub-module for efficiently memorizing new instances, while the ViT backbone captures high-level, hierarchical information from inputs. We examine and show how the VSA component based upon Holographic Reduced Representation (HRR) infuses generative learning capability into the ViT for the generation tasks. The experiments with the proposed neuro-vector-symbolic ViT demonstrate superior performance in both closed-set and open-set few-shot learning tasks.
