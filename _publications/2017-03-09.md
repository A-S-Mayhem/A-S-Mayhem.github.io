A computational approach, using the density functional theory, is employed to describe the enhanced electron-hole stability and separation in a novel class of semiconducting composite materials, with the so-called double bubble structural motif, which can be used for photocatalytic applications. We examine the double bubble containing SiC mixed with either GaN or ZnO, as well as related motifs that prove to have low formation energies.
