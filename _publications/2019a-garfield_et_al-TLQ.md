excerpt: <blockquote>For the study of leadership, we see tremendous benefits to integrating diverse sources of evidence from studies of animal behavior, paleoanthropology, ethnography, psychology, political science, and other social sciences. The challenge will be to identify and explain universal pat- terns of human leadership systems while still doing justice to their diversity.</blockquote>
