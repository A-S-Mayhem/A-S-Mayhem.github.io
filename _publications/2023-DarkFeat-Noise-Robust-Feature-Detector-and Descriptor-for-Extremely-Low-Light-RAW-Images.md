Abstract: Low-light visual perception, such as SLAM or SfM at night, has received increasing attention, in which keypoint detection and local feature description play an important role. Both handcraft designs and machine learning methods have been widely studied for local feature detection and description, however, the performance of existing methods degrades in the extreme low-light scenarios in a certain degree, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in images. To address this challenge, images in RAW format that retain more raw sensing information have been considered in recent works with a denoise-then-detect scheme. However, existing denoising methods are still insufficient for RAW images and heavily time-consuming, which limits the practical applications of such scheme. In this paper, we propose DarkFeat, a deep learning model which directly detects and describes local features from extreme low-light RAW images in an end-to-end manner.  A novel noise robustness map and selective suppression constraints are proposed to effectively mitigate the influence of noise and extract more reliable keypoints. Furthermore, a customized pipeline of synthesizing dataset containing low-light RAW image matching pairs is proposed to extend end-to-end training. Experimental results show that DarkFeat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both indoor and outdoor parts of the challenging MID benchmark, outperforms the denoise-then-detect methods and significantly reduces computational costs up to 70%.
