Abstract: Offsetting-based hollowing is a solid modeling operation widely used in 3D printing, which can change the model's physical properties and reduce the weight by generating voids inside a model. However, a hollowing operation can lead to additional supporting structures for fabrication in interior voids, which cannot be removed. As a consequence, the result of a hollowing operation is affected by these additional supporting structures when applying the operation to optimize physical properties of different models. This paper proposes a support-free hollowing framework to overcome the difficulty of fabricating voids inside a solid. The challenge of computing a support-free hollowing is decomposed into a sequence of shape optimization steps, which are repeatedly applied to interior mesh surfaces. The optimization of physical properties in different applications can be easily integrated into our framework. Comparing to prior approaches that can generate support-free inner structures, our hollowing operation can reduce more volume of material and thus provide a larger solution space for physical optimization. Experimental tests are taken on a number of 3D models to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework.
