Abstract: Caricature is a type of artistic style of human faces that attracts considerable attention in the entertainment industry. So far a few 3D caricature generation methods exist and all of them require some caricature information (e.g., a caricature sketch or 2D caricature) as input. This kind of input, however, is difficult to provide by non-professional users. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network model that generates high-quality 3D caricatures directly from a normal 2D face photo. The most challenging issue for our system is that the source domain of face photos (characterized by normal 2D faces) is significantly different from the target domain of 3D caricatures (characterized by 3D exaggerated face shapes and textures). To address this challenge, we: (1) build a large dataset of 5,343 3D caricature meshes and use it to establish a PCA model in the 3D caricature shape space; (2) reconstruct a normal full 3D head from the input face photo and use its PCA representation in the 3D caricature shape space to establish correspondences between the input photo and 3D caricature shape; and (3) propose a novel character loss and a novel caricature loss based on previous psychological studies on caricatures. Experiments including a novel two-level user study show that our system can generate high-quality 3D caricatures directly from normal face photos.
