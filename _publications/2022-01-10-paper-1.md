permalink: /publication/2022-01-10-paper-1
excerpt: 'Long-term noise interferometry analysis is conducted over six_years of data using two hydrophones on the Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array. The two hydrophones are separated by 3.2_km and are bottom-mounted at 1500_m. We demonstrate the ability of ambient noise interferometry to reliably detect multi-path arrivals in the deep ocean from bottom-mounted hydrophones. An analysis of the multi-path arrival peak emergence is presented, as well as long-term trends of the signal-to-noise ratio of the arrival peaks. Last, we show that long-term ambient noise interferometry provides the opportunity for monitoring directional, coherent ambient sound such as the fin whale chorus.'
