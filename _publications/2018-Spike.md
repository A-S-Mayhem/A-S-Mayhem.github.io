Abstract
-------
Bionic retinal implants are gaining acceptance in the treatment of blindness from degenerative
diseases including retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration. Objective. A current obstacle to
the improved performance of such implants is the difficulty of comparing the results of disparate
experiments. Another obstacle is the current difficulty in selectively activating the many different
retinal ganglion cell types that are used as separate pathways for visual information to the brain.
Approach. To address these obstacles, we propose a modelling framework based on white noise
stimulation and reverse correlation. In this perspective, we first outline early developments in
visual retinal physiology leading up to the implementation of white noise stimuli and spike triggered averaging. 
We then review recent efforts to adapt the white noise method for electrical
stimulation of the retina and some of the nuances of this approach. Main results. Based on such
white noise methods, we describe a modelling framework whereby the effect of any arbitrary
electrical stimulus on a ganglion cell’s neural code can be better understood. Significance. This
framework should additionally disentangle the effects of stimulation on photoreceptor, bipolar
cell and retinal ganglion cell—ultimately supporting selective stimulation of specific ganglion cell
types for a more nuanced bionic retinal implant. Finally, we point to upcoming considerations in
this rapidly developing domain of research
