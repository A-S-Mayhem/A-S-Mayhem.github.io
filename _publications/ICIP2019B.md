## Abstract
This paper combines spatially-variant filtering and non-local low-rank regularization (NLR) to exploit non-local similarity in natural images in addressing the problem of image interpolation. We propose to build a carefully designed spatially-variant, non-local filtering scheme to generate a reliable estimate of the interpolated image and utilize NLR to refine the estimation. Our work uses a simple, parallelizable algorithm without the need to solve complicated optimization problems. Experiment results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly improves PSNR and SSIM of the interpolated images compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.
