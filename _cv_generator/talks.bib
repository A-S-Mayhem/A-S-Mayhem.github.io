  abstractnote = {Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is a technology that transforms telecommunication fiber optic cables into dense sensor arrays by continuously transmitting pulses of light down the cable and measuring backscattering from natural inhomogeneities within the fiber cable. The technology can densely sample the acoustic field over long ranges (up to 100 km), providing a means for large scale passive acoustic monitoring. To evaluate the capabilities of DAS, it is necessary to benchmark and calibrate the technology relative to traditional hydrophone data. The DAS Calibration Experiment 2022 (DASCAL22) recorded 9 days of both DAS and hydrophone data in Puget Sound, WA in October 2022. The DAS data were recorded with a sample rate of 2 kHz, and the cable extended 3.5 km on the seafloor between two islands, reaching depths of 100 m, and the hydrophones were moored adjacent to the DAS cable at 5 m and 25 m from the seafloor. The recordings include impulses from an active source at 1 m, 5 m, and 10 m depths, and an abundance of passive acoustic data corresponding to ship traffic, wind, and rain. This work aims to draw comparisons between the hydrophone and DAS recordings to evaluate the capability of DAS at detecting sounds at frequencies as high as 1 kHz.},

  abstractnote = {Fiber optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is a recent innovation utilized primarily in the seismic community for measuring seismic acoustics signals at low frequencies (single digit Hz and below). The technique utilizes strain rates in a fiber optic cable, observed via the backscatter of light pulses, to measure the acoustic field. Recently, the capabilities of this technology to measure higher frequency acoustic fields (10s to 100s of Hz) have been explored. Low frequency marine mammals calls at ∼20 Hz and ship noises have been successfully recorded, and a recent experiment demonstrated the capability to record up to ∼500 Hz. This talk provides an overview of DAS technology and introduces two recent experiments for studying water column acoustics with DAS. A 4-day experiment conducted in November 2020 as part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) provides data along two fiber optic cables extending west from the coast of Oregon by 65 km and 95 km, reaching depths of 590 m and 1575 m, respectively. DASCAL22, a recent experiment from October 2022, simultaneously recorded data using DAS at 2 kHz sampling rate on a cable extending 3.54km at ∼100 m depth and multiple moored hydrophones placed close to the DAS cable, allowing direct comparison between a new and existing technology.},

  abstractnote = {Ambient noise interferometry is a passive acoustic technique for environment characterization. The technique uses coherent ambient sound to approximate the Green’s function between two sensors. It has previously been used in ocean acoustics to passively estimate water temperature, sound-speed structure, and mode shapes as well as for sensor localization. Since this technique utilizes the ambient noise field, whose characteristics are often unknown, understanding the effects of non-isotropic ambient sound is important for ambient noise interferometry. In this talk, an overview of the theoretical literature for noise interferometry will be presented with a specific emphasis on the effects of non-isotropic ocean noise source distributions. Additionally, simulations that explore the emergence of the Green’s function will be presented. Specifically, sound source distributions and environmental parameters such as sound speed profile will be explored. Lastly, the implications of these works on the possibilities and limitations of ambient noise interferometry will be discussed. [Work supported by the ONR.]},

This technique has been widely demonstrated as a powerful tool for seismic sensing, but the efficacy of submerged, under-sea cables for ocean acoustic sensing remains underexplored. The ocean observatories initiative (OOI) conducted a distributed acoustic sensing experiment in November of 2021, where two of the fiber optic cables continuously recorded the strain rate for four days. In this talk, the ambient sound field recorded by the OOI DAS experiment will be explored. A statistical comparison of hydrophone measurements and DAS measurements will be presented.

  abstractnote = {The ocean observatories initiative has eleven hydrophones that constantly record ambient sound throughout the north-east Pacific Ocean. Nine of the hydrophones are mounted on the seafloor and two of the hydrophones are suspended in the sound fixing and ranging channel. Six of the hydrophones record broadband ambient sound with a sampling rate of 64 kHz. Five of the hydrophones record low frequency ambient sound with a sampling rate of 200 Hz. In this talk, an overview of research and outreach conducted by the Ocean Data Lab at the University of Washington that utilizes this acoustic data will be presented. Some of the research topics that will be presented include trends in ambient sound and using ambient noise interferometry to estimate the Green’s function between two hydrophones. For the trends in ambient sound, data from 9 of the hydrophones over six years is visualized, analyzed, and compared to previous results. Data recorded by two low-frequency hydrophones has successfully been used to estimate the Green’s function between the two hydrophones by measuring the coherence of the ambient sound. Additionally, data of opportunity has been used to experimentally explore the emergence of the Green’s function for bottom mounted hydrophones in the north-east pacific. Lastly, an online, interactive data explorer for the low frequency hydrophones will be presented. This data explorer provides the opportunity for the public to view and explore the low frequency acoustic data measured and provided by the Ocean Observatories Initiative. [work supported by ONR]},
