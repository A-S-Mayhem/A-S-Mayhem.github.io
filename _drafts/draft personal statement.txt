1.) Scientific Motivation: My interests in psychology and math are what first brought me into the Economics department, but it was the research of the professors I was taught by that cemented my passion for economics and my planned pursuit of graduate studies. The professors I engaged with did research on topics ranging from the impact of direct deposit on savings rates and agricultural production  for farmers in Malawi to how much did the MTV show “16 and Pregnant” reduce teen pregnancy rates in the United States, and their work has been able to influence policies to improve the lives of people. I know that because of the positive social impact and the breadth of research that economics encompasses, I will always have room to grow as a researcher and contributing member of society and to pursue whatever topics I become interested in, including my current interest in housing. During my graduate studies and beyond, I plan to research the factors that lead to homebuyer and to share my results with financial institutions and policy makers in hopes of fostering a greater understanding of the needs of homebuyers.

2.) Educational Background: In May of 2018 I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art. While the courses in printmaking and steel sculpture might not have provided me with any hard skills beneficial for  graduate study, I credit most of my soft skills to my art education. The time I spent in the studio gave me time and project management, creative problem solving, and an attention to detail that no economics or math course could. The Economics degree did provide me with the theoetical knowledge and technical skills necessary through courses such as: econometrics with time series; development, labor, and behavioral economics; and multivariable calculus and statistics. Upon graduating, I was concerned about my math preparation and have continued to take courses on mathmatical proof, differential equations, and real analysis. The classroom experiences I have had have laid the groundwork for my research and professional knowledge to grow.

I have also been a research assistant twice, completed a two person research capstone, and am currently doing research in my work and free time.

8.) Future Scientific Goals: 

I'd like to say I've always wanted to study economics, but my path to grad school hasn't been that straightforward. When I graduated from high school, I was only registered as a Studio Art Major and my experience with "economics" consisted of watching news anchors squabble about the economy and a general disinterest in home economics. Looking back, I'm surprised it took me until my sophomore year of college to realize that economics bridges the gaps between my interest in math, psychology, and public policy. It wasn't until I started engaging more with the professors in the department and learning more about their research and the impact it can have on the lives of people that I realized economics was for me. Because I had to struggle to find economics, one of my priorities is to find ways to share economics with a broader audience and make the research and findings acessible for everyone.
