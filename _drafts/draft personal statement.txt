1.) Scientific Motivation: My interests in psychology and math are what first brought me into the Economics department, but it was the research of the professors I was taught by that cemented my passion for economics and my planned pursuit of graduate studies. The professors I engaged with did research on topics ranging from the impact of direct deposit on savings rates and agricultural production  for farmers in Malawi to how much did the MTV show “16 and Pregnant” reduce teen pregnancy rates in the United States, and their work has been able to influence policies to improve the lives of people. I know that because of the positive social impact and the breadth of research that economics encompasses, I will always have room to grow as a researcher and contributing member of society and to pursue whatever topics I become interested in, including my current interest in housing. During my graduate studies and beyond, I plan to research the factors that lead to homebuyer and to share my results with financial institutions and policy makers in hopes of fostering a greater understanding of the needs of homebuyers. 
2.) Educational Background: In May of 2018 I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art.
