Upon graduating from high school, I knew a few things: 1.) The economy, according to the political pundits squabbling on TV, consisted of bulls, bears, and the current state of the DOW 2.) Blink by Malcolm Gladwell had fostered my fascination with psychology and human decision making, but I did not want to be a therapist 3.) I had always had an aptitude for math, but I couldn’t picture what I could do with a degree in math. Sometimes I wonder how much easier it could have been if I had just known an economist or if my school had offered any economics courses. Since graduating from college, I now know a few more things: 1.) Economics combines all aspects of psychology and math that I love 2.) Now that I’ve found economics, I will never stop learning 3.) There is so much value in economic research and I want to contribute both by finding new methods and channels for engaging readers with the results and by wherever possible sharing economics with others. In hindsight, it’s clear to me that economics is the discipline for me, but due to a lack of exposure, I nearly missed out. It is my responsibility now and throughout the rest of my career to reach and inspire the future generations of economists.
Through the Economics Association (EAM) and the Promoting Achievement and Diversity in Economics Program (PADE), I consistently engaged with the economics community. As the Director of Tutoring with EAM, I recruited 6 of my peers to serve as tutors and lead tutoring sessions for over 500 students in the introductory micro and macro economics courses. Then as Vice President I continued to tutor as well as being more involved with student outreach. I planned multiple career exploration events with recruiters and previous graduates from Maryland. The most fulfilling event that I was able to plan was our Maryland Day booth. During Maryland day, the university opens its doors to the local communities to celebrate Maryland and show off all the work being done by the groups on campus. As the face of the Economics Department, I taught kids and adults alike about the power of risk aversion in a candy coin toss lottery. It was always fun and exciting to see people engage with the material and show that economics can be applied to nearly everything.
Previous Research: The Act of Settlement of 1701 included a provision that attempted to reduce the influence of monarchs on Judges’ decisions by giving parliament the sole right to remove judges. This Act is widely regarded as the foundation of the tenure that allows for judicial independence today. However, the Act did not apply to all judges during the 17th and 18th centuries, thus allowing measurement of the effect of judicial tenure on judicial performance. As Dr. Murrell’s research assistant, this project allowed me to gain an understanding of the research process from start to finish, the challenges associated with getting useful data, and the creativity that sometimes must be employed to fill in the gaps. I collected biographical data on judges which proved to be a much harder task than I expected. Common names, misspellings, difficult to read handwritten documents, and a lack of documentation all made the process a challenge. I was able to identify patterns in missing birth and death data, and propose imputations based on documentation of other life events that while likely incorrect, would be close to the actual date and allow for greater data usage. Through this research I also learned the importance of documenting your work both for replicability and future projects, which was especially important given the number of resources cross-referenced. 
The “double-trigger” theory of mortgage default states that negative equity combined with a negative income shock, such as job loss, are an impetus for default.  However, even at Fannie Mae we often do not have monthly borrower level employment data. When reviewing the current practices in a sample of single-family models, I found that unemployment enters through aggregate unemployment metrics at varying levels of granularity. This poses an interesting question: can aggregate unemployment be a proxy for individual employment status? To answer this, I first turned to a paper by Gyourko and Tracy. According to their research, individual unemployment is an important risk factor, but aggregate metrics are a poor proxy leading to under estimation of unemployment risk (due to attenuation bias). Testing specifications of several default models seems to confirm these findings, particularly in complex models that already contain a variety of additional macroeconomic indicators.
