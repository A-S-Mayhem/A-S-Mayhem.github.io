# Logic

- Original timeline
  - Jesus died right around Passover
  - Exactly what day is a matter of some debate
  - He rose from the dead after 3 days
- First debate: Should we celebrate on that day?
  - Could follow Passover
    - But Passover can come on different days of the week
    - So no particular "day" that Jesus was resurrected in this sense
  - Eventual answer is: should celebrate Easter on a Sunday
    - Idea here is that he was resurrected on a Sunday the first time?
- So then people went for the first Sunday after Passover
  - This presents a problem: how to pick Passover?
- Early method was: ask the Jews
  - Christians didn't like this
  - They didn't like Jews, so they didn't like asking them
  - Also, they were afraid the Jews were doing it wrong
- Jews celebrate Passover on 14th of Nisan (on a lunar calendar)
  - Nisan is supposed to be the first month of spring
  - Another way to ask about "spring" is after the equinox
  - But sometimes the 14th of Nisan fell before the equinox
  - This was because lunar calendars required intercalation, which wasn't solidified yet
- First Council of Nicaea (lots of stuff happened there!)
  - Easter must be celebrated by all throughout the world on the same Sunday
  - this Sunday must follow the fourteenth day of the paschal moon;
  - that moon was to be accounted the paschal moon whose fourteenth day followed the spring equinox;
  - some provision should be made for determining the proper date of Easter and communicating it to the rest of the world
- How do you find the equinox?
  - This was put at March 21 (but on which calendar?)
  - Primary motivation for Gregorian reform was to align March 21 with the equinox
  - Only difference is that Gregorian omits the leap day every 400 years
  - And to get things on track, in 1582, 10 days were skipped to get things even
- But when are the lunar months?
  - Early solution was to actually look for new moons and stuff
  - But if you want the same answer everywhere, you need something computable, in advance
  - So "ecclesiastical" new moon might not be the same as the actual new moon
  - Synodic month (eg full moon to full moon) is 29.53 days long
    - Lunar year (12 synodic months) is 354-355 days
    - So you need to insert an extra month at some point, once the break is more than 30 days
  - First solution is the Metonic cycle
    - 235 synodic months is *almost* 19 tropical years (error of 1 day per 219 years)
    - But this is an approximation to an approximation (Julian calendar)
    - So this had gotten a few days out of whack by 15th century
