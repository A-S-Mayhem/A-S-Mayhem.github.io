# Idea
I will reach out to biologists to understand the status, progress and experimental methods regarding all areas relevant to [mind uploading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading) and reproducing a human brain's algorithm in a computer.

# More details
A basic goal of neuroscience is to understand a human brain's development and activity well enough that one could, in principle, reproduce its abilities in a computer. On an atomic scale, the brain is described by known quantum-mechanical principles - so with the computing power found in thought experiments, such a simulation is possible if [^1] we have a sufficiently accurate description of

1. a human zygote, and
2. the environment in which that zygote develops into an adult human, inside and outside the womb.

I argue that, most likely, the greatest part of both of these "sufficiently accurate descriptions" exist today - and that a smartphone has enough memory to store them:

1. By the data on [human genome size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome), the human DNA can be described using less than 700 Megabytes.
2. The raw data entering a brain before adulthood would need some orders of magnitude more storage space. But again, I argue it's more plausible than not that the _relevant_ data can be compressed to less than a few Gigabytes, if not less. [^3]


# Breaking down the problem
This concerns essentially all [arXiv quantitative biology subcategories](https://arxiv.org/archive/q-bio).

Consider a fresh zygote in a womb, about to develop into a human containing a brain.
1. Th
- protein expression and formation of biochemical pathways,
  - neural differentiation - which types of neurons exist, and how stem cells decide which one to become,
  - arborization - how neurons decide how to branch out and connect to each other,
  - neuron-level activity - how to model 
  - synaptic plasticity,
  - and overarching design principles.
The goal of the talk is not to explain all of neuroscience and microbiology - it is to give, for each level, a rough understanding of
  - the amount of yet-unknown data and insight versus the capabilities of current experimental methods,
  - how fast and (Moore-like) predictably we can expect these methods to improve,
  - and pointers to recent literature.

# Whom to ask?

# What to ask?

My plan is to ask people

[^1]: The algorithm is typically described as having a random component - nevertheless, a simulation must typically return a working human brain if a typical embryo develops into a brain as well.
