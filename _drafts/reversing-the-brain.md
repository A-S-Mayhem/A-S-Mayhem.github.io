# Idea
I will reach out to biologists to understand the status, progress and experimental methods regarding all areas relevant to [mind uploading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading) and reproducing a human brain's algorithm in a computer.

# More details
A basic goal of neuroscience is to understand a human brain's development and activity well enough that one could, in principle, reproduce its abilities in a computer. On an atomic scale, the brain is described by known quantum-mechanical principles - so with the computing power found in thought experiments, such a simulation is possible if [^1] we have a sufficiently accurate description of

1. a human zygote, and
2. the environment in which that zygote develops into an adult human, inside and outside the womb.

I argue that, most likely, the greatest part of both of these "sufficiently accurate descriptions" exist today - and that a smartphone has enough memory to store them:

1. By the data on [human genome size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome), the zygote's DNA can be described using less than 400 Megabytes. The central dogma  
2. The raw data entering a brain before adulthood would need some orders of magnitude more storage space. But again, I argue it's more plausible than not that the _relevant_ data can be compressed to less than a few Gigabytes, if not less. For example, [this study](https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/2016_AJSLP-15-0169#T2) finds that a typical infant overhears on the order of 15 000 (English) words a day. Compressing the King James bible with LZMA yields a file that takes 1.35 bytes per word - extrapolating, one obtain 200 Megabytes of spoken English overheard before age 25. To give another estimate, a college student taking 4 classes a semester for 8 semesters, each of which is based on a 500-page book with 250 words per page, will have studied 4 million words of content while obtainig their degree.
3. brain certainly takes in orders of magnitude more raw sensual data than that. But 
4. The raw sensual data taken in during development of a brain . For comparison, it is estimated that A developing brain takes in

# Breaking down the problem
- protein expression and formation of biochemical pathways,
  - neural differentiation - which types of neurons exist, and how stem cells decide which one to become,
  - arborization - how neurons decide how to branch out and connect to each other,
  - neuron-level activity - how to model 
  - synaptic plasticity,
  - and overarching design principles.
The goal of the talk is not to explain all of neuroscience and microbiology - it is to give, for each level, a rough understanding of
  - the amount of yet-unknown data and insight versus the capabilities of current experimental methods,
  - how fast and (Moore-like) predictably we can expect these methods to improve,
  - and pointers to recent literature.

This concerns essentially all [arXiv quantitative biology subcategories](https://arxiv.org/archive/q-bio).

My plan is to ask people

[^1]: The algorithm is typically described as having a random component - nevertheless, a simulation must typically return a working human brain if a typical embryo develops into a brain as well.
