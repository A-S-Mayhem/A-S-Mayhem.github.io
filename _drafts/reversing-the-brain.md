# Plan
I will reach out to biologists to understand the status, progress and experimental methods regarding all areas relevant to [mind uploading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading) and reproducing a human brain's algorithm in a computer.

## More details
A basic goal of neuroscience is to understand a human brain's development and activity well enough that one could, in principle, reproduce its abilities in a computer. Philosophy aside, we know that quantum mechanics describes its evolution on the scale of atoms. So if we have a sufficiently powerful computer and sufficiently accurate descriptions of

- a zygote that will develops into a body brain,
- the influences the developing brain receives from its environment, inside and outside the womb,

we will be 

we will be able to tell 
- a 

This is 


So to 
  - protein expression and formation of biochemical pathways,
  - neural differentiation - which types of neurons exist, and how stem cells decide which one to become,
  - arborization - how neurons decide how to branch out and connect to each other,
  - neuron-level activity - how to model 
  - synaptic plasticity,
  - and overarching design principles.
The goal of the talk is not to explain all of neuroscience and microbiology - it is to give, for each level, a rough understanding of
  - the amount of yet-unknown data and insight versus the capabilities of current experimental methods,
  - how fast and (Moore-like) predictably we can expect these methods to improve,
  - and pointers to recent literature.

This concerns essentially all [arXiv quantitative biology subcategories](https://arxiv.org/archive/q-bio).

My plan is to ask people
