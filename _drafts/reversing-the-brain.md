# Idea
I will reach out to biologists to understand the status, progress and experimental methods regarding all areas relevant to [mind uploading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading) and reproducing a human brain's algorithm in a computer.

# More details
A basic goal of neuroscience is to understand a human brain's development and activity well enough that one could, in principle, reproduce its abilities in a computer. On an atomic scale, the brain is described by known quantum-mechanical principles - so with the computing power found in thought experiments, such a simulation is possible if [^1] we have a sufficiently accurate description of

1. a human zygote, and
2. the environment in which that zygote develops into an adult human, inside and outside the womb.

My guess is that the greatest part of either of these "sufficiently accurate descriptions" exist today - and that a smartphone has enough memory to store them:

1. The zygote's DNA store [central dogma of molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology) states that information flow in a 



we will be able to tell

This is 


# Breaking down the problem
- protein expression and formation of biochemical pathways,
  - neural differentiation - which types of neurons exist, and how stem cells decide which one to become,
  - arborization - how neurons decide how to branch out and connect to each other,
  - neuron-level activity - how to model 
  - synaptic plasticity,
  - and overarching design principles.
The goal of the talk is not to explain all of neuroscience and microbiology - it is to give, for each level, a rough understanding of
  - the amount of yet-unknown data and insight versus the capabilities of current experimental methods,
  - how fast and (Moore-like) predictably we can expect these methods to improve,
  - and pointers to recent literature.

This concerns essentially all [arXiv quantitative biology subcategories](https://arxiv.org/archive/q-bio).

My plan is to ask people

[^1]: The algorithm is typically described as having a random component - nevertheless, a simulation must typically return a working human brain if a typical embryo develops into a brain as well.
