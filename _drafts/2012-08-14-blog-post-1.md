Broader Impacts:
During my undergraduate career, I was very involved with the Economics Association at Maryland (EAM. During my sophomore year, I was named Director of Tutoring, and in that role, I recruited 6 of my peers to serve as tutors and lead tutoring sessions for over 500 students in the introductory micro and macro economics courses. I then served as the Vice President and continued to be a tutor under the new director of tutoring for the rest of my time at Maryland. As vice president, I was able to be much more involved with the student outreach. I planned multiple career exploration events with recruiters and previous graduates from Maryland designed to help undergraduate students to figure out their post-graduation options. The most fulfilling event that I was able to plan was our Maryland Day booth. During Maryland day, the university opens its doors to the local communities to celebrate Maryland and show off all the work being done by the groups on campus. As the face of the Economics Department, I taught kids and adults alike about the power of risk aversion in a candy coin toss lottery. It was always fun and exciting to see people engage with the material and show that economics can be applied to nearly everything. 
Throughout my involvement with the Economics Association, I discovered the Promoting Achievement and Diversity in Economics fellowship (PADE), run by Dr. Jessica Goldberg. The fellowship is designed to help students from groups underrepresented in Economics to succeed in their classes and possibly pursue a career in Economics. In this fellowship I had the opportunity to learn more about the research around Economics, built confidence in my graduate plans, and help my peers also in the program. In our weekly meetings with the grad student mentor, we studied for classes, worked on projects and applications, and discussed economic research papers. It was a great chance to engage in mutual peer mentoring and to build a support network that continues to this day. 
Since graduating, I have continued my involvement with helping my local community, although now that community is Washington, DC. I am on the board of the Young Professional’s Employee Resource Group at Fannie Mae and in this role,  I have planned several volunteer events (SERVE Events) for our 250 + members. We have had several events making snack bags for Martha’s table and toiletry kits for Friendship Place, two nonprofits focused providing support to those less fortunate. I have also participated in other SERVE events including making blankets and emergency kits for those impacted by natural disaster, making and serving holiday meals to the homeless, and I am signed up for the November trip to Puerto Rico to rebuild homes impacted by hurricane Maria.
