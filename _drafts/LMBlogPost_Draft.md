I have been keeping my notes offline since the beginning of my Ph.D., however, I think sharing thoughts at an earlier phase before thinking hard on them can turn out to be very useful discussions while also helping others. Thus I decided to visit and write here occasionally.

All said this very first blog post will be an introductory one where I talk very briefly about my research perspective and the topic I have been working on so far. So, let me start by talking about what kept me busy for the last few years: Dialogue state tracking.

### What is Dialogue State Tracking?


Do not let the name confuse you in any way, there is a high chance you have used a system that is powered with this task behind. If you have ever talked to a digital agent online (through chat or voice) and purchased a service or a product here you go! The problem of automatically extracting user preferences from these conversations has the fancy name of *dialogue state tracking* in NLP. You can think of users' preferences (*e.g.* the location or date of a hotel booking) as the states of the conversation and the task is to simply **track** these states throughout the dialogue turns.  

**Insert an explanatory image here**

### Okay but what is the big deal?

So now that we have settled a simple understanding of the task let's talk about why is this an important problem? So why simply am I spending my time so that the next dialogue agent you talk to would not respond *"I don't recognize that command"*? Simple! 

&#8594; To finish my thesis.

Okay, it is not just that. I believe the translation to an industrial impact of this research topic is to be able to automate the call-centers all around the world. Recent advancements in technology let us replace much of the predictable physical work with automated systems like assembly lines, simple packaging, cashiers *, etc.*. There is also active research in the AI community to do more such as driverless cars. Automating call centers is no toy problem when compared to self-driving cars. It has many challenges: 
- Conversations are noisy with unexpected input from users.
- New business models introduce new services/items but lack the necessary amount of data. Thus we need a strategy that adapts our existing models with fewer data in less time.

So my excitement in this topic is exactly on this last point. I am fairly interested in training pipelines that help models generalize to new domains with low or no supervision at all. I am not going to delve into many details yet, as it is just an introductory post but I hope this read at least help you in knowing me better :)

Take care.
