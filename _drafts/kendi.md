# What I was taught

- There is racial progress: un-racism beating racism
- Sometimes you get 1 step back, but you get 2 steps forward
- E.g., Obama and Trump
- Racism is a mostly personal thing
- That personal thing leads to the systemic things
- Or, maybe, the systemtic thing exists because of something Black people do

# What Kendi says

## Big ideas

- Personal gain (for rich & powerful) motivates racist policy
- Personal gain (for the patronized) leads to justification
- Those justifications (& cognitive dissonance) lead to personal hate
- Racism and antiracism have continued to evolve in this country
- It's not a changing pie chart; it's parallel evolution
- "Racism" means making a decision about a *group*
    - Segregationism (Black people are inherently & permanently inferior) is
      the easy-to-recognize form
    - Assimilationism (Black people can get to be like Whites) is the more
      insidious form
        - To say, there are no more real barriers; it's on Black people now is
          this form
    - Antiracism has always been the minority; that's where we need to be

## Mind benders

- Early people making up racism and justifications for slavery. Total soup of
  crazy ideas.
- Obama elected. People say "racism is over". Who does that benefit to say
  that? Those people who would have to do something about racism if it weren't
  over.
- War on Drugs (drug use was declining), Willie Horton, Southern strategy.
  These are an evolution of racism.
- Supreme Court case re: UC and quotas. Standardized testing predicts race better
  than performance, but accuracy of testing was taken for granted.
- GI Bill, etc. all give advantages, facially neutrally, but de facto to whites.
  But any program designed to correct the imbalance is said to give people
  (Black people) that they get things for free.
    - E.g., don't give land to freed slaves, because then they'll think they
      get something for nothing.
    - So what, their uncompensated labor and brutalization didn't count?
