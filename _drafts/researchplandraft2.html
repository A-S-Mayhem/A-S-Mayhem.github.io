Evaluating the Impact of Homebuyer Education and Financial Benefits on Loan Performance for Low- and Moderate-Income Borrowers 
Homebuyer education and counseling (HEC) programs are designed to help low- and moderate-income borrowers navigate the homebuying process and increase financial literacy with the intent of reducing default rates. However, 62% of all defaults are due to a borrower’s inability to pay, and half of those who default do so because making mortgage payments would have left them unable to meet immediate needs for food and other necessary expenses.   While increased financial literacy can improve budgeting and saving habits, it cannot prevent negative income shocks. Typically, HEC programs are evaluated by comparing default rates using data from the down payment assistance programs, which do not provide financial benefits beyond the initial home purchase. The impact of HEC programs is unclear, and there is no evidence about the interaction between financial education programs and more flexible forms of financial assistance. I propose evaluating HomeReady® (HR), an affordable mortgage product offered by Fannie Mae, to understand the impact of homebuyer education on delinquency related outcomes when paired with a continuous financial benefit. This research will address academic questions about the roles of information compared to credit constrains in mortgage default and will have direct implications for the design of HEC and mortgage assistance.  
Proposal Summary - HomeReady® Mortgages: Since 2015, Fannie Mae has offered HomeReady®, an affordable mortgage, to households with income at or below 80% of their area’s median income with at least one borrower who has completed homebuyer education. Unlike other mortgage programs, HR has caps on the risk-based fees that increase the price of a loan called loan level price adjustments (LLPA). Mortgage lenders can keep the benefit of reduced LLPAs as profit or transfer the benefit to borrowers through a better rate. I can then compare three groups: (1) borrowers who have been eligible for HR based on their income but did not participate or receive HEC, (2) HR borrowers whose rate at origination is at or above the market rate, and (3) HR borrowers whose rate at origination is below the market rate and who thus enjoy a financial benefit in addition to HEC. I propose evaluating the effect of HEC alone and combined with a financial benefit on delinquency using secondary data analysis to understand the role of financial literacy in delinquency and payment choices for low-income households.
Methodology:  The ideal dataset is the internal Fannie Mae acquisition data containing borrower and loan characteristic information and loan-level monthly performance data, which can be requested for academic purposes. Merging the datasets allows me to build a credit profile and payment history for each borrower. I can then construct binary response variables indicating early delinquency (going 90 days delinquent within the first 6 months/1 year/2 years etc.). Early delinquency can be used as a proxy for default risk given that going seriously delinquent is a precursor to default.
Selection bias may be present in the data because people who select into HR are very likely fundamentally different from those who do not. Using the subset of borrowers who meet the income requirement HR, I can determine for each MSA the HR participation by lender and the median HR participation. A measure of the lender’s likelihood of recommending HR can be determined by comparing the lender’s HR participation rate to the MSA’s median HR participation rate; instrumenting using this measure in place of a direct HR indicator can account for selection bias because lender’s likelihood to recommend HR is unlikely to be correlated with borrower delinquency. 
I propose several logistic regressions to explore the effect of HEC, and HEC combined with financial incentives:
Y=β_0+ β_1 HR+ β_2 SATO+ β_3 HR x SATO+ β_4 X
Where Y is one of the response variables defined above, X is a vector of borrower and loan characteristics at the time of acquisition, HR is a binary indicator of whether a loan is a part of the HR program, SATO is the note rate spread at time of origination, and HR * SATO is an interaction effect for HR and SATO. I will also use propensity score matching estimated based on the rich set of variables included in loan applications to account for selection into the HR program
Since HomeReady® began in 2015, there is a limited history of the product which inhibits my ability to study the effect of HEC later in the loan lifecycle. Additionally, the economic conditions since 2015 have been favorable. Understanding borrower behavior and mortgage loan programs during adverse economic conditions is outside the scope of this research proposal. 
Additional response variables that could be tested include delinquency cure rates (after going 90 days delinquent, did they make up the payments), and modification rates. Delinquency cure rates and modification rates are possibly noisy proxies for financial literacy of a borrower, given that a financially savvy borrower more likely to establish a budget for making up payments or pursue modification options available to them. Using these response variables could allow for estimations of the effect of HEC on financial literacy, controlling for financial benefits.
Intellectual Merit: This proposal would evaluate the effectiveness of HEC on early delinquency when used in conjunction with continued financial benefits. The previous literature focuses on the direct impact of financial education on eventual default but does not address the role of financial constraints or complementarities between financial education and lower interest rates. Therefore, I evaluate a more comprehensive bundle of treatments with different potential mechanisms. 
Broader Impacts: On average, the homeownership rate for low income individuals is 15 percentage points lower than the national rate.   Additionally, low income homeowners experience higher mortgage default rates, with the lowest income groups experiencing the highest default rates.   It is important to evaluate programs designed to reduce default and increase access to home ownership because home ownership is a recognized path to asset accumulation and long term economic stability, and to better schools, safer neighborhoods, and other amenities hat are associated with the opportunity gap for minority youth.  My own work as an analyst ad Fannie Mae has made me aware of the lack of evidence about the effect of existing programs and about the margins at which large-scale programs could be adjusted. I am committed to continuing to work to expand housing access and financial stability for minority communities through research that builds on my years of practical experience in the low-income housing field. I also look forward to advocating for the inclusion of these research questions in the agendas of my future classmates, and eventually, to offering my own students a view of how economists can use their tools to study this fundamental question of access and equity in America.
