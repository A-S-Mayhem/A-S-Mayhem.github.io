# Coping with the coaster

Sometime last year, an advisor told me that one of the most useful tidbits he'd gotten about being in a startup was that the "roller coaster" description of startups isn't quite right - it's not really that you go up and down and up and down. When a startup is growing, it's that the highs are higher and the lows are lower. It's less of a roller coaster, and more of a sine wave with increasing amplitude. 
Somehow, this comforted me.

As I wrote in [Part 1](/posts/2022/11/early-startup-employee-change) of this series, the most important thing that helped me cope was recognizing that **unless you're the founder, you can't change the company**.
I encourage you to read Part 1 for more on this, but it's worth reiterating that as an early employee, you are, at the end of the day, just an employee.
That said, I did pick up a few other strategies to help me cope with the emotional roller coaster/sine wave of being an early employee at an early-stage startup.

# Growth means change

At the beginning when you joined your startup, there were what felt like a million possible paths for the company to take.
But as you grow, the options necessarily narrow as you find product-market fit, as investors ask you to focus and demonstrate impact, as the reality of building something to scale hits in - the constraints on a 100-person company are very different than on the 5-person group project you initially joined.
It's important to recognize these changes and change with them.
Otherwise, you might get stuck wishing that things would go a different route that's no longer available, wishing you could be involved in every project even though that's become physically impossible, or wanting to do a job that simply doesn't exist anymore because of the way the company has changed.
 For more on coping with this necessary adaptation, I highly recommend the ever-popular "Letting go of your Legos" blog post.

# Focus on your timeline

As an early employee, you were likely part of exciting conversations full of big ideas and bigger dreams of where this company could go.
But the reality of a growing company is that you get farther from those conversations as it grows - especially if you're experiencing hyper-growth, you may find yourself quite far from them.
It's the founders' jobs to dream - and like we mentioned in [Part 1](/posts/2022/11/early-startup-employee-change), if they don't want you in there dreaming with them then there's nothing you can about it.
That means that if the company's growth goes in a direction you don't agree with 100%, or you start to see some changes in mission that you don't agree with, it might be really difficult. 
In general, you'll likely feel the pain of your company's shortcomings more acutely than other employees, because you were there from the start.

When you're in the early stage of your startup journey, all of the different timelines and opportunities are still available.
But as you grow, you and your company start to pick individual timelines and go down them.
You can't keep looking to your side at all the other parallel timelines you and your company aren't on, because they're not available - they branched off a long time ago, or were never available to you to begin with.
You just have to focus on the timeline you're currently on, recognize its merits in addition to its shortcomings, and put your efforts toward making _that_ timeline the best it can possibly be.

# Divest from the mission (a little)

Another important way to cope with getting farther from the early stage dreams is to divest yourself from them.
As startups grow, you go from being an integral contributor across all aspects of the company to just another employee.
In other words, the company stops seeing you as a key and core element and instead sees you as just another employee.
So it helps to do the same, and change your attitude to view it as just a job.
A really great job, ideally with lots of opportunity and meaning, but still a job nonetheless.

Again, you're not the founder - you're just an employee. 
As the company grows, it will start to treat you as such. So you should do the same for it too.

# Update your comparators

When things get bad, just remember: "it could be worse."
If you're feeling burned out or stressed, or if startup chaos is generally getting you down, recognizing that it almost certainly could be worse might be a helpful coping mechanism.
Assuming that you do like your work and the work your company is doing, that you enjoy working with most of your colleagues, and have a non-toxic relationship with your supervisor (or a combination of those) - basically, that you do want to stick with this job but just have to figure out how to make it less emotionally draining - then perhaps this little bit of jaded perspective could provide a helpful shift to your frame of mind.
Especially if joining a startup is one of your first jobs, as you grow and hire more people make sure to ask them about their horror stories! 
When you vent to them about what's going on, ask them to compare this situation to their prior experiences - you'll realize that your problems aren't that unique after all, and hearing that can be really validating.
You might realize that what you're experiencing is much worse than you thought, which could give you some important clarity on your situation.
You might also be surprised - this might be the best job they've ever had!
In any case, sharing horror stories helps provide important perspective that while, yes, what you're dealing with is difficult, it could likely be worse. 
And if you like enough other aspects of your job, then I found that this made it much easier to deal with the hard stuff.

# Avoiding burnout

Burnout is real. 
For me, burnout hit early and it hit hard - I was operating at above 100% for over a year, and it's taken me about the same amount of time to get back to a stable relationship with work.
As an early employee in a company experience hyper growth, you're likely going to be critical for so many different aspects of the business and of that growth, which comes with a high likelihood of burnout.
If there's a foolproof way to avoid burnout, I don't know it - but I have learned some strategies to process and recover.

First, **recognize that you can only do so many jobs, name them, and give them a percent effort.**
One of my colleagues had a mantra that I found extremely helpful: when she said no to something, or intentionally dropped the ball on something, or explicitly decided not to address a problem at work, she'd say: "I could do that, but then it would be a full-time job and I would die."
When you put it that way, the choice is easy: don't die.

I also found that naming the jobs I was doing and half-assing was really helpful.
For example, for most of 2022 I was a part-time group lead for one of the data science subteams, in addition to being a technical lead, my "actual" job.
That meant that when I felt bad for not being as good at my group lead role as the other group leads on our team, it was easier to remember that it was because group lead was only half of my job.
Early on, this actually backfired - I would start naming all of my jobs and then become overwhelmed with how many things I did and how impossible it all felt, and end up feeling worse than when I started.
But I think that if I had started naming my jobs before they piled up, it would have helped me keep tabs on my growing responsibilities, recognizing which jobs I was letting slide and which ones were critical and therefore needed to be hired for, and generally advocate for myself in more concrete ways than "I'm stressed, overworked, and burning out."

This might seem obvious in hindsight, but if you're heading into hypergrowth or toward burnout, delete all after-work notifications immediately.
Seriously - delete slack from your phone, tell your computer to not show you the slack red notification icon thingy, and even consider removing your work email from your phone.
Work intentionally and on your own terms only.
Communicate with your colleagues of course, so that they know how to reach you after hours if needed, but otherwise really try to hold yourself accountable to respecting after-work hours.
I wish I had done this much earlier, in part because I think it would have helped me get my sanity and mental health back much faster.
Perhaps more importantly, I think it would have also made it much more clear to my executive leadership just how much troubleshooting we were doing after-hours to keep our daily operations running. 

I recognize that it's really difficult to cut the cord in this way, because your identity as an early employee is likely wrapped up in the work itself.
Hustle culture tells you that you should be working all the time, which is even more true if you're an early employee.
And if you're experiencing rapid growth, then it's so exciting and you probably don't want to miss a thing.
But to grow sustainably, startups have to change their bus factors from a handful of early employees to a fully functioning and appropriately sized team. 
In fact, I believe that a key company milestone that nobody really talks about is achieving redundancy for early employees - the sooner you can get in the habit of not being critical, the sooner your company will get there.
