As Erica’s manager in the Model Risk Management department at Fannie Mae, I have had the pleasure of working with her for over a year. Erica impresses me as a young professional who has an ambitious dream for her career: being a top economist who can really contribute to the social welfare - a dream bigger than personal interest. More importantly, she has a clear plan to march towards her dream and has been persistently taking actions to achieve her plan. Her quantitative competence, her creativity and curiosity for new things, and her ability to make a broader impact beyond her immediate team, all equip her for pursuing her career dream. I believe that being granted the NSF will be a milestone of her career path and will give her more opportunities for self-development.   
Erica came to Fannie Mae through a very selective Analytical Associate program. The program recruits college graduates through a rigorous screening and interview process, focusing on applicants’ quantitative skills,  their ability to quickly learn and grasp new techniques, and their potential of thinking big, being creative, and making a real difference in American’s housing finance system. After being accepted to this program, Erica and her peers went through a 3-month intensive training program that focuses on two main aspects: using programing languages effectively such as SAS, R, Python to process data and solve real business problems; and understanding the housing finance system. This program not only prepared Erica for the work she subsequently does one my team, but also helped build a very solid foundation of quantitative skill and resilience for her future Ph.D. study in Economics.
After graduating from the Associates training program, Erica joined my team. Her main responsibility is to validate the theorical and analytical soundness of econometric models used for Fannie Mae’s residential mortgage business. This job requires a deep understanding of economic and econometric theories, and the ability to conduct hands-on empirical analysis on big data sets. Advanced degrees in Economics or Statistics are typically required for such jobs. With her excellent quantitative and programing skills, Erica has successfully completed several validation projects with limited supervision. She has provided valuable insights to each project she works on. 
For example, Erica independently validated a model that examines the behaviors of a special group of borrowers with relatively low income and less down payment. Fannie Mae designed a program to support these borrowers, and evaluated the effectiveness of the program with an econometric model comparing the delinquency patterns of these borrowers against similar borrowers not in the program. Erica explored a variety of model specifications to control the differences between the borrowers in vs. not in the program and confirmed the conclusion of the original model: the program does improve the borrowers’ ability to stay current on their mortgages. Erica did not stop there. She went a step further to develop supplementary models that help to explore why this program is effective. The insight gained from this project helped Fannie Mae to design more effective instruments to support sustainable homeownership. 
Erica also participated the review of a highly complex system of econometric models used to project the loan-level cash flow for all residential mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae. Erica played several roles in this review: verifying the code of the calculation engine; validating the results projected from the system; and benchmarking model projections against historical outcomes. She collaborated effectively with other team members to gain a thorough understanding about the model structure; identified many deficiencies of the proposed system; and worked with the owner of the system to fix the deficiencies. Her work was highly appreciated by the owner of the calculation engine, and multiple awards were given to her to recognize her contribution.   [Could you also briefly mention CCFA just to give a sense of the complexity of projects I have also worked on / my ability to work well on a team? You could probably stay very high level about the project and just say it was a highly complex cash flow model etc.]
Besides Erica’s regular work as a model validation associate, she engages in activities that influence Fannie Mae’s broader modeling and analytical community. She has focused on developing her leadership skill; from Oct. 2018 to Mar. 2018, she completed a six-month Emerging Leaders training program that develops the next generation of leaders within Fannie Mae. She has actively demonstrated the leadership, communication, and problem solving skills she had built through the activities in which she has participated. For example, she led the issuance of Fannie Mae’s Model Risk Management Newsletter which was distributed to more than a hundred of analytical leads across the company. From selecting topics, assembling material, to the final publication, Erica works with people from multiple teams to make sure the newsletter covers model risk topics concerning Fannie Mae’s broad analytical community, and the contents are informative and intriguing. This is one of many activities that demonstrate her ability to connect dots and lead people to work on a goal that benefits a broad community. 
Behind her excellent quantitative skill and her ability to make a broad impact, it is her curiosity and her aptitude for grasping new skills that drive her success. She is constantly learning new things- taking online Machine Learning courses and college math courses; participating Fannie Mae’s Machine Learning Hackathon; studying residential mortgage option pricing in traditional and state-of-art literature; talking to established economists such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s Chief Economists; attending Risk America and other conferences, … she is never tired of learning and bettering herself. Donating to charities; volunteering to help  homeless people… she works hard for a very good reason, and her genuine care for a better world will take her very far. 
I am so glad to witness Erica’s competence and her rapid growth during her one-year tenure in Fannie Mae. With her great intention, her enthusiasm, and her intellectual merits, nothing can stop her from pursuing her dream of being a top economist. I strongly support her application of the NSF and believe that the fund will be the catalyst to the realization of her dream.
