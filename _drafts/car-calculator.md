- Target audience is people who can choose (i) whether they buy a new car now or later and (ii) what car they will buy.
- I treat car use as inelastic: there must be a fixed number of cars on the road at any given time.
- In particular, I ignore the possibility that someone might *not* buy a car.
- Cars age and are recycled after their full lifetime.
- But now this gets confusing, because it limits the total number of cars that can be produced. To keep the number of cars fixed, we know exactly when a new car will be bought. Doesn't quite add up. Elasticity is really important here!
- The simple model is to say that, for an individual, does it help or hurt *their* carbon footprint to buy a new car.
- This comes down to something relatively simple: given the difference in fuel efficiency, and the initial carbon cost of building the new car, what's the break-even point?
- But this ignores the fact that by buying a new car and using it, the price declines, so that someone can afford a relatively new (and hopefully efficient) car for less money.
- This is analogous logic to Cash for Clunkers: give people who own poor-efficiency cars a bit of extra cash so they can trade up. The equivalence here is that you reduce the price of the new car, rather than give extra cash for the old car.
- So maybe the way to think about it is, if you are buying a more fuel efficient car, then you are paying some part of price of it being new (rather than used) as a donation toward improving overall energy efficiency. By buying a fuel efficient car, you are making it cheaper to buy a fuel efficient car.
- How much does this market force compare with things like not driving as much?
