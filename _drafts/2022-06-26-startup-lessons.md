The past two years have been a wild ride, both professionally and personally.
I'm excited to now be in a place where I have the space and energy to reflect on my experience over the past two years being an early employee at a startup that exploded over the past two years.
We grew from 5 people to over 100, working with one small city to having a multi-million dollar contract with the CDC in all 50 states, supporting one product to over 10, and sending one report per month to hundreds per day - it's been a lot!

And I've learned a lot, but most of it has come the hard way.
The past two years have been among the most difficult in my life - yes, a large part of it was the pandemic and the acute experience of our public health systems failing us, but a large part of it was also work.
In order to support our company's growth, a *lot* was put on my shoulders - getting out from under that weight, and learning to function in the new company we've become, has been challenging to say the least.

Now that I'm in a good spot and able to reflect on the past two years, I've realized that there aren't a whole lot of resources out there to support *early employees* on their specific startup journey.
If you're a founder, there are many fellowships, accelerators, and communities that you can participate in that'll teach you the nuts and bolts of founding a company *and also* give you a peek into the emotional rollercoaster you're about to embark on.
These networks provide founders with a community of peers they can reach out to for support, and perhaps even equip them with some strategies to navigate the journey and make it less draining.

But I haven't seen similar resources targeted for early employees and their experiences.
Googling "early employee startup" brings up a handful of blog posts, but they're primarily focused on strategies to maximize your work output and on the gamble of joining an early startup but potentially superboosting your career growth.
If the emotional management piece is mentioned at all, it's as an aside: "oh, being an early employee is an emotional rollercoaster so make sure you're ready to handle it."
But *how* to handle it isn't discussed - and the gap is even more apparent if you don't subscribe to the "work your ass off overtime, make your startup job your whole life" mentality.

If you're an early employee at a startup struggling to figure out how to scale with your company while maintaining your sanity and work-life balance, or if you're already so burned out that you *can't* keep hustling but you also don't want to quit just yet, there doesn't seem to be much out there for you.
(If there is, *please* point me to it!!)
I now understand that I went into my job completely uninformed, totally swayed by all of the "joining a startup as an early employee is hard, but <1000 word blog post about all the ways it can be amazing for your career>".
So I wanted to write down some of the lessons I've learned along the way.

I'll caveat all of this with the requisite disclaimer that these are my personal experiences, and that things that work for me may not work for you.
Even within my own company, each early employee has taken a unique path, and likely learned different things from their journeys.
It's also important to note that this is my first job out of grad school, and my founders were also fresh out of academia when they started the company.
So it's possible that what I'm about to share is obvious for anybody who's had a job before, but I also know there are a lot of people in my shoes - excited to take a chance and join a startup they're passionate about right after finishing grad school.

Keep your arms and legs inside the ride at all times, folks - it's gonna be bumpy!

# Coping with the coaster

_Sometime last year, an advisor told me that one of the most useful tidbits he'd gotten about being in a startup was that the "roller coaster" description of startups isn't quite right - it's not really that you go up and down and up and down. When a startup is growing, the highs are higher and the lows are lower. It's less of a roller coaster, and more of a sine wave with increasing amplitude. Somehow, this comforted me._ (Not sure where this paragraph goes)

Building organizations is not something that humans have figured out yet. Unless you have exceptional founders (and even if you do), organizational and systemic failures will abound as your company grows.
This is especially true if you're experiencing hyper growth - there's just no way to grow that fast without dropping _some_ balls related to company health.

My company's dropped balls with respect to organizational health and culture hit me especially hard.
(As an aside, I recently realized that it was extra hard because of my politics, which are focused on society's systemic issues rather than the symptoms of those issues.
With this worldview, it's been really hard for me to view failures that could be seen as small and one-off - say, a flopped communication or inconsistent prioritizations - as small, because I immediatey try to go to the underlying problems that cause it.
But it's been so important to not let that perspective win and drain me, otherwise I'd be screaming into the void of dissatisfaction and be a real big buzzkill to work with.)

What's helped me cope is the realization that **unless you're the founder, you can't change the company**.
This has been _the most_ important thing for me to internalize as I've navigated my company's growth.
As the company grows, the founders decide everything, including how much impact non-founders can have on the company itself.
If they want to bring you in to large decisions where you have a seat at the table, great.
But if they don't, there's nothing you can do about it.
And that's ok!
There are many valid phenotypes of founder, and at the end of the day the founders are the ones who decide what type of company they're building.
You're just an employee.

Now, of course, you don't have _zero_ ability to change the company, in fact you have quite a lot!
You just can't make fundamental changes to the company as a whole, unless the founders are also actively on board.
I joined my startup in part because I was really excited to help shape the type of company we'd become.
When I realized that I wasn't going to be able to exert influence on company-wide organizational culture, I really struggled.
If I'd known going into my job that "shaping the culture" is _also_ a gamble that may not pan out, I think I would have struggled a lot less.

One strategy I've picked up which has helped me deal with situations where I'm frustrated about something that's out of my control is to **focus on the baby step, not the toddler step**.
When something happens and I get grumpy because that thing could have been done so much better, instead of focusing on how it could be better (which is how things would be, if we were a toddler company), I try to focus instead of the fact that the thing was done at all (which is the first "baby" step we're at).
For example, if an important announcement is communicated poorly (in my opinion), rather than focusing on how poor the communication was, I try to reframe and emphasize that it was communicated _at all_!
Communicating _well_ is the toddler step; communicating at all is the baby step I'm celebrating instead.

# Making change

Being an early employee at a growing startup puts you at a really interesting nexus of influence.
On the one hand, your opinions have more weight than the average employee because of your long tenure and broad context.
On the other hand, folks with more seniority and different expertise are being hired above and around you, and there are more and more layers between you and the founders.
So making change goes from swiveling your chair to chat with the CEO sitting right there to a strategic and diplomatic endeavor.
For the first 6-12 months of our hypergrowth, I really struggled with this - I felt like I was wailing into the void about all the things that were wrong and that we needed to change, to no effect.
But as we've grown our team and hired some colleagues who are much more skilled diplomats than I am, I've picked up a couple of strategies to make change effectively in a growing organization.

Most importantly, **the change you make must begin within your sphere of influence** - the people and teams over whom you have influence, and not the ones outside your reach.
As an early employee, your sphere of influence was the whole company.
But as you've grown, it's changed - likely now it's just your team, maybe the team adjacent to yours, plus a few additional colleagues who you have strong relationships with.
It can be painful to see this dynamic and feel like your sphere of influence is shrinking - but it's not!
Yes, you've gone from having influence over 100% of the company to, say, 20% - which is a large number becoming smaller.
But actually, it's more likely that you've gone from having influence over 5 people to 25 - a 5x increase!

That's what happened to me - in the early phases of our hypergrowth I maintained my influence over the majority of our growing company because I was handling so many aspects of the day-to-day work we were doing.
The founders were the first to leave my sphere of influence, as they focused on capitalizing on this moment to supercharge our company's growth.
But as we grew, I still had opinions on how our non-technical teams were growing, how I thought we should be changing our market strategy, and so much more - all things which I had no authority over, and more imnportantly, all things which were under the purview of people outside my sphere of influence.
In contrast, as our data science team grew to 15 people, I've maintained substantial influence over how our team works togehter and what our culture would become.
In fact, our transparent, collaborative, and positive culture is my proudest professional achievement so far. :D

When it comes to other teams that I'm not explicitly on, making change is **all about the personal relationships**.
Before we had distinctive teams, my influence came from my close relationships with the lab operations folks who had started around the same time as me, as well as my technical colleagues in software and data.
Even now that we do have distinct teams, the relationships still carry the most impact.
Even with my closest sister team, sofware engineering, the primary way that I have influence is through my very close working relationship with their leader and some key senior ICs who started before we had a full-fledged software team.

A concrete example from my experience is how our teams approach async communication: I'm a big fan of frequent public communication in slack channels, and of sharing unfinished work early and often.
Other teams at my company have a different culture, and early on that drove me absolutely crazy.
But I'm not in their team meetings, I'm not involved in hiring, and I don't get a say in the culture they're building - so it's pointless to get upset or try to change it, when it's so far outside my sphere of influence.
All I can do is slowly nudge folks in that direction through one on one conversations.
On my team, in contrast - I explicitly ask about communication in interviews, collaboration is one of our team values, and we force folks to share unfinished work as part of their onboarding, thereby setting everybody off on the same foot.
It's been very effective, but only because my team is squarely within my sphere of influence.

So what about changing things outside your sphere of influence, is that a hopeless endeavor?
Well, yes and no - you probably can't do it directly, but you aren't powerless to influence your orgnaization.
That's because **grassroots efforts can lead to organizational impact**.
Even though you can't change how the whole organization works, doing something really well within your own little world can resonate more broadly.
It's possible that other teams will become ready to tackle an issue that you've already solved, and come to you for inspiration or advice.
Alternatively, folks may notice aspects of your team functioning better than theirs, and reach out to learn how.
It can be less satisfying than directly wielding influence because you have to wait for other teams to be ready and - in many cases - to reach out, but that's honestly the best you can do.
You can't force anyone to change who isn't ready to, or convince anyone to listen to you who doesn't want to.
I have a handful of great examples to point to here, from the data science team's onboarding document (which itself was inspired by the simple existence of the software team's doc) becoming the template for teams across our organization, to a key cross-team training inspiring other teams to think about formalizing their own cross-team interactions.

Finally, **timing is everything** when it comes to making change in a growing organization.
Just because you have all the best ideas for how to grow a team or take your product to market doesn't mean anything if the timing isn't right.
Maybe there isn't enough personnel and bandwidth to implement your idea, or  you haven't built up enough conviction for your idea among the right stakeholders, or maybe there's just some external forces you don't see holding progress back - if you keep hammering away at your idea in an unreceptive environment, you won't get what you want and in the process you'll drive yourself mad and likely frustrate your colleagues too.
This is especially important to recognize if you're in a period of hypergrowth - there will be _so many_ things that could be handled so much better, but it's likely just so chaotic that folks are already at their max and doing the best they can.
It's hard and it sucks, but you just have to be patient.
Luckily, there are so many things you can be doing right now - so it's important to recognize when the timing isn't right, and refocus your energy on things that you CAN achieve *in the current moment*.

So basically, this section of how to make change at a growing organization was also a lot about all the ways you _can't_ make change in the organization.
But knowing what you can't do is important to stop wasting energy on sysyphean tasks and instead refocus towards approaches that have a chance of achieving impact: starting small and biding your time, with the hopes that your local impact will ripple outwards and upwards to the rest of your organization.




# Avoiding burnout

On a personal level,

- recognize that you can only do so many jobs
  - when saying no/dropping the ball on things: "I could do that, but then it would be a full-time job and I would die"
  - when half-assing a job, name it! i am half group lead for data ops, and so when i feel bad for not being as good as my other co-group leads, i remember that it is bc it is only half of my job
- delete all notifications
  - seriously, no slack notification thingy, delete slack from your phone, etc
  - i wish i had done this earlier, bc it would have (1) given me my sanity back faster and (2) made it more clear to my executive leadership just how much after-hours troubleshooting there was on our janky pipeline (maybe remove this)
  - difficult, bc identity is wrapped up in it. hustle culture tells you that you should be working all the time. But to grow sustainably, startups have to stop relying on their early employees. I now believe that achieving redundancy or early employees is a critical company milestone that nobody talks about.




# Update your comparators

Unlike at the beginning of the startup, when there were what felt like a million possible paths for the company to take, as it grows it necessarily narrows the options available.

- Always remember: "it could be worse"
  - (ofc, this is assuming that you do like your work, enjoy working with most of your colleagues, have a positive relationship with your supervisor, etc - basically, that you do want to stick with this job you just have to figure out how to make it less emotionally draining)
  - but actually, it almost certainly could be worse
  - a benefit of growing & hiring more people: ask them about their horror stories! when you vent to them, ask them to compare this situation to their prior experiences. it'll probably help: your problems likely aren't unique (so if they say they've experienced it before that's validating) and could also likely be much much worse

- divest yourself from the mission (a little bit)
  - as an early employee, you were likely part of conversations about big dreams and ideas of where this company could go
  - the reality of building a company is that you're likely now quite far from those dreams, which - again - you can't do anything about bc that's the founder's job
  - you'll feel the pain of your company's shortcomings more acutely than your colleagues bc you have the strongest comparator. you gotta let it go, otherwise you will be sad and frustrated all the time.
    - you don't have access to all the many timelines, you only have access to the one you're in.
    - when you're early stage, alllll of those other timelines are available to you. as you grow, you start to pick one and go down it. you can't keep looking to your side at the other timelines you're not on, they're not available anymore. you just gotta focus on the one you're on, see its merits, and put your efforts toward making THAT one the best it can be

- yes, i'm saying to lower your standards -- this is all part of changing your attitude to seeing this as a job. a great job, but still just a job nonetheless.
