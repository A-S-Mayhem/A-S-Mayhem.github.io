I now have the space and energy to reflect on my experience over the past two years, being an early employee at a startup that exploded over the past two years, going from: 5 people to over 100, working with one small city to having a multi-million dollar contract with the CDC, supporting one product to over 10, and sending one report per month to hundreds per day - we've grown a lot!

And I've learned a lot, but most of it has come the hard way. The past two years have been among the most difficult in my life - yes, a large part of it was the pandemic and the acute experience of our public health systems failing us, but a large part of it was also work. In order to support that growth, a *lot* was put on my shoulders - getting out from under that weight, and learning to function in the new company we've become, has been challenging to say the least.

Now that I'm in a good spot and able to reflect on the past two years, I've realized that there aren't a whole lot of resources out there to support *early employees* on their specific startup journey. If you're a founder, there are many fellowships, accelerators, and communities that you can participate in that'll teach you the nuts and bolts of founding a company *and also* give you a peek into the emotional rollercoaster you're about to embark on. These networks provide founders with a network of peers they can reach out to for support, and perhaps even equip them with some strategies to navigate the journey and make it less draining.

But I haven't seen similar resources targeted for early employees and their experiences. Googling "early employee startup" does get you a handful of blog posts, but they're primarily focused on strategies to maximize your work output, superboost your career growth, and scale with your startup. If the emotional management piece is mentioned at all, it's as an aside: "oh, being an early employee is an emotional rollercoaster so make sure you're ready to handle it." But *how* to handle it isn't discussed - and the gap is even more apparent if you don't subscribe to the "work your ass off, make your whole startup your life" mentality.

If you're an early employee at a startup struggling to figure out how to scale with your company while maintaining your sanity and work-life balance, or if you're already so burned out that you *can't* keep hustling but you also don't want to quit just yet, there doesn't seem to be much out there for you. (If there is, *please* point me to it!!) I now understand that I went into my job completely uninformed, totally swayed by all of the "joining a startup as an early employee is hard, but <1000 word blog post about all the ways it can be amazing for your career>". So I wanted to write down some of the lessons I've learned along the way.

Keep your arms and legs inside the ride at all times, folks - it's gonna be bumpy!

# Coping with the coaster

_Sometime last year, an advisor told me that one of the most useful tidbits he'd gotten about being in a startup was that the "roller coaster" description of startups isn't quite right - it's not really that you go up and down and up and down. When a startup is growing, the highs are higher and the lows are lower. It's less of a roller coaster, and more of a sine wave with increasing amplitude. Somehow, this comforted me._ (Not sure where this paragraph goes)

Building organizations is not something that humans have figured out yet. Unless you have exceptional founders (and even then, I'm doubtful), organizational and systemic failures will abound as your company grows. This is especially true if you're experiencing hyper growth - there's just no way to grow that fast without dropping _some_ balls related to company health.

This hit me especially hard - as an aside, I actually realized that it's extra hard because of my politics, which focus on the systemic issues that lead to the symptoms we experience. With this worldview, it's been really hard for me to brush anything away as one-off when I see the underlying problems that have caused it. But I've had to get over it, otherwise I'd be screaming into the void of dissatisfaction and be a real big buzzkill to work with.

But **unless you're the founder, you can't change the company**. This has been _the most_ important thing for me to internalize as I've navigated my company's growth. As the company grows, the founders decide everything, including how much impact you can have on the company itself. If they want to bring you in to large decisions where you have a seat at the table, great. But if they don't, there's nothing you can do about it. And that's ok! There are many valid phenotypes of founder, and at the end of the day the founders are the ones who decide what type of company they're building. You're just an employee. Now, of course, you don't have _zero_ ability to change the company, in fact you have quite a lot! (See "Making change" below) You just can't make fundamental changes to the company as a whole, unless the founders are also actively on board. I joined my startup in part because I was really excited to help shape the type of company we'd become. When I realized that I wasn't going to be able to exert influence on company-wide organizational culture, I really struggled. If I'd known going into my job that "shaping the culture" is _also_ a gamble that may not pan out, I think I would have struggled a lot less.

One strategy I've picked up which has helped me deal with situations where I'm frustrated about something that's out of my control is to **focus on the baby step, not the toddler step**. When something happens and I get grumpy because that thing could have been done so much better, instead of focusing on how it could be better (which is how things would be, if we were a toddler company), I try to focus instead of the fact that the thing was done at all (which is the first "baby" step we're at). For example, if an important announcement is communicated poorly (in my opinion), rather than focus on how poor the communication was, I try to reframe and emphasize that it was communicated _at all_! Communicating _well_ is the toddler step; communicating at all is the baby step I'm celebrating instead.

# Avoiding burnout

On a personal level, 

- recognize that you can only do so many jobs
  - when saying no/dropping the ball on things: "I could do that, but then it would be a full-time job and I would die"
  - when half-assing a job, name it! i am half group lead for data ops, and so when i feel bad for not being as good as my other co-group leads, i remember that it is bc it is only half of my job
- delete all notifications
  - seriously, no slack notification thingy, delete slack from your phone, etc
  - i wish i had done this earlier, bc it would have (1) given me my sanity back faster and (2) made it more clear to my executive leadership just how much after-hours troubleshooting there was on our janky pipeline (maybe remove this)

# Making change

- start in your sphere of influence  
  - on your team
  - if you don't have a team, with your closest colleagues
- evangelize grassroots efforts
  - if you do something well, it will likely get adopted by others
  - our team's onboarding has become template for the company's
- timing is everything: even if you have the best idea, if the timing isn't right then nothing will come of it. recognize that, and focus your energy on things that you CAN achieve, *in the current moment*


# Team building & leadership

- junior hires
  - be careful with junior hires - you probably don't need them yet
  - but don't be too careful: if your work is repetitive, it's probably not that special & can be trained away
- senior hires
  - dear god do not wait to make a senior/leadership hire before getting an IC
  - if you have too many direct reports, change the reporting structure but make it clear that it's temporary
    - eg i had 3 direct reports who were all more senior than me in different ways. that period was hard, but it was better than not having them
    - now we're all colleagues and I love it
- communicate about how you communicate
  - in remote environment
  - at biobot, we have fun things like "pulling a claire" or "pulling a scott"
- if this is one of your first jobs outside of school, don't be in a rush to get a "head of" or director title
  - give yourself space to discover what you actually like
  - i learned that i actually *don't* like (and am less effective at) a lot of the politics and relationship-leveraging needed to play an important strategic role. but because I was given the space to NOT be head of data science, i discovered that i DO love being a technical leader, and that's where i've been thriving. (it also meant that we got to hire a head of data science who i've learned so much from, from a career & personal growth perspective)
- you're still a leader, act like it
  - just by having been around a long time, you'll still be a leader - you know the context, you have all the scoops, you see the big picture. new folks will be excited to learn from you regardless of your actual role
  - your opinion will matter a lot, so be careful with it. as our company has grown larger and larger, i've made much more use of DMs - to share feedback  privately that in early days I would have put in a channel, to strategize a response to a tricky situation, to make sure i'm not overstepping on somebody else's work
- let go of your legos
  - obvi a post about a growing startup isn't complete without a "let go of your legos" reference
  - but really, it's so important to be intentional about giving other people space to take over things that used to be your job
  - importantly, it's very likely that they will do a worse job of it than you! they don't have the full context you do or the years of experience. but you *have* to let them take it, and make it their own. (1) there is often no "best" way to do something, and it's possible that they'll take your hacked-together solution and make it better, since it's their entire job to do that. also (2) whatever we lose by the mistakes or "less good" job they do, we gain by having a reduced bus factor. it's worth having a slightly less-accurate QC process, if it means we can hire junior data analysts to do it instead of a physics PhD...

# Update your comparators

Unlike at the beginning of the startup, when there were what felt like a million possible paths for the company to take, as it grows it necessarily narrows the options available.


- Always remember: "it could be worse"
  - (ofc, this is assuming that you do like your work, enjoy working with most of your colleagues, have a positive relationship with your supervisor, etc - basically, that you do want to stick with this job you just have to figure out how to make it less emotionally draining)
  - but actually, it almost certainly could be worse
  - a benefit of growing & hiring more people: ask them about their horror stories! when you vent to them, ask them to compare this situation to their prior experiences. it'll probably help: your problems likely aren't unique (so if they say they've experienced it before that's validating) and could also likely be much much worse

 - divest yourself from the mission (a little bit)
    - as an early employee, you were likely part of conversations about big dreams and ideas of where this company could go
    - the reality of building a company is that you're likely now quite far from those dreams, which - again - you can't do anything about bc that's the founder's job
    - you'll feel the pain of your company's shortcomings more acutely than your colleagues bc you have the strongest comparator. you gotta let it go, otherwise you will be sad and frustrated all the time.
      - you don't have access to all the many timelines, you only have access to the one you're in.
      - when you're early stage, alllll of those other timelines are available to you. as you grow, you start to pick one and go down it. you can't keep looking to your side at the other timelines you're not on, they're not available anymore. you just gotta focus on the one you're on, see its merits, and put your efforts toward making THAT one the best it can be

 - yes, i'm saying to lower your standards -- this is all part of changing your attitude to seeing this as a job. a great job, but still just a job nonetheless.
