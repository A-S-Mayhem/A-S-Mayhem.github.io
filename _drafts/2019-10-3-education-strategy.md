In my job I've been working a lot on strategic planning. A key part of
strategic work is separating *strategy* from *tactics*. Incidentally, at the
same time as working on this topic at work, I was reading a history of the
Punic Wars, the series of conflicts between ancient Rome and Carthage, [written
by Nigel Bagnall](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Punic_Wars.html?id=W9u9mCSV4AgC),
a British general, who recasts the history of the wars like a general would,
asking about each sides, strategy and tactics.

There are dozens of schema for strategy/tactics jargon. A popular one is *MOST*:

- **M**ission: Broadly, where are we trying to go?
- **O**bjectives: What are concrete, quantitative goalposts in that direction?
- **S**trategy: What kinds of activities do we undertake to hit those
  objectives?
- **T**actics: What are the details of those activities?

So for Hannibal, the most famous Carthaginian general, in the Second Punic War,
this analysis might go:

- Mission: Prevent Rome from encroaching on Carthage's lucrative trading
  colonies.
- Objectives: Rome withdraws all legions from Sicily, Spain, Sardinia, and
  Illyria (modern Croatia).
- Strategy: Cause Rome's Italian allies to defect, and Gauls to invade Italy
  from the north, forcing Rome to defend itself locally.
- Tactics: March a Carthaginian army from Spain over the Alps to Italy, fight
  battles, etc.

At the same time, I also started thinking about educational targets. Both in
school and in other educational contexts ---I'm at a medical conference right
now--- I've see stated "learning objectives" more and more often. It seems
reasonable that stating the learning objectives is a way to ground-truth
whether the curriculum is successful.

I think it is striking, however, how far down the MOST analysis "learning
objectives" lie. I think of a curriculum as a battle, a single encounter.
