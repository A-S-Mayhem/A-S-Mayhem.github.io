# Team building & leadership - this might be its own post

## Building the team

- junior hires
  - be careful with junior hires - you probably don't need them yet
  - but don't be too careful: if your work is repetitive, it's probably not that special & can be trained away
- senior hires
  - dear god do not wait to make a senior/leadership hire before getting an IC
  - if you have too many direct reports, change the reporting structure but make it clear that it's temporary
    - eg i had 3 direct reports who were all more senior than me in different ways. that period was hard, but it was better than not having them. it also wasn't that hard, bc even before we were colleagues I treated them as such - from a management, prioritization, and "what is hte company doing?" perspective I was their manager; but from a "what should I be doing to achieve this gola" and "how should I do it?" I let them lead 100%
    - now we're all colleagues and I love it

## Building the culture

- communicate about how you communicate
  - in remote environment
  - accountability: talk about it continuously, and enforce the norms when you start to deviate. (When someone asks "is this the right channel to post this in?" - answer their question!)
  - at biobot, we have fun things like "pulling a claire" or "pulling a scott"
- provide intentional tasks during onboarding
  - 30-60-90 is nice, but realistically you only need to plan for like 30 days. after a month, things will probably have changed enough that a new path has become clear
  - onboarding is the moment to create the culture! "make a plot!" is my favorite onboarding task, and we made sure that our director of DS did it too :D
- model the behavior you want from your colleagues, esp with your co-leaders (meh)
  - I want small talk when zoom meetings start, so I try to small talk!
  -
- give your rationale / explain the "why" behind what you're doing (to build an engaged team)
  - you'll probably feel like a broken record, but that's how it'll stick
  - nothing better than hearing one of your colleagues - especially someone junior! - connect the dots themselves, take that extra step because they understand the big picture behind what they're doing.

## Your changing role in the team

- you're still a leader, act like it
  - just by having been around a long time, you'll still be a leader - you know the context, you have all the scoops, you see the big picture. new folks will be excited to learn from you regardless of your actual role
  - your opinion will matter a lot, so be careful with it. as our company has grown larger and larger, i've made much more use of DMs - to share feedback  privately that in early days I would have put in a channel, to strategize a response to a tricky situation, to make sure i'm not overstepping on somebody else's work
- let go of your legos
  - obvi a post about a growing startup isn't complete without a "let go of your legos" reference
  - but really, it's so important to be intentional about giving other people space to take over things that used to be your job
  - importantly, it's very likely that they will do a worse job of it than you! they don't have the full context you do or the years of experience. but you *have* to let them take it, and make it their own. (1) there is often no "best" way to do something, and it's possible that they'll take your hacked-together solution and make it better, since it's their entire job to do that. also (2) whatever we lose by the mistakes or "less good" job they do, we gain by having a reduced bus factor. it's worth having a slightly less-accurate QC process, if it means we can hire junior data analysts to do it instead of a physics PhD...
- if this is one of your first jobs outside of school, don't be in a rush to get a "head of" or director title
  - give yourself space to discover what you actually like
  - i learned that i actually *don't* like (and am less effective at) a lot of the politics and relationship-leveraging needed to play an important strategic role. but because I was given the space to NOT be head of data science, i discovered that i DO love being a technical leader, and that's where i've been thriving. (it also meant that we got to hire a head of data science who i've learned so much from, from a career & personal growth perspective)
- inflection points
  - you're alone
  - you're not alone but you're in charge
  - someone else is in charge
  - your team is larger than you directly control
