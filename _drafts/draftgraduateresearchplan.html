Evaluating the Impact of Homebuyer Education and Financial Benefits on Loan Performance for Low Income Borrowers
On average, the homeownership rate for low income individuals is 15 percentage points lower than the national rate.  Additionally, low income homeowners experience higher mortgage default rates, with the lowest income groups experiencing the highest default rates.  Homebuyer education and counseling (HEC) programs are designed to help low and moderate income borrowers to navigate the homebuying process, increase the financial literacy and consequentially, reduce default rates. However, 62% of all defaults are due to a borrower’s inability to pay, half of whom would not be able to consume at a subsistence level if they paid their mortgage.  While increased financial literacy can improve budgeting and saving habits, it cannot prevent a negative income shock from happening. Typically, HEC programs are evaluated by comparing default rates using data from the down payment assistance programs which do not provide financial benefits beyond the initial home purchase. And from the results of previous studies, the impact of HEC programs is unclear. I propose evaluating HomeReady, an affordable mortgage product offered by Fannie Mae, to understand the impact of homebuyer education on delinquency related outcomes when paired with a continuous financial benefit and how to design more effective HEC and mortgage assistance programs.  
Proposal Summary: HomeReady® Mortgages
Started in 2015, HomeReady is Fannie Mae’s affordable mortgage offered to households with income at or below 80% of their area’s median income (AMI) with at least one borrower who has completed homebuyer education. The HomeReady program is unique in that there are caps on loan level price adjustments (LLPA). Mortgage lenders can keep the reduced LLPA benefit as profit or pass on the benefit by giving borrowers a better rate. This allows for the comparison between three groups: (1) borrowers who have been eligible for HomeReady based on their income but did not participate or receive HEC, (2) HomeReady borrowers whose rate at origination is at or above the market rate, and (3) HomeReady borrowers whose rate at origination is below the market rate and who thus enjoy a financial benefit in addition to HEC. I propose evaluating the impact of HEC alone and combined with a financial benefit on delinquency using quasi-experimental methods  DO I THOUGH to better understand the role of financial literacy in delinquency and payment choices for low income households and to provide design improvements for mortgage assistance and modification programs.
Methodology: 
Merging acquisition data containing borrower and loan characteristic information with performance data allows me to build a payment history and credit profile for each loan. Using this information, I can construct binary response variables indicating early delinquency (going 90 days delinquent within the first 6 months/year/2 years etc), delinquency cure rates (after going 90 days delinquent, did they make up the payments), and modification rates. Early delinquency can be used as a proxy for default risk given that going seriously delinquent is a precursor to default. Delinquency cure rates and modification rates are possibly noisy proxies for financial literacy of a borrower, given that a financially savvy borrower more likely to establish a budget for making up payments or pursue modification options available to them. I propose several logistic regressions to explore the effect of HEC and HEC combined with financial incentives:
Y= a + b HR + c SATO + f HR * SATO + dX + e
Where Y is one of the response variables defined above, X is a vector of borrower and loan characteristics at time of acquisition, HR is a binary indicator of whether a loan is a part of the HomeReady program, SATO is the note rate spread at time of origination, and HR * SATO is an interaction effect for HomeReady and SATO. NOTE DO I NEED TO INCLUDE ALL 3 OR COULD I DROP SATO? This specification identifies the causal effect of a better rate for HomeReady loans, assuming that the improved rate is not correlated with an unobserved characteristic that also impacts delinquency, curing, or modification. 
Resources/Considerations:
The ideal dataset for performing this analysis would be the internal Fannie Mae loan-level monthly performance data which can be requested for academic purposes. If that data is unavailable, the external acquisition and performance data can be used to build a loan history. In addition, there could be bias due to more sophisticated individuals self-selecting into HEC programs, and a propensity score adjustment should be tested to correct for selection bias. It is also worth noting that there is a limited history of the product given that it started in 2015, this limits the ability to understand the impact of HEC later in the loan lifecycle. Additionally, the economic conditions since 2015 have been favorable, so the results from this study may not be consistent in adverse economic conditions.
