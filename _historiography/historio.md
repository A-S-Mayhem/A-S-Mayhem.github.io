1960s
======
In the 1960s, when the field of Computer Science was emerging, some practitioners wrote encyclopedic histories and organized individual programming languages chronologically. Representative works from this period include Saul Rosen's *Programming Systems and Languages* (McGraw-Hill, 1967) and Jean E. Sammet's *Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals* (Prentice Hall, 1969). The latter comprehensively describes the technical aspects of the development of 116 programming languages up to the mid-1960s. This work was one of the reasons for the large number of historical studies of programming languages in later years.
