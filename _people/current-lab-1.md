### Sarah P. Flanagan

<img align="left" src='/images/IMG_20190717_152944_exported_932_1570595349060.jpg' height='266' width='200'> Dr. Sarah Flanagan is a Lecturer in Evolutionary Biology in the [School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/biological-sciences/) in Christchurch, New Zealand. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Colby College in Waterville, Maine, USA in 2011. In 2016 she completed her PhD in Biology with [Adam Jones](https://pipefishguysite.wordpress.com/) at Texas A&M University, and then was a postdoctoral fellow at the [National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis](http://www.nimbios.org/) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

Sarah's research focuses on the evolution of complex traits and how selection interacts with the genome. The lab's research activities fall into two major categories: (1) understanding how sexual selection acts on traits and shapes mating systems and (2) investigating the genomic basis of traits, including the signature selection leaves on the genome. Read more about Sarah on her [personal website]( https://sarahpflanagan.wordpress.com/), where she maintains a blog.


### Lucy Howell

<img align="right" src='/images/lucyhowell.png' width="40%" height="40%"> Lucy is working towards a Masters in Antarctic Studies and is developing an environmental DNA pipeline that can be used 'on the ice' in Antarctica. At the moment she is focused on extracting Weddell seal DNA from snow samples. She is co-supervised by Sarah and [Michelle LaRue](https://www.drmichellelarue.com/).

### Fleur van Eyndhoven

<img align="right" src='/images/fleurvaneyndhoven.jpg' width="40%" height="40%"> Fleur is working towards a Master of Science in biological sciences looking at sexual selection in the wide-bodied pipefish, <i>Stigmatopora nigra</i>. She is interested in animal behaviour and how individuals interact with each other.
