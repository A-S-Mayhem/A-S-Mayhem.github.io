### Sarah P. Flanagan

Dr. Sarah Flanagan is a Lecturer in Evolutionary Biology in the School of Biological Sciences. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Colby College in Waterville, Maine, USA in 2011. In 2016 she completed her PhD in Biology with [Adam Jones](https://pipefishguysite.wordpress.com/) at Texas A&M University, and then was a postdoctoral fellow at the [National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis](http://www.nimbios.org/) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

My research focuses on the evolution of complex traits and how selection interacts with the genome. My research activities fall into two major categories: (1) understanding how sexual selection acts on traits and shapes mating systems and (2) investigating the genomic basis of traits, including the signature selection leaves on the genome.

## Join the lab!
I am looking for a graduate student! 

If you are interested, please get in contact with me! I encourage interested applicants to contact me with the following information: (1) CV; (2) Summary of research experience; and (3) Statement of research interests and potential project topics. 

For more information on pursuing a postgraduate degree at the University of Canterbury, please take a look at the [handbook](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/biological-sciences/postgraduate-study/). 

### Diversity and Equity

My lab is inclusive, welcoming, and committed to advancing diversity; I welcome everyone regardless of their ethnicity, color, socioeconomic background, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, and age. I especially encourage members of historically underrepresented groups including (but not limited to) people of color, women, veterans, and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities to inquire about opportunities and apply to join my group.
