I am currently pursuing my PhD at RADICAL Lab with Professor Shantenu Jha as my advisor. Prior to joining Rutgers, I was an undergraduate student in Greece at National Technical University of Athens.

My main interests are Distributed Systems, High Performance Computing and Data Science. In my free time I like playing soccer and traveling. For more information about me visit my LinkedIn page.
