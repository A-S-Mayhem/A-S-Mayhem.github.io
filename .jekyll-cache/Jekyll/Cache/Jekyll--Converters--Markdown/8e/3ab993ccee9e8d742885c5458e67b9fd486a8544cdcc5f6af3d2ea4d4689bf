I"ú<p>I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh researching representation learning for deep reinforcement learning. 
I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/">Professor Amos Storkey</a> 
and a member of the <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/">Bayesian and Neural Systems</a> group.</p>

<p>Prior to my PhD research, I completed my bachelorâ€™s in economics at the University of North Texas 
and my masterâ€™s in artificial intelligence at Northwestern University. Additionally, I was a visiting researcher
at the <a href="https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Autonomous Agents Research Group</a> under the advisement of 
<a href="https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/">Professor Stefano Albrecht</a>.</p>
