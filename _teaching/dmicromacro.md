Tutorials & Lectures

I provided tutorials in *Microeconomics* (2018) and *Introduction to Economics & Business* (2017-2018) courses. In *Topics in International Economy & Policy* (2017-2022), I introduced students to the topic of monetary policy & financial stability by means of lecturing, tutoring, and supervising a policy paper.
