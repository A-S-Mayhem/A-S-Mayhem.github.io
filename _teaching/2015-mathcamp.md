Math Camp to review important mathematical material for incoming PhD students in Economics at UCSB. In 2015, I co-taught this class with Patrick Holder. I covered linear algebra, statistics, and coding, while Patrick covered calculus and analysis.

Our joint syllabus is [here](https://cseveren.github.io/files/MathCamp15_Syllabus.pdf).
