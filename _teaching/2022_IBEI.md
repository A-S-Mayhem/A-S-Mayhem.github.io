This course aimes at identifying how to iteratively implement quantitative and qualitative analysis with an emphasis on the key factors and causal mechanisms at work. It focuses on (1) ongoing methodological debates to analyse multiple ways of integrating quantitative and qualitative research; and (2) on practical implementation of mixed-methods research in ongoing and/or future projects. The course is helpful for students who consider pursuing a PhD and/or publishing their MA theses in academic journals using mixed-methods techniques.
