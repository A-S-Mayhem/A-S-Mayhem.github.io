# Course Rationale and Overview
In the System Dynamics course, students will learn how to model and analyse the dynamics of large-scale economic, social or technological systems and processes. System dynamics is grounded in the modern theory of nonlinear dynamics and control theory. Students will learn how to describe the structures of complex systems and build simulations of real-world problems. Students will discover the basic concepts of system dynamics: stocks and flows, feedback loops, control strategies, state oscillation and instability, S-shaped growth, overshoot and collapse, path dependency and other nonlinear dynamics. In the course, students will explore different problem domains, build up their skills by practising on small assignments, and finally demonstrate their knowledge and skills in a project, using a system dynamics modelling environment.
