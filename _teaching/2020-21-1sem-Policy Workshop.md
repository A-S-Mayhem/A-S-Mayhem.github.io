Graduate policy workshops are a unique part of the Woodrow Wilson School graduate curriculum.
Policy workshops provide students with an opportunity to use the analytical skills they have acquired in the first year in the program to analyze complex and challenging policy issues, usually for real clients.
The workshops emphasize policy implementation, and it is this emphasis that distinguishes them from regular courses. The goal of the workshops is to understand a policy issue in great depth and to make policy recommendations that are both creative and realistic, given the relevant institutional and political constraints. 
Each workshop consists of eight to 10 students who work in teams to evaluate a policy challenge. Most students engage in field research during the fall break period.
Each workshop produces a final report and gives a final presentation to the client, typically sometime between mid-December and late January.
