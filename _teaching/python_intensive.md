The course addresses the essential elements to develop intermediate Python programming skills. In particular, the objective is to present tools for the visualization and extraction of data. Students will learn tools such as defining functions, manipulating and cleaning data from regular expressions. These intermediate tools will be necessary to work with specialized data visualization and extraction libraries such as Matplotlib, Folium and Selenium.
