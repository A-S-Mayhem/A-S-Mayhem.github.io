**Descrtiption from Course Catalog**
This course discusses the theory and application of linear algebra and differential equations. Emphasis is placed on building intuition for the underlying concepts and their applications in engineering practice along with tools for solving problems. We will also use computer simulations in MATLAB to augment this intuition.
