The [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/education/) offers hands-on training in AI and accelerated computing to solve real-world problems. Through self-paced online and instructor-led training powered by GPUs in the cloud, developers, data scientists, researchers, and students can get practical experience and earn a certificate of competency to support professional growth.

As an NVIDIA UniversityAmbassador I have the ability to bring free, world-class Deep Learning training to your academic community using proven DLI cloud-based training platform and lecture materials. If you are interested in organazing free instructor-lead workshops for your university staff, resarchers and students, let me know!

Currently I am a DLI certified instructor for two courses:

Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Computer Vision
======
This is an introductory 1-day workshop aimed at people who have heard of Deep Learning and would like to get their feet wet. I love the material, it is very intuitive and does not require any advanced computer skills.

Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Multiple Data Types
======
Despite being a fundamentals workshop, this 1-day workshop is aimed at people with some Python programming ability and basic Deep Learning knowledge. In it we combine Deep Learning approaches to image segmentation and Natural Language Processing to generate captions from images and video.
