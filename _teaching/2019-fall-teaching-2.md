Deep learning is an area within machine learning that deals with algorithms and models that automatically induce multi-level data representations.

In recent years, deep learning and deep networks have significantly improved the state-of-the-art in many application domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This class will cover the fundamentals of deep learning and provide a rich set of hands-on tasks and practical projects to familiarize students with this emerging technology.

Responsible for giving tutorials covering part of the topics taught in lecture, making exam questions, project grading.
