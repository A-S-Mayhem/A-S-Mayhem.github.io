title: "2. Air-sea fluxes parameterization"
collection: Research
---
In FIO-AOW,  the atmospheric component (WRF), ocean surface wave component (MASNUM), and ocean circulation
component (POM & ROMS) are physically coupled together by introducing these processes:
1. Thermal effect of sea spray on air-sea heat and moisture fluxes
2. Sea state dependent air-sea momentum flux
3. Non-breaking wave-induced vertical mixing
4. Relative wind speed
5. Rain-induced surface cooling
