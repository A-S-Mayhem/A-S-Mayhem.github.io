## Spring 2022 


### ECE4872/4873 Senior Design
 - Tired Techies 
    - Project: The team of computer, electrical, and mechanical engineers created a sleep-monitoring mask and smart alarm that reduces drowsiness by waking the sleeper during the correct sleep cycle. The device measures eye movement throughout the night and processes the data to classify sleep stages.

 - The Neast Team
    - Project: We designed a locker and a phone application that enables Papa John's customers to directly access their order in a fast and efficient manner. This locker has a scanner, which the customers will use to scan a unique barcode that they will retrieve once they are done ordering through the application. Once this code is scanned, the locker is opened, and the customer can retrieve their pizza. The order will contain information such as approximately what time their pizza will be ready and notify the customer when your pizza is hot and ready to be picked up in the locker.
