Course Description
======

Most of us think that we know our own minds as well as, or better than, we know anything else. But it is very hard to see how minds fit in with the rest of nature. Why would the firing of neurons give rise to something so remarkable as conscious experience? And if the mind is entirely physical, must it be governed by the laws of physics? If so, is free will just an illusion? On the other hand, if the mind is not physical, how does it manage to causally interact with the physical world? These are some of the fundamental questions in the philosophy of mind. This course is an introduction to the debates surrounding them. We will examine closely the works of four philosophers from the Early Modern period, namely Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650), Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), John Locke (1632-1704), and David Hume (1711-1776), focusing on their views about the nature of the mind and its relationship with the body, about whether there is such a thing as innate knowledge, about personal identity, freedom, and non-human minds.
