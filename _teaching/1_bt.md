Since 2017, I have been supervising Bachelor's theses on a variety of topics in experimental finance, including, among others: risk perception, belief formation, myopic loss aversion, time preferences.

Since 2022, I have been co-coordinating this course, involving the setup and organization, lectures, provision of support sessions and facilities, and the assessment structure and organization.
