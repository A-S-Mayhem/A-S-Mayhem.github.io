**Course Description**

What is “monster?” These horrifying but fascinating creatures have roamed around us, touching our fears and desires. Under the banner of normalcy, these monstrous beings are always symbolic of “others” who are excluded and denied from “our” society throughout history. From Morgan le Fay, the power-desiring witch in Arthurian romances to mentally disordered *Joker* in Todd Phillips film, they have been differentiated based on religion, race, class, and gender. However, these symbolic “others” often challenge the dominant forces of ostracizing, erasing, and repressing them by posing a question about who the monster actually is. In this section of WRS 106, students will read and analyze “monsters” from Medieval romances to contemporary literary and film texts and examine how they have been created, developed, and reiterated in those texts. Throughout the journey of exploring and writing about “monsters,” students will become more sophisticated readers and writers by focusing on textual analysis. Students will conduct close reading exercises, analyze primary and secondary texts, and explore how to apply texts to theoretical frameworks and how they engage in conversation with each other. Moreover, students will conduct academic research, learn how to build well-supported arguments, and continue to improve their writing through various writing-related activities.
