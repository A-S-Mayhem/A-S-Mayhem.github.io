## Introduction

This is the Task #9 of SemEval 2019. 

Suggestion mining can be defined as the extraction of suggestions from unstructured text, where the term ’suggestions’ refers to the expressions of tips, advice, recommendations etc. Consumer opinions towards commercial entities like brands, services, and products are generally expressed through online reviews, blogs, discussion forums, or social media platforms. These opinions largely express positive and negative sentiments towards a given entity, but also tend to contain suggestions for improvising the entity or tips to the fellow consumers.

In this project, the organisers introduce suggestion mining as a simple task of classifying given sentences into suggestion and non-suggestion classes. With this task, they will evaluate the submitted systems for two domains, software developers suggestion forum, and hotel reviews. They will evaluate the cross domain performance of statistical models, since suggestions tend to possess similar linguistic properties across domains. It can also prove to be an evaluation for transfer learning methods.
