This course is the second in the Ph.D. statistics sequence at the Department of Communication, MSU. It has a prerequisite of COM 901 or its equivalent. It is a four-credit class. The course aims to provide PhD students with a working knowledge of the assumptions, concepts, and theories underlying the most frequently used multivariate analysis techniques in quantitative social and behavioral sciences. These techniques include, but are not limited to, multiple regression, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis, structural equation modelling (SEM), multilevel analysis, and time series analysis. The selection of specific topics may be tailored to studentsâ€™ research needs. The focus will be on practical issues such as selecting the appropriate analysis, preparing data for analysis in the popular statistical tools (e.g., SPSS, AMOS, or R), interpreting output, and presenting results of a complex nature. This course is a mixture of lectures, discussions, and hands-on practices.
