The english translation of the title is "$\LaTeX$ for dummies: a survival guide for physicists".

This course, **held in italian**, is part of the activities organized by the Padua Local Committee of the Italian Association of Physics Students and it is aimed at undergraduate students who still haven't learned how to use $\LaTeX$, or know just the very basics. The aim of the course is to lay the foundations of a basic knowledge of $\LaTeX$: at the end of the course attendees will **not** be experts of $\LaTeX$ but will know how to write basic documents like lab reports, theses and presentations, and will have the knowledge and instruments to learn independently new and more elaborate aspects of the language.

## Program of the course
The course is divided into four lessons, which cover the following topics:
- Lesson 1: The basics - [slides of the lecture](/files/slides/corso_LaTeX_2018-12/LaTeX_1_basics.pdf){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->
- Lesson 2: Mathematics - [slides of the lecture](/files/slides/corso_LaTeX_2018-12/LaTeX_2_mathematics.pdf){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->
- Lesson 3: The `article`, `report` and `book` classes - [slides of the lecture](/files/slides/corso_LaTeX_2018-12/LaTeX_3_article-report-book.pdf){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->
- Lesson 4: The `beamer` class - [slides of the lecture](/files/slides/corso_LaTeX_2018-12/LaTeX_4_beamer.pdf){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->

The main reference of the course, on which most of the content of the lectures is based, is the seminal [L'arte di scrivere con $\LaTeX$](http://www.lorenzopantieri.net/LaTeX.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> ("The art of writing with $\LaTeX$"), by Lorenzo Pantieri.

## Schedule and venue
The lessons will be held on:
- 6/12/2018, **in room LUF1** (Via Luzzatti venue) **from 16:30**
- 10/12/2018, **in room LUF2** (Via Luzzatti venue) **from 16:30**
- 12/12/2018, **in room LUF2 from 14:30**
- 13/12/2018, **in room LUF1 from 16:30**

Attendees are strongly encouraged to bring their own laptop (power outlets are available in the room), and to install any $\LaTeX$ editor and compiler on it in order to practice during the lessons and at home (see the second chapter of "L'arte di scrivere con $\LaTeX$" for details on how to install $\LaTeX$ on any operating system). In alternative, [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> can be used, but in that case an internet connection is necessary and so everyone who intends to use Overleaf **must** configure his/her laptop in order to connect to the University's [eduroam](https://www.unipd.it/eduroam){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> network.
