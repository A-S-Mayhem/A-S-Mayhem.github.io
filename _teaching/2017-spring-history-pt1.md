Course Description
======

Some of what we learn in life comes through first-hand experience, as in the cases of knowing the taste of chocolate or how to ride a bicycle. But very often we learn from other people, be it what our parents and friends tell us, what we read in the news, or what we are taught by institutions like schools, religious organizations, and the scientific community. Some of what we think about the world seems to be beyond question (for example, 2+2=4), whereas other facts are subject to revision (for example, the number of planets in the solar system, or if coffee is good for your health). But what is the difference between the many sources and kinds of knowledge we have? Should we even think of all of them as “knowledge” or is that a special label that only a few of our thoughts deserve? In the face of uncertainty and conflicting information, how do we know who to trust and what to believe? And can this kind of conflict exist within the same person, for example between reason and passion, between the senses and the intellect, between body and mind? Throughout history, women and men have asked similar questions, attempting to determine what knowledge is and how (if at all) we can obtain it. This course is an introduction to some of their answers. By examining profound and enduring philosophical works spanning a period of almost two thousand years, from Ancient Greece up to the Middle Ages, students will gain a greater understanding of contemporary philosophical issues and will become better equipped to respond as critical epistemic agents.
