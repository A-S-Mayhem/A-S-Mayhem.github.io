During the Fall 2022 semester, I TA'd 12.410/8.287 at MIT, the undergraduate course on observational techniques of optical astronomy. The course involved students learning about the basics of observational astronomy and designing, executing, and writing-up their own observational astronomy project. As the TA, I took students to Wallace Astrophysical Observatory (WAO) in Westford, MA for weekly observing with the 14in and 24in telescopes, and I also assisted with project design, data analysis, and write-up.
