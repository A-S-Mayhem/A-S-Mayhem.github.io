My Faculty of Technical Sciences teachers' portal shows that I've supervised 9 Bechelor and 9 Master Theses since we transitioned to the 
Bologna process. In addition to that, there has been a few "old" students that I have supervised over the years. All in all, I seem to have 
been a member of 51 thesis defence committees over the years. While I always consider it a priviledge when students select me to supervise their thesis
work, as well as when colleagues invite me to take part in the committee, of particular note are the PhD students that I've mentored over the years.
These are listed below.
