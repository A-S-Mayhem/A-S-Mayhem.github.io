This course provides a bridge between causal inference in economic analysis and machine learning (ML) methods. It exposes classic structural econometric models and their modern version of Artificial Intelligence (AI), known as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). It provides statistical inference tools based on ML and AI (lasso, random forest and deep neural networks), to infer causal parameters and quantify uncertainty. The course will be taught from a practical and applied perspective, using programming languages such as R and Python. In parallel we will learn the version control system in Git and GitHub.
