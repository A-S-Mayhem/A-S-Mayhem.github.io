I designed and taught a lesson on using git and GitHub for collaborative reproducible workflows for the Statistics Graduate Student Association. [The presentation materials are here](https://github.com/kellieotto/git-fundamentals).

Credit goes to the D-Lab for creating many of the materials; I forked the repository, customized them, and created some of my own lessons for the talk.
