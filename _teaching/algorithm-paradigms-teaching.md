Course Description
======

The lecture deepens and supplements the knowledge from the lecture on data structures.
Specifically, we look at different algorithm paradigms, i.e. schemes for designing efficient algorithms. 
For this purpose, we first look at the already known paradigms incremental, divide-and-conquer, and greedy and apply them to different problems.
Building on this, we learn about dynamic programming, as well as the methods backtracking and branch-and-bound.
We also look at a paradigm specifically for geometric problems: the sweepline method
