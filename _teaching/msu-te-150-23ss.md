The shooting on February 13th devastated everyone, including me and my students. Myself and some other TE 150 
instructors decided to facilitate an optional class the week after the shooting where we discussed how we are 
processing it. This class was informed by a seminar held by [Professor Alyssa Hadley Dunn](https://education.uconn.edu/person/alyssa-hadley-dunn/)
who is an MSU alumn at UConn who studies trauma in educational settings.

I also designed a [lesson connecting Wikipedia](/files/slides/te-150-wikipedia.pdf) to the course content by conceptualizing Wikipedia as a social constructivist tool.
Students engaged in Wikipedia editing during class and reflected on how editor bias affects the world.
