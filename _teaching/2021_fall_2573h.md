### Homework ### 
Assigned problems are due at the beginning of recitation on Tuesdays. The homework assignments are listed on this page. The lowest two homework scores will be dropped from your final grade.
Homework is your exercise for this course. There will be a lot of it, and it should be taken seriously.

- Midterm I is on Friday, October 5

The final exam is on Friday, December 14 from 1:30pm to 4:30pm (location to be annouced toward the end of the semester).Exam policiesNo notes or books are permitted.

| Category	| Grade basis	| Points each	| Total |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------  | -----  |
| Homework |	Best | 10 | 	10	| 100 |
| Midterms	| All exams	| 200 |	600 |
| Final exam	|  | 	300	| 300 |
| Total |  | 	 	| 1000 | 

We do not have fixed gradelines for this class. Typically, the distribution of the final grades is approximately 20% A, 25% B, 40% C and 15% D and F.

### Make-ups ###
Students must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time or will miss an exam. Exam absences due to recognized University related activities, religious holidays, verifiable illness, and family/medical emergencies will be dealt with on an individual basis. See official University Policy on Makeup Examinations for Legitimate Absences.

### Attendance ### 
The class will be conducted under the presumption that you have attended all lectures and recitation sessions. In particular, you are responsible for all the announcements made in class.

### Scholastic conduct ###
We expect the highest standards of conduct from members of this class. Academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated. See the Student Conduct Code.

### Incompletes ###
A final grade of incomplete is given only if you have successfully completed all but a small portion of the work of the course, and have a very compelling, well documented reason for not completing the course. You cannot receive an incomplete simply because you are behind in your work; in this case you should drop the course.

### Drop dates ###
You may drop the course without permission by the start of the fifth week of the semester. If you drop before the start of the third week, no mention of the course will appear on your transcripts. Otherwise, you receive a "W" for the course. However, it will cost you more money to drop the course later in the semester.
