### Make-ups ### 
Students must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time or will miss an exam. Exam absences due to recognized University related activities, religious holidays, verifiable illness, and family/medical emergencies will be dealt with on an individual basis. See official University Policy on Makeup Examinations for Legitimate Absences.
### Attendance ### The class will be conducted under the presumption that you have attended all lectures and recitation sessions. In particular, you are responsible for all the announcements made in class.Scholastic conductWe expect the highest standards of conduct from members of this class. Academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated. See the Student Conduct Code.Student privacy and course websiteStudent grades will be posted through the course's Moodle site; this site also hosts a forum where students may discuss material related to the course. In this class, our use of technology will sometimes make students' names and Internet IDs visible within the course website, but only to other students in the same class. Since we are using a secure, password-protected course website, this will not increase the risk of identity theft or spamming for anyone in the class. If you have concerns about the visibility of your Internet ID, please contact your lecturer for further information.IncompletesA final grade of incomplete is given only if you have successfully completed all but a small portion of the work of the course, and have a very compelling, well documented reason for not completing the course. You cannot receive an incomplete simply because you are behind in your work; in this case you should drop the course.Drop datesYou may drop the course without permission by the start of the fifth week of the semester. If you drop before the start of the third week, no mention of the course will appear on your transcripts. Otherwise, you receive a "W" for the course. However, it will cost you more money to drop the course later in the semester.University policiesStatements on many other aspects of University policy can be found through this page.
