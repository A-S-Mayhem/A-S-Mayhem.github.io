Overview
======
This course focuses on topics on convex optimisation, deep learning and differentiable optimisation

Learning Outcomes:
1. Distinguish definitions of key concepts in convex analysis, including convexity of sets and functions, subgradients, and the convex dual.
2. Derive basic results about convex functions such as Jensenâ€™s inequality.
3. Deduce how Bregman divergences are constructed from convex functions and derive some of their properties.
4. Produce a formal optimization problem from a high-level description and determine whether the problem is convex.
5. Recognize standard convex optimization problems such as linear programs and quadratic programs.
6. Derive the standard (dual) quadratic program for support vector machines and understand the extension to max-margin methods for structured prediction.
7. Implement and analyse gradient descent algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent and mirror descent.
