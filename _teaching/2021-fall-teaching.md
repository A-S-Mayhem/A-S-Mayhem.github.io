Worked under Prof. [Rahul Chatterjee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chatterjee/) as a teching assistant for his class Introduction to Information Security.
I assisted in both creating and grading assignments and exams. I proctored in-person and online exams. I frequently interacted with students during regular in-person office hours as well as online using the Piazza classroom messaging board.
