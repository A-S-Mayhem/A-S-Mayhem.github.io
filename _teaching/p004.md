As a Teaching Assistant for the Introduction to Cognitive Science and Neuroscience course, my role was focused on facilitating the learning process for students. Specifically, I was responsible for organizing and administering one of the course's homework assignments, as well as meticulously grading the submissions. This task allowed me to engage with students, assess their understanding of the subject matter, and provide valuable feedback to aid in their academic growth. Through this experience, I not only strengthened my grasp of cognitive science and neuroscience concepts but also honed my ability to support and mentor students in their educational journey. It was a rewarding opportunity to contribute to their learning experience and foster a deeper appreciation for the field.
