Over the last 2 decades, I've taught and created numerous courses at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, as I progressed from a TA to Full Professor. These days most of my materials have migrated to our [e-Learning platform](http://ellab.ftn.uns.ac.rs/), so this page is reduced to a non-exhaustive list of the stuff I've taught. Not sure of what use it is to anybody, but just in case. If not explicitly stated otherwise, the courses were taught at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad.
