  - Final Exam: 2
  - For instance, if Midterm Exam 1 is missed, the score will be calculated as follows: 
    - Max_possible_midterm_exam_1_score * (1 * your_midterm_exam_2_score/max_possible_midterm_exam_2_score + 2 * your_final_exam_score/max_possible_final_exam_score)/(1+2)

## Grading Policy
- Homework: 40%
- Each Midterm: 15%
- Final Exam: 30%

## Calculator Policy
