Course Description
======

Is climate change a moral emergency? Should we seek out consumer products that are "natural" and "green," and foods that are "GMO-free" and "humanely-raised"? Do non-human animals, plants, and ecosystems have moral interests? Are individuals and corporations obligated to reduce their environmental impact, even if others are not making an eort? How do social and political factors like poverty, gender, race, and inequality relate to environmental issues? These questions and others are explored in this introductory course on the ethical and philosophical issues raised by environmental problems. No prior background in philosophy is necessary.
