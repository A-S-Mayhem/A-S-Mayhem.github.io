Course Description
======

Is climate change a moral emergency? Should we seek out consumer products that are "natural" and "green," and foods that are "GMO-free" and "humanely-raised"? Do non-human animals, plants, and ecosystems have moral interests? Are individuals and/or corporations obligated to reduce their environmental impact, even if others are not making an effort? How do social and political issues like poverty, and gender and race inequality relate to environmental issues? And finally how do these social and political dimensions of the environmental crisis relate to questions about personal identity, the meaning of life and the meaning of work? These questions and others are explored in this introductory course on the metaphysical, ethical, political and existencial issues raised by environmental problems. No prior background in philosophy is necessary.
