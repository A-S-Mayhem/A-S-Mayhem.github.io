In this project we describe a way to determine the optimal tree structured cascade configuration.

## Cascading Architecture

Consider a binary classification problem in which the datalabels are imbalanced ( # 0's >> #1's). Often, in these sort of problems classifying a datapoint with its correct label '1' is much harder task than classifying a datapoint correctly with label '0'. So, computationally we want to design a model which puts little effort is labelling datapoint as '0' and more effort effort in labelling datapoint as '1'. Cascading Architeture, first discussed in [1] addresses this.

In this architeture we have a bunch of classifiers $ n $ with increasing capacity ( 1< 2 < .. < n). $P_{i}(x)$ is the probability that datapoint $x$ is '1' by $i^{th}$ classifier. The datapoint is passed throught all classifiers which are ordered accoring to their capacity. If a classifier labels the point as '0' with probability > 0.5, Cascading model is gonna classify it as 0. A point is gonna labelled as '1' only when all the $ n $ classifiers output with probability > 0.5.
