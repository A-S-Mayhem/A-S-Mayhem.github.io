If you need to see me, **do not email me** but instead make directly an appointment [here](https://calendly.com/bahamonde/officehours). 

* There is *no* need for confirmation. I will receive an alert when you schedule a meeting with me. 
* Briefly indicate the reason for the meeting. 

* *All kinds of questions/concerns are welcomed*. 
* **I am looking forward to meeting you!**
