Each semester in this course I guided approximately 75 students through 7 laboratory exercises to broaden their understanding of the field of Astronomy. Labs included explorations of the StarryNight software to understand astronomy across the globe, building telescopes out of a series of lenses, calculating the orbital speeds of planets, and more. 

During this course I always encourages students to ask question about anything astronomy-related, especially if it was outside of what was being taught in class. I would compile the questions and answers into a document to distribute at the end of each semester.
