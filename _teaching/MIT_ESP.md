During the spring and summer of 2021, I was a volunteer teacher for two events through the MIT Educational Studies Program. In one of these events, I taught 30 middle school students about supermassive black holes and active galaxies during a single hour-long class. The other event consisted of three hour-long classes focused on various topics in black hole astrophysics, aimed at late high school students and co-taught with another MIT astrophysics PhD student.
