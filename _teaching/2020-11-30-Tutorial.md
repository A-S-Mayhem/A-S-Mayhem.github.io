Tutorial of the online [Winter School on Quantitative Systems Biology](https://indico.ictp.it/event/9131/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> organized by ICTP.

This tutorial is part of the lectures given during the [Winter School on Quantitative Systems Biology](https://indico.ictp.it/event/9131/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, held online and organized by ICTP. It is divided in two lectures, and its aim is to introduce basic concepts on nonlinear dynamics, and in particular on how to study the stability of equilibria in nonlinear systems.

The videos of both the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX04MjVFD_c){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW66AEvtq48){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> lectures are available on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3cvRkdfO-76JKosmx1tiXw){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> of the Quantitative Life Sciences section of ICTP.

The slides I have shown during the lectures can be found [here](/files/slides/2020-11-30-tutorial-ICTP.pdf){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.
