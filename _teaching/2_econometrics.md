In the *Statistics* course, I provide case lectures helping students get familiar with simple statistical tests.
In subsequent *Econometrics & Integration* courses, we connect econometric theory with financial applications in computer lab sessions (using R), assignment sessions, and paper writing. I supervise both the project papers, and design and provide the lab and assignment sessions.

I helped the department to switch to the use of the R statistical software package. Together with two other colleagues, I designed and held an introductory and advanced R course for department staff members.
