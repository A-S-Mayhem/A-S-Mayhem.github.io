In Fall 2022, I served as a TF for BST 222 taught by Rui Duan. I taught labs for this course in probability theory and statistical inference for masters students in biostatistics and doctoral students in epidemiology, environmental sciences, and other departments, using Casella and Berger. I also TF'ed for this course in 2021, 2020, and 2019.
