I served as a TF in Fall 2022 for BST 222 taught by Rui Duan. I also TF'ed for this course in 2021, 2020, and 2019. I taught labs for this course in probability theory and statistical inference for masters students in biostatistics and doctoral students in epidemiology, environmental sciences, and other departments, using Casella and Berger.
