In Summer 2022, I worked as a teaching associate (instructor) for the course GEOG 176A: Introduction to Geographic Information Systems and Science. This is a upper-diviison course, aiming to provide comprehensive overview of Geographic Information Systems and Science. Topics span the nature of geographic information and the procedures for operating GIS. Labs provide hands-on experience with GIS and related software.
