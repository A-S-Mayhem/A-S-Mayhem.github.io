As part of MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP, or essentially a January term), I was the TA for 12.411, an undergraduate astronomy field camp that took place at Teide Observatory on the island of Tenerife. I assisted students with 8 nights of observing on 4 different telescopes (0.6-1.5m) at the observatory, as well as with data analysis, interpretation, and final report writing. The students' presented their work at the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias and their hard work was highlighted in this [article](https://www.iac.es/en/outreach/news/first-mit-astronomy-field-camp-teide-observatory).
