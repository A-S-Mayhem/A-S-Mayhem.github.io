I served as the head teaching fellow in Spring 2021 for this doctoral course for biostatistics students on advanced topics in the design, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials, including study design; choice of endpoints; interim analyses and group sequential methods; subgroup analyses; and meta-analyses. I served as a teaching fellow in Spring 2020.
