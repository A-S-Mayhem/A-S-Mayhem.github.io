Tutorials, Lectures & Coordination

I am the coordinator and lecturer of *Academic Skills: Mathematics*, an entry-level math course students take at the beginning of their study program. In *Mathematics in Economics & Business*, a more advanced Bachelor course, I provide tutorials and a part of the lectures. In 2022, I coordinated this course as well.
