Worked as TA for the CS 370 undergraduate level course on Numerical Approximation in University of Waterloo. Addressed students' doubts by taking office hours for all four assignments. Created Video solutions for one of the assignments. Delved concepts such as systems of ODEs, Euler approximation, Runge-Kutta approximation and Discerete Fourier Transforms (DFTs). All codes were written in Python.
