In my role as the Head Teaching Assistant for the Introduction to Statistical Inference course, I took on a multifaceted role that encompassed both leadership and academic responsibilities. My primary duty involved orchestrating and managing a team of teaching assistants, ensuring the seamless coordination of various aspects of the course. This included overseeing the review and grading of homework assignments to maintain consistency and quality. Additionally, I was responsible for creating informative and engaging lecture slides, enriching the learning experience for students. Another significant responsibility was the selection of the subject for the final project, a task that allowed me to align course objectives with practical and challenging projects. Through this experience, I not only deepened my understanding of statistical inference but also developed invaluable leadership and organizational skills, ultimately contributing to the overall success of the course.
