## Introduction

This is the project, which I did during my research internship in FudanNLP group. I was supervised by Prof. Xipeng Qiu.

I worked on the multi-task learning framework to jointly learn across multiple related tasks. And I participated in developing three mechanisms of sharing information to model text with task-specific and shared layers based on recurrent neural network.
