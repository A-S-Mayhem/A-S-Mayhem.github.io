I taught a guest lecture on [concurrency with `fork()`](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/20wi/lectures/25/CSE%20333%20Concurrency%20&%20Processes-ink.pdf) in addition to TA'ing. I also designed a research-based [debugging component on their homework](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/20wi/hw/hw1.php#journal) to encourage metacognition. This intervention has since been used in future iterations of the course.
