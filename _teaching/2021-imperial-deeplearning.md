In this role I assist the lecturer in coordinating the TAs, create tutorials for the students, mark coursework and help students in tutorials. For this module I, in colaboration with [Alex Spies](https://afspies.com) developed the Generative Models coursework which challenged the students to create and evaluate a Variational AutoEncoder and a Generative Adversarial Network.
