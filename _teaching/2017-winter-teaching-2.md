We are living in a world surrounded by social movements. If you are a DACA supporter, you might attend protests against Trumpâ€™s DACA Repeal; if you care about freedom and justice, you might participate in or hashtag Black Lives Matter Movement; you might also sign some online petitions on the websites such as change.org and moveon.org; you might also twitter some protests or issues initiated by some social movement organizations. But You may also wonder that do all these efforts we have made matter?

The goal of this course is to introduce basic theoretical frameworks of social movements to address the following questions and lead students to use these sociological lens to understand contemporary social movements activism in American society, such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter.

 What is a social movement? Why do some people participate in them, while others do not? How do sociologists think about social movements? Why some movements succeed and others fail? How do new technologies such as the Internet and social media influence social movements? And Finally, do social movements work? These are the questions that we try to address in this class.
