As the Head Teaching Assistant for Engineering Probability and Statistics, I had the privilege of leading a dedicated team of teaching assistants for a period spanning six semesters. In this role, I not only managed and mentored fellow teaching assistants but also played a pivotal role in shaping the course content for each semester. This involved meticulous planning and coordination to ensure that the curriculum aligned with the learning objectives and the needs of our students. Additionally, I was responsible for designing and administering quizzes, as well as overseeing the development of final projects for each semester. This multifaceted experience not only deepened my understanding of probability and statistics but also enhanced my leadership and organizational skills, ultimately contributing to a more enriching educational experience for both students and faculty alike.
