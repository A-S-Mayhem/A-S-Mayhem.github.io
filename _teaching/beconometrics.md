Tutorials, Lectures & Coordination

In the *Statistics* course, I provide case lectures helping students connect statistical theory with applications. In subsequent *Econometrics & Integration* courses, we embed econometric theory in financial applications in computer lab sessions (using R), assignment sessions, and paper writing. I design and provide the lab and assignment sessions. Moreover, I helped the department switch to the use of R in teaching: Together with two other colleagues, I designed and held an introductory and advanced R course for department staff members.
