# Description
 The 2015 Paris Accord signaled a global consensus that climate change is a major threat to ecosystems, livelihoods and the economy and that energy systems must change. Not well comprehended are the scale and pace of the needed transformation. Bottlenecks and constraints are inevitable with rapid, large-scale change. These must be anticipated and addressed to achieve climate goals -- this is the essence of Rapid Switch analysis. Prospective regional and sectoral energy transitions are analyzed through multi-disciplinary lenses to identify bottlenecks and potential solutions and policies to maximize the pace of transition.

# Reading/Writing Assignments
 Readings and five homework assignments through week 9 will build and test knowledge and application of concepts drawn from multiple disciplines. Assignments will be completed in small multi-disciplinary teams and provide a foundation for team projects assessing specific energy transitions. The midterm will comprise oral and written presentation of progress and plans for the energy-transition case study. The final will comprise written and oral presentation of the case study.

# Requirements/Grading
Paper in lieu of mid term - 10% 
Paper in lieu of final - 40% 
Oral presentation(s) - 15% 
Class/precept participation - 10% 
Problem set(s) - 25% 

# Prerequisites and Restrictions
This course is open to any undergraduate student. Enrollment by students from a mix of disciplines will enrich the course experience for all.

# Other Information
Starting in week 9, multi-disciplinary student teams will use class time (and outside time) to further develop energy-transition case study analyses, building on prior homework assignments and guided by instructors with backgrounds in social sciences, engineering, systems sciences, and business practice. The case studies will assess vulnerability of a transition to bottlenecks, prioritize the bottlenecks, and develop strategies to relieve bottlenecks so as to accelerate the transition.
