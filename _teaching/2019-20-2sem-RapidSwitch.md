Spring 2020

The 2015 Paris Accord signaled a global consensus that climate change is a major threat to ecosystems, livelihoods, and the economy and that energy systems must change. Not well comprehended are the scale and pace of the needed transformation. Bottlenecks and constraints are inevitable with rapid, large-scale change. These must be anticipated and addressed to achieve climate goals -- this is the essence of Rapid Switch analysis. Prospective regional and sectoral energy transitions are analyzed through multi-disciplinary lenses to identify bottlenecks and potential solutions and policies to maximize the pace of transition.

The course is in preparation for a substantial overhaul of the syllabus to take advantage of new various expertise and interests in the department, as well as to make changes motivated by lessons learned last spring.
