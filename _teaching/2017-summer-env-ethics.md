Course Description
======

Many people will grant that the way humans affect the environment _matters_. But people tend to disagree about _why_ it matters. Should we care about environmental
degradation only when it could have a negative impact on human life? Or is the environment intrinsically worthy of moral consideration, independently of any potential
consequences to humans? Many people intuitively think that it is morally wrong to destroy nature when destruction is avoidable, and moreover that, as a society, we should take steps to conserve natural resources and to protect endangered natural habitats as well as endangered plant and animal species—that is, _we should save nature_. But what do we mean by “nature”? It seems that we mean too many things: we apply the term “natural” to things that are not artificial and/or not affected by humankind (as in the notion of “pristine” wilderness); but we also apply the label “natural” to human-made consumer goods (such as some food and clothing items) as well as to engineered structures (such as buildings) when they are “green” or “sustainable”. The ambiguity of these terms raises a series of questions. For one, if we have a responsibility to protect the environment, does it matter if the environment is natural or not? Moreover, does it still make sense to talk about protecting what is natural when it is no longer clear what is natural and what is not? This course is a survey of environmental ethics with a focus on these questions. By examining classical as well as recent theories, students will gain a greater understanding of the relation between philosophical, scientific and economic perspectives, and will become better equipped to respond to pressing environmental challenges as responsible agents.
