# under construction!!! #
# Math 8301: Manifold and Topology #


### Time ### 
3:35pm - 4:25 pm MWF 
### Location ###
tbd

### Office ### 
Vincent Hall 365
### Office hours ### 
TBD

### Textbooks ### 
I will follow the following textbook very loosely. Occasionally I will skip some proofs in lecture, and you can read the textbook for the proofs.
- [Introduction to Topological Manifolds (Graduate Texts in Mathematics, 202) 2nd ed. 2011 Edition by John Lee](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-7940-7)

Extra reading materials
- [Algebraic topology by Allen Hatcher.](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf)


### Contents ###
Classification of compact surfaces, fundamental group/covering spaces. Homology group, basic cohomology. Application to degree of a map, invariance of domain/dimension.

A detailed day by day plan can be found on [Canvas](here).

### Prerequisites ### 
Some point-set topology and abstract algebra. In particular, you should be comfortable with connectedness, compactness, Hausdorfness, (co)kernels of linear maps, as well as groups, rings and linear algebra.

### Homework ### 
Homework will be assigned on weekly on [Canvas](https://erkaobao.github.io/math/teaching/2022_fall_8301).
There will be 11 or 12 assignments depending on the course progress.

### Office hours ###
TBA
