In my role as the Head Teaching Assistant for a Machine Learning course, I had the privilege of spearheading a team of teaching assistants while actively shaping the entire semester's curriculum. As the manager of fellow teaching assistants, I provided guidance, support, and mentorship to ensure the smooth delivery of the course. Moreover, I played a crucial role in collaborating with instructors to develop the course content, which included selecting topics, deciding on teaching methodologies, and crafting assignments. One of the key responsibilities was coordinating with instructors to determine the subject and scope of the final projects, ensuring that they were both challenging and aligned with the course objectives. This experience not only deepened my expertise in machine learning but also honed my leadership and organizational skills, contributing to an enriching learning experience for students and facilitating the successful execution of the course.
