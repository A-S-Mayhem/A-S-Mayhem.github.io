## Course Description
Graduate-level linear algebra course aimed for the application in data science, where the undergraduatelevel linear algebra, calculus, and statistics are prerequisites. The course is going to be mostly “theory” to help the students understand the essentials of linear algebra principles, geometric interpretations, and numerical algorithms. The primary objective of the class is to prepare students with engineering background a solid mathematical foundation for studying or working on subjects such as system informatics, machine learning and intelligent robotics.  

## Student Learning Outcomes

- Understand linear algebra principles, algorithms.
- Compute using software tools and interpret the results.
