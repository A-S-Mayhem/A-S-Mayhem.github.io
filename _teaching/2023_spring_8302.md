# Math 8301: Manifold and Topology #


### Time ### 
3:35pm - 4:25 pm MWF 
### Location ###
Vincent Hall 20


### Office ### 
Vincent Hall 365
### Zoom Meeting ID ###
[973 584 3950](https://umn.zoom.us/j/9735843950)

### Contents ###
Smooth manifolds, tangent spaces, embedding/immersion, Sard's theorem, Frobenius theorem. Differential forms, integration. 
Curvature, Gauss-Bonnet theorem. 
Time permitting: de Rham, duality in manifolds.
A detailed day by day plan can be found on [Canvas](here).

### Prerequisites ### 
Knowledge of basic point-set topology and multivariate calculus will be essential for this course. 
Students should also have completed Math 8301 or equivalent.

### Homework ### 
Homework will be assigned on weekly on [Canvas](https://erkaobao.github.io/math/teaching/2023_spring_8302).
Collaboration on homework is encouraged.

### Exams ###
There are one midterm exam and one final exam. Both exams are take home exams. No collaboration is allowed. You can use books or notes, but you are not allowed to use internet for the exams.
