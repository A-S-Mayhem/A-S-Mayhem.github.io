They will also learn a variety of methodologies for collecting data, as well as how to process and analyze their primary data. Furthermore, they will learn the various options for storing their data in archives and sharing it with the community. Students are expected to develop and explore a fieldwork project on an unfamiliar language within the methodological and theoretical framework presented in the course.
