This is a required introductory course for biological engineering and environmental engineering undergraduate students at Caltech. I designed a homework assignment about growth kinetics in a neurobiological background. Together with four other undergraduate teaching assistants, I held weekly office hours and TA meetings and monitored Piazza, an online Q&A platform for the course; graded homework and proctored examinations.
