In this lecture, you will learn how to do everything you already do as a scholar but in a more organized and efficient manner. More specifically, you will learn how to do all these things in RStudio.

1. Create a project in RStudio.
2. Create a R Markdown document.
3. Write math in your R Markdown document.
4. Organize a bibliography.

# Creating a project in RStudio

You are probably used to storing all your project-related files in a project folder on your computer. And, you may tell yourself that if you wanted to send all the files to your collaborator, you can zip that folder up and upload everything on to your Box or Dropbox. Then your collaborator can unzip that folder, work on some files, and re-upload the files. But then you don't know which parts she edited unless you read her email, which *might* be detailed, but also might not be!

So this is why creating a project in RStudio and connecting it to GitHub is important. All project files will be in a central location and all collaborators will go to the same central location. There is no convoluted re-uploading and downloading of any sort where edits may get lost in the process.

And, if you have no collaborators, you will be able to track your own work carefully so if you were ever to invite someone to review your project or bring on a collaborator, it wouldn't be much of a hassle.

You also want to think ahead: many of the top journals in the discipline require you to provide replication files. Instead of having to go back and retrace your steps, you can just provide your R Project directory. In essence, whoever has access to your R Project directory will be able to replicate every step that generated the final paper and results.

So let's get started.
