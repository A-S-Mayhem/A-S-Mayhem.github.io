To do: Add an abtract button https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/1633
Want to save anyone with a good website with features I want to copy

Want to keep the right hand side thing when I go to research page. For http://fhollenbach.org/pages/publications/ it stays, for working papers it doesn't

The footer is still weird

Need to add this to the config: 
teaser                   : # path of fallback teaser image, e.g. "/assets/images/500x300.png"

To make a blog section: go to /Users/jacklandry/Documents/GitHub/jacklandry.github.io/_data/navigation.yml and add a new header for blog, then add a pages thing in markdown for hyperlinks to the posts /Users/jacklandry/Documents/GitHub/jacklandry.github.io/pages then I think I can have html from the posts in R... not sure about that part..
