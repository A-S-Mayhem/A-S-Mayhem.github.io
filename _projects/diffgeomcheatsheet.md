Differential geometry (DG) is a field in math that studies how to create objects that are coordinate-system/representation invariant, a useful tool for many applications (including machine learning). When I started learning DG, I quickly found myself wanting a clear, concise reference manual for the important, and often hierarchical definitions found within the literature. This is my attempt at making one; a self-contained, quick and "to the point" cheat sheet of the important definitions and theorems found within DG, for use in applications such as general relativity, information geometry, and more. The cheatsheet is a work in progress, and can be found in .pdf form [here](https://github.com/nickk124/differentialgeometry-cheatsheet/blob/master/cheatsheet.pdf), built with [this code](https://github.com/nickk124/differentialgeometry-cheatsheet).
