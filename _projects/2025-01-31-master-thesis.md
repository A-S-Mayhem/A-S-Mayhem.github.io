title: "Master Thesis: On Riemannian Sharpness-Aware Minimization for General Loss Landscapes"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/riemannian-sam
excerpt: "<p style='text-align: justify'>The thesis investigates the sharpness-aware minimization literature and contributes to the literature by adding a reparameterization-invariant version that works for general loss landscape. The proposed method does not require a probabilistic model formulation or a pre-defined Riemannian manifold for working which FisherSAM and RiemannianSAM does, respectively.</p>"
