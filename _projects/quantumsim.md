Ever since Schrödinger first formulated his revolutionary theory describing the behavior of non-relativistic subatomic particles in terms of the newly invented wavefunction, ψ, the implications for modern physics have been nearly endless. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) compactly describes the evolution of a particle’s wavefunction, ψ, in the presence of a potential. While very powerful, Schrödinger’s equation is  only  directly  solvable  in  special  cases. For  this  reason,  accurate  and  efficient  numerical  methods  are an active area of research. We implemented two methods to solve the TDSE, and tested and compared our implementations on several systems with varying initial conditions and potentials, including some with known analytic solutions for comparison. I worked on this project with two classmates for our Physical Modeling course at UNC; our code is [here](https://github.com/nickk124/numericalschrodinger) and the project paper/writeup is [here](https://github.com/nickk124/numericalschrodinger/blob/master/Time_dependent_Schrodinger_FINAL_DRAFT.pdf).
