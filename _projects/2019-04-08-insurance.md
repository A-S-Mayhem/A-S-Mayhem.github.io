The H2020_Insurance Innovation Action Project is a truly collaborative, cross sector, pan European (and beyond) undertaking. 
The range of work packages (WP) is incredibly diverse from a multi-hazard, multi-risk model for the Danube, 
though to agricultural micro insurance in Tanzania. Experts are drawn from the following countries: France, 
United Kingdom, Germany, Hong Kong, Denmark, Austria, Hungary, The Netherlands, Spain, Kenya, and Serbia.

In the project, I am helping out my friends ([Prof. Maja Turk-Sekulic](http://www.ftn.uns.ac.rs/1417832298/maja-turk-sekulic) and [Prof. Jelena Radonic](http://www.ftn.uns.ac.rs/1417832172/jelena-radonic)) from the Department for Environmental Engineering of our Faculty and we 
are focusing on evaluating the potential risk of flooding and droughts on some crytical infrastructure of our home town.
