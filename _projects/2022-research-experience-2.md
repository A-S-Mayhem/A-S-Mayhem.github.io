## MAP:A new SNN training method

* Proposed an algorithm investigating the discretization problem in time-iteration and demonstrated the robustness of our algorithm under varying iterative step lengths.
* Proposed an SFA mode as an MSP implementation for efficient spike inference and robustness under this mode.
* Enhanced temporal expressiveness with a State-Free Synaptic Response Model (SFSRM) and is compatible with deep learning frameworks.
