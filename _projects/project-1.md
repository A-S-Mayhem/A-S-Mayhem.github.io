This two-axis rotary table is developed for integration into a multi-axis CNC milling machine. It was designed, manufactured and assembled by me, using a variety of custom machined parts and off-the-shelf components. Primary goals were to machine non-ferrous metals and plastics using 3+2 style and full 5-axis machining techniques. I have begun designing and building a full 5-axis CNC milling machine that will eventually use this rotary table. However, this page is dedicated to the two-axis rotary table project. This project provided an opportunity to learn more about machine design, electrical schematics and wiring, motor and gearbox sizing, servo tuning, pneumatics and systems integration.

###### Design

This two-axis tilting rotary table is designed to be compact and stiff (both moment stiffness and torsional stiffness). Primary components include:

1. Large diameter needle roller thrust bearings
2. Oversized crossed roller bearings
3. Harmonic drives (strain wave gear reducers)
4. AC Servo Motors
5. Trunnion style support bearing arrangement
6. Pneumatic brake for clamping

Shown below are several section views showing internal components and design elements:
