###### Design

This two-axis tilting rotary table is designed to be compact and stiff (both moment stiffness and torsional stiffness). Primary components include:

1. Large diameter needle roller thrust bearings
2. Oversized crossed roller bearings
3. Harmonic drives (strain wave gear reducers)
4. AC Servo Motors
5. Trunnion style support bearing arrangement
