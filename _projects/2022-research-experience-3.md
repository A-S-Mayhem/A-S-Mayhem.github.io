## Charge-domain CiM for Bayesian Neural Network

* Built a variable bit precision Neural Network Quantization method based on varational inference targeting flops
reduction
* Constructed a charge-domain SRAM-CIM for uncertainty-aware CNN Quantized by the above algorithm
* Suppose to gain great energy reduction with charge reuse and unstructured sparsity routing/zero skipping based on
workload charcteristic
