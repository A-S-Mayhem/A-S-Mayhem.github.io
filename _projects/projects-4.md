title: "Design and control of a ballbot (BSc Thesis and MSc side project."
excerpt: "Ballbots are inherently unstable devices they conserve their stability dynamically during their motion, similar to bipedal locomotion. Again similarly to bipedal locomotion, they allow designing tall robots with relatively small base area which is beneficial when designing robots that would interact with humans such as social and assistive robots. <br/><img src='/images/BallbotSim.gif'>"
