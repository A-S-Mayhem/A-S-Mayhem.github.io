My first foray into machine learning was when a friend and I created a pipeline for analyzing local Super Smash Bros Ultimate matches in real time. Assisted with a Raspberry Pi, we ran a text and object recognition program coupled with a camera in real time, that observes, records and analyzes data from the matches.
