During 2020, my undergraduate research advisor, a colleague and I worked on an empirical model (not from first principles; we leave that to the trained epidemiologists) for the doubling time of COVID-19. (The doubling time is the time that it takes for twice as many people to become infected with the virus.) We did this model-fitting using our TRK statistic (a suite of “worst case uncertainty” Bayesian model-fitting algorithms), as it is especially useful for this type of two-dimensional dataset with uncertainty not just in the datapoints (error bars), but within the dataset as a whole (global variance). We used a smoothly-broken linear model (with 5 linear segments, each for different regimes of the virus’ spread) that also accounted for the variable weekly case-reporting cycle.
