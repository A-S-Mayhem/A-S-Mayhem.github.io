In the \textsc{Deletion to induced matching} problem, we are given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and a non-negative integer $k$ and asks whether there exists a set of vertices $S \subseteq V(G) $ such that $|S|\le k$ and the size of any connected component in $G-S$ is \textit{exactly} 2. In this paper, we provide a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) $(O^*(1.748^{k})$ running time and polynomial space algorithm for the  \textsc{Deletion to induced matching} problem using \textit{branch}-and-\textit{reduce} strategy and path decomposition. We also extend our work to the exact-exponential version of the problem.
