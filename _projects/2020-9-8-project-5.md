In the **Deletion to induced matching** problem, we are given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and a non-negative integer $k$ and asks whether there exists a set of vertices $S \subseteq V(G) $ such that $\lvert S\rvert \le k $ and the size of any connected component in $G-S$ is <i>exactly</i> 2. In this paper, we provide a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) $O^*(1.748^{k}$ running time and polynomial space algorithm for the  <i> Deletion to induced matching</i> problem using <i>branch</i>-and-<i>reduce</i> strategy and path decomposition. We also extend our work to the exact-exponential version of the problem.
