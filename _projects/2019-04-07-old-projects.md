You can find a fairly complete list of projects I was involved in over the years in my CV. Suffice to say that usually there is a few things
going on, at the same time. Here I'll try to provide a more human readable description of what went on in my resarch activities.

My research activities started during my PhD, with two projects I was working on at FAU:
* Center for Coastline Security Technologies, US Federal Earmark Research Project, Florida Atlantic University, USA, 2004-2006.
* One Pass to Production, Motorola's sponsored research project, Florida Atlantic University, USA. 2003-2005.

The top one resulted in research that was the core of my PhD and was coordinated by my mentor [Prof. Borko Furht](http://www.cse.fau.edu/~borko/).
I am eternally grateful for the help of my other advisors [Prof. Oge Marques](https://www.ogemarques.com/), [Prof. Hari Kalva](http://www.cse.fau.edu/~hari/index.html), who 
steered me to computer vision and [Prof. Spyros Magliveras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyros_Magliveras), who introduced me to the 
wonderful world of cryptography. 

The "One Pass to Production" project was on a completely different note and focused on software/hardware co-desing and aspect-oriented programming, which
was a topic that I worked on under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Van Hilst](https://faculty.erau.edu/Michael.VanHilst). 

Once I got back to Serbia I started collaborating with my alma mater Department of Computer Engineering of the Faculty of Technical Sciences on
a Serbian National resarch project "Parallel processing for vector optimization in audio/video signal processing", as well as with the 
research group at the Department of lead by [Prof. Vladimir Crnojevic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ufPxvTkAAAAJ&hl=en) on
a large number of projects, some of which are:
* FP7-ENV Project ENORASIS (Grant Agreement 282949). The core aim of the project is to develop an integrated Decision Support System for environmentally optimized irrigation management by farmers and water management organizations based on advanced technologies and models, 2012 â€“ 2014, CO-PI for University of Novi Sad, Budget $2.66 million.
* Wireless Sensor Networks and Remote Sensing - Foundation of a modern agricultural infrastructure in the region, FP7 REGPOT as well as a Serbian National Technology Development Project.
* Video Content Analysis for Automated Traffic Surveillance, and EUREKA Project.

At the same time, as a young academic back from US and trying to build a network od EU collaborators I became a big fan of COST actions, 
as they are a great way for younger researchers to broaden their networks of collaborators, in the underfunded ecosystem of Serbian academia, 
so I've taken part in quite a few of those: 
* COST action CA15121 - MarCons: Advancing Marine Conservation in the European and Contiguous Seas. 
* COST action IC0903 - MOVE: Knowledge Discovery from Moving Objects.
* COST action IC0702 - SoftStat: Combining Soft Computing Techniques and Statistical Methods to Improve Data Analysis Solutions.	
* COST action TD1007 - Bimodal PET-MRI molecular imaging technologies and applications for in vivo monitoring of disease and biological processes. 

When it comes to COST, these days I try to take part in actions that require me to step out of my comfort zone. These days machine learning, 
computer vison and AI expertise can be applied to many fields, so it is not that hard to find a way to make myself useful. 

There have been other resaerch initiatives that I've taken part in over the years, but this should give you a good enough overview.
