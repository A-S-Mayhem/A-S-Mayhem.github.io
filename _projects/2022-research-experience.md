## Reconfigurable Neuromorphic RRAM-CIM for Spiking/non-spiking Transformer workload

* A reconfigurable hybrid-CiM is developed for video applications.
  * A bitline-sharing eDram-RRAM hybrid CiM is developed aimed to provide better throughput characteristic against the inherent variation of RRAM cell while taking advantage of the small footprint of RRAM storage and zero-leakage characteristic.
  * The bitline is reconfigurable to support 1.to differential amplifier/transmission gate for diff-frame operation and denoising.2.to ADC for DNN computations.
