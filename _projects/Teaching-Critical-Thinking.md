Critical thinking (CT) and logical reasoning (LR) skills are important for student success in college STEM courses. However, explicit instruction and assessment of critical and logical reasoning are generally not a part of introductory science classes. This project will address this disconnect by creating a broad and diverse network of educators and researchers, the aim of which will be to develop a robust set of print and digital course materials for helping students in introductory biology courses build these skills. The creation of high-quality resources that improve a vital educational pathway at a foundational stage will result in a better prepared and more diverse STEM-educated workforce.
