Custom 5-axis CNC milling machine designed to be compact and *portable*. Portable being a loose term, the machine is heavy, but the overall width constraint was <32" to fit through a standard man-door. This machine utilizes the custom designed and built 2-axis CNC tilting rotary table that I built previously.
