HandsOn-SEA is a single-degree-of-freedom educational robot that features series elastic actuation and relies on closed loop force control to achieve the desired level of safety and transparency during physical interactions. HandsOn-SEA complements the existing impedance-type Haptic Paddle designs by demonstrating the challenges involved in the synergistic design and control of admittance-type devices. HandsOn-SEA can be used to allow students to experience the performance trade-offs inherent in force control systems, due to the non-collocation between the force sensor and the actuator.
