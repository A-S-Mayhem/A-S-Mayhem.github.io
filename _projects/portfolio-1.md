Synopsis: This abstract explored the intricate interactions between land surface and atmosphere, with a specific emphasis on the water cycle's complexity and its impact on various physical processes. Numerical models are employed to quantify and predict water budgets, considering both resolved and unresolved processes. The study focuses on the expansion of sugarcane plantations in Brazil's Rio Grande basin and examines its effects on local hydrology and atmospheric response. A two-way coupled model is utilized, incorporating process-based hydrological modeling to understand the interplay between hydrology and the atmosphere.

My responsibilities involved the implementation of an atmospheric-hydrological modeling system and testing it against estimates from a well-known atmospheric model, satellite imagery, and observed data; the formulation of historical land use scenarios based on satellite images; calibration and validation the specific model parameters for sugarcane.

Outcomes: The results demonstrated that sugarcane expansion influences the water balance in the basin, while employing process-based hydrological modeling improves the representation of temperature, atmospheric water content, and wind patterns near the land surface. The study highlights the importance of water exchange between soil, land surface, and atmosphere in determining dominant processes during wet and dry seasons under agricultural land expansion.
