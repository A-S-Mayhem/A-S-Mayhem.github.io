### Introduction

The goal of the project was to design a new gearbox (transfer case) for use in the Baja SAE Student Design competition vehicle. All Baja vehicles must utilize the same Briggs & Stratton Model 20 - 305cc single cylinder four stroke engine. This engine has a low power output and limited useful RPM range (torque-speed and power-speed operating curves). One rule of the competition is that no performance modifications to the engine are allowed (no blueprinting, reducing flywheel mass, increasing idle or running RPM, etc). Therefore, reducing weight and size of the gearbox is the primary design goal, with a secondary goal of sizing the drivetrain components to handle all of the forces (internal and external) and reliably operate for a minimum ~25 hours of driving. Throughout the competition season the vehicle will be raced in three 4 hour endurance races, and a series of dynamic events, as well as any testing required by the team developing vehicle subsystems.
