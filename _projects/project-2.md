### Introduction

The goal of the project was to design a new gearbox (transfer case) for use in the University of Waterloo Baja SAE student design competition vehicle. All Baja vehicles must utilize the same Briggs & Stratton Model 20 - 305cc single cylinder four stroke engine. This engine has a low power output and limited useful RPM range (torque-speed and power-speed operating curves). One rule of the competition is that no performance modifications to the engine are allowed (no blueprinting, reducing flywheel mass, increasing governor speed, etc). Therefore, reducing weight and size of the gearbox is the primary design objective, with a secondary objective of optimizing the drivetrain components to handle all of the forces (internal and external) for reliable operation throughout the course of a race season. Throughout the competition season the vehicle will be raced in three 4 hour endurance races, and a series of dynamic events, as well as any testing required by the team developing vehicle subsystems. All of this driving, racing and testing time is about 25 hours.

### Design & Features

Being a student design team, finances are always tight and securing team sponsorships from local suppliers, shops and the university is critical. Some of the design was driven by available sponsors and the level of financial support or in-kind support they could provide.

Some design constraints and requirements were:

- Gearbox and brake assembly must be less than 20 lbs [9 kg] - reduction in weight of the entire vehicle was a big goal for 2016 & 2017
- Be easier to assemble, service and actually install in vehicle compared to past versions
- Utilize bearings, seals and other required components available from team sponsor SKF
- Input shaft to be compatible with Gaged Engineering GX9 CVT
- Increase vehicle drive torque via one-stage or two-stage gear reduction (ideal ratio of 8:1 to 12:1 based on past vehicle designs, top speed, power and calculations)
- Work with team sponsor ODG for designing and manufacturing gears and shafts
- Handle all engine and drive train loads (impulse and shock loads)

Final layout of shafts and gearbox housing pictured below. This design is a 2-piece housing sealed with a oil-resistant gasket sheet, cut to exact dimensions on a laser cutter. The engineering machine shop was able to program (CAM) and machine the aluminum housings. Our team sponsor ODG manufactured the gear and shafts to our specifications after many design iterations, gear calculations, optimizing the geometry for performance and manufacturability.
