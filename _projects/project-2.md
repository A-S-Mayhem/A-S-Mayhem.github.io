### Introduction

The goal of the project was to design a new gearbox (transfer case) for use in the University of Waterloo Baja SAE student design competition vehicle. All Baja vehicles must utilize the same Briggs & Stratton Model 20 - 305cc single cylinder four stroke engine. This engine has a low power output and limited useful RPM range (torque-speed and power-speed operating curves). One rule of the competition is that no performance modifications to the engine are allowed (no blueprinting, reducing flywheel mass, increasing governor speed, etc). Therefore, reducing weight and size of the gearbox is the primary design objective, with a secondary objective of optimizing the drivetrain components to handle all of the forces (internal and external) for reliable operation for a minimum ~25 hours of driving. Throughout the competition season the vehicle will be raced in three 4 hour endurance races, and a series of dynamic events, as well as any testing required by the team developing vehicle subsystems. All of this driving, racing and testing time is about 25 hours.

The design constraints and requirements were:

- Gearbox and brake assembly must be less than 20 lbs [9 kg]
- Be easier to assemble, seal fluids, perform maintenance and install in vehicle compared to past versions
- Utilize bearings, seals and other required components available from team sponsor SKF
- Meet requirements for Gaged Engineering CVT
- Increase vehicle drive torque via one-stage or two-stage gear reduction
- Work with team sponsor ODG for designing and manufacturing gears and shafts
- Handle all engine and drive train loads (impulse and shock loads from impacts and rough terrain)
