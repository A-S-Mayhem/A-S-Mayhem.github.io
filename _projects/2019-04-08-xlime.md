xLiMe (full name crossMedia crossLingual Knowledge extraction) was an FP7, Resarch and Innovation Action (RIA) project that I had the pleasure working on during my postdoctoral stay with the MHUG group of [Prof. Nicu Sebe](http://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/) at the University of Trento. I worked on object recognition and text extraction (OCR) from IPTV streams, as well helped with dissemination activities. I should also note that our work has been supported by the grant of two Tesla K40 GPUs from NVIDIA. 

The project was coordinated by our collegue and friend [Dr. Achim Rettinger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a5WsBc0AAAAJ&hl=en), who is as of recently a professor at the University of Trier.
