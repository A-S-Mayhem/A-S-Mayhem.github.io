QoSTREAM (full name Video Quality Driven Multimedia Streaming in Mobile Wireless Networks) was an FP7 project that involved 8 Universities from Europe, Africa, Asia, South and North America. We wanted to devise a system that would optimize video streaming based on the estimation of the quality perceived by the user. I coordinated the project, but it was envisioned together with my colleague and friend [Prof. Dejan Vukobratovic](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=MugUYHgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
