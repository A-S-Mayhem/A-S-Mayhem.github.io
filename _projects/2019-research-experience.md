## Polarizationâ€”sensitive achromatic metalenses

* Designed and developed the FDTD script code of the layout of the monochromatic metalenses.
* Therotically analyzed the principle of achromatic metalenses and swept the parameters.
* Optimized the metalens and compared it with the monochromatic ones and conducted a report about it.
* The focus of lens remained unchanged when the input is 300nm-700nm.
