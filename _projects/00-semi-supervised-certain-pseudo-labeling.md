excerpt: "![semi-supervised-certain-pseudo-labeling](/images/sscpl.png){: style='float: left; width:380px'} Employing uncertanty estimation in pseudo-labelling for semi-supervised image classification methods (Fix-Match). As [Vanilla Fix-Match](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07685) can suffer from overconfident pseudo-labels, we propose to employ active learning techniques to choose more confidently pseudo-labelled images from unlabelled pool. Experimenting with different uncertainty estimators MC Dropout / Spectral Normalisation & GMMs and uncertainty strategies."
