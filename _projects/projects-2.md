- **Technologies**: Python, PySpark, AWS EMR, Spark Operator, Databricks, RESTful APIs, Kafka, PostgreSQL, FHIR
- **Description**: The FHIR Data Transformation Tool is an advanced solution designed to convert healthcare data into
  the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, promoting seamless data exchange across diverse
  healthcare systems.
- **My Role**: Designed and implemented a **FHIR** (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data transformation tool
  to facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of healthcare data in compliance with FHIR standards.
  The tool allowed seamless access to patient data via RESTful APIs, ensuring interoperability between different
  healthcare systems.
- **Key Contributions**:
    - Developed data transformation pipelines using **PySpark** and **pandas** for efficient transformation of large
      datasets into the FHIR format.
    - Leveraged **AWS EMR** and **Spark Operator** to orchestrate complex ETL workflows across multiple environments,
      enabling automated data syncing between different systems.
    - Integrated **Kafka** for real-time data streaming to ensure low-latency updates between systems.
    - Deployed RESTful APIs for external access to FHIR-compliant data using **Django**, improving the performance of
      querying patient data.
    - I developed a proof of concept, After conducting extensive research on various Spark deployment toolsâ€”including
      Databricks, AWS EMR, Azure
      HDInsight, and the Kubernetes Spark Operator. Based on a comparative analysis of the results, we opted for **Spark
      Operator** and **AWS EMR** for deployment, prioritizing **cost-effectiveness** and
      efficiency.
