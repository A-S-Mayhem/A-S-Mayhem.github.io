title: "Realistic generation of synthetic pediatric liver ultrasound images for liver disease classification"
excerpt: "Large-scale labeled biomedical datasets are difficult to access, and these datasets remain small in the medical imaging domain compared to other common computer visiom datasets. Therefore, we presented a method of using different models of generative adversarial networks to generate synthetic liver ultrasound images. Our results showed that the synthetic images had good quality compared with the real images, and this synthetic dataset would be promising as a data augmentation method for liver disease classification task."
