excerpt: "![GCN-align](/images/patent-similarity.png){: style='float: left; width: 395px'} Filing patents is a messy process. Applicants need to ensure their patent does not infringe upon other tens of millions of existing patents. This project aims to automate the search of similar patents. 
<br/> Measuring, visualising and comparing patent similarities with metadata such as IPC tags. We aim to explore multiple similarity measures (textual, IPC tags, x-citations, graphical, etc), assess correlations, and visualise our findings to draw conclusions."
