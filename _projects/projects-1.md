Molecular Communications via Diffusion (MCvD) is a communications scheme, where the information is transmitted through the free-diffusion of carrier molecules. In our research, the communications system was designed as On-Off Keying (OOK). That is, if the number of carrier molecules that have arrived to the receiver exceeds a threshold value, then the transmitted bit will be 1. Otherwise, it is 0. 

In this communications scheme, there are two major issues: Inter-symbol Interference (ISI) and Inter-link Interference (ILI). The former occurs when the carrier molecules arrive to the receiver later than the specific time interval for decision. The latter occurs, on the other hand, when carrier molecules of different receptors arrive to other receptors. Both ISI and ILI might cause misleading decisions; hence, should be reduced with changes in system design.
