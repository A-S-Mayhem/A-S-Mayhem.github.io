title: "Nature-inspired metamaterial-based shape-changing interfaces"
excerpt: "This project page shows sparsely actuated metamaterial systems for designing nature-inspired shape-changing interfaces. The presented structures are manufactured by 3D printing and enhanced by modular add-ons. This project aims to help designers to design and simulate the presented structures before construction and provide guidance on modular enhancements after construction.
