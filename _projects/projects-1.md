- **Technologies**: Python, FastAPI, Kafka, AWS, Azure, Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch
- **Description**: The Interoperability System Healthcare is a sophisticated interoperability solution designed to
  streamline **Application interactions** to different **EHR Systems** in real time, **automate update** of various
  modules such as vitals, coding systems, lab results, document references etc. and medical
  information retrieval. It also leverages basic ML models to identify coding gaps and help Providers to provide useful
  data to close the gaps. Tailored specifically for the interchanging data between application and industry leading EHR
  systems, this service uses **kafka** to receive and respond to Provider inputs in real-time, improving overall service
  efficiency.
- **My Role**: Spearheaded the development of project designed to handle multiple providers from different EHR systems
  for appointment scheduling, data updation and interaction automation. The service was built using **Python** and *
  *FastAPI**, leveraging **Kafka Queuing Service** for to process the data in realtime queries. The system utilized *
  *kubernetes** for deployment, ensuring scalable and cost-efficient operations.
- **Key Contributions**:
    - Implemented real-time conversational workflows with **Redis** as the in-memory database for managing session
      states.
    - Integrated **PostgreSQL** for patient data management and **Elasticsearch** for fast, indexed search queries.
    - Deployed the solution using **Kubernetes** containers on **AWS** and **Azure** for a multi-cloud architecture,
      enabling high availability and fault tolerance.
