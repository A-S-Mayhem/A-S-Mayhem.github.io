Black-grass is a native annual grass weed that can be found all over the United Kingdom, but is most widespread in the cereal-growing areas of southern and eastern England.  Black-grass has become a major headache for many farmers due to its prevalence over autumn-sown arable crops and herbicide resistance. 
The aim of our research is to develop a computer vision-based weed detection system that can reliably detect black-grass in cereal crops. To accomplish this, we use two machine learning tools: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are well-known image recognition systems that have demonstrated outstanding performance in a variety of applications. 
However, CNNs require large datasets to train, and collecting such a dataset for each field is not practical. To meet this challenge, we'll use GANs, which generate synthetic images based on factors like growth stage and soil type. 
The novelties in our research come from the fact that we would like to design an end-to-end ML model for both data augmentation and weed classification and train it with a new type of dataset collected from cereal fields.
