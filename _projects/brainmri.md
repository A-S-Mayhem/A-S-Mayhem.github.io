title: "Quality control of brain tumor segmentations"
excerpt: "Deep learning models have been extensively developed for brain tumor segmentations from MRI images, mostly in a supervised way where ground truth labels are available. However, this condition is not warranted in datasets that do not have ground truth annotations. In this work, we developed a novel method that predicted the Dice score of the tumor segmentations without the ground truth, while also generating the error map that highlighted the areas where the predicted segmentation and the ground truth disagreed."
