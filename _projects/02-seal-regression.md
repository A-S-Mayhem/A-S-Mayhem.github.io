title: "Linear Regression on Homomorphic Encrypted Data"
link: 'https://gitlab.com/PranavRai/patent-similarity-siemens'
excerpt: "![secure_ML_scheme](/images/secure_ML_scheme.png){: style='float: left; width: 395px'} The aim of this project is to perform Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, namely Linear Regression, on the ciphertext and evaluate its performance and usability. We use gradient descent in order to find LR coefficient estimates, as this algorithm does not require division. 
<br/> We used Microsoft SEAL C++ library and its Python wrapper - PySEAL. SEAL uses the Fan-Vercauteren homomorphic encryption scheme - Somewhat Fully Homomorphic scheme."
