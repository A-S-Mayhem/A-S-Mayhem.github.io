Middleware for Data-Intensive Analytics and Science (MIDAS) will support new programming and execution models for data-intensive analysis
in a wide range of science and engineering applications. The long term science objective of MIDAS is to
provide a scalable runtime system and appropriate resource management abstractions enabling [SPIDAL](www.spidal.org) libraries.
MIDAS will be responsible for the underlying resource management middleware and heterogeneous
infrastructure access layer which will support streaming based applications to also exploit SPIDAL libraries
to work efficiently across application types, over a range of resources.
