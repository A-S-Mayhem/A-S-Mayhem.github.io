[GTSfM](https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm) is a global Structure from Motion (SfM) library which estimates 3D structure and camera motion from a collection of images. It is designed to support parallelized computation on a cluster, but can also be used on standalone devices.  

Some of its key features are the following:

- State-of-the-art deep feature extraction and feature matching for two-view relative pose estimation.
- Robust rotation averaging, translation averaging and bundle adjustment using factor graphs, implemented with [GTSAM](https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm).
- A deep multi-view stereo pipeline to estimate dense 3D structure.
- Support for parallelizing computation on distributed infrastructure using [Dask](https://dask.org/).


The library is open-sourced, and can be used from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm)
