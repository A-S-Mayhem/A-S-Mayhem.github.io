<h2> Projects </h2>

<h3>Design and Structural Analysis of 3D anti-vortex tube (AVT)</h3>
<br>
Client: Pratt & Whitney
<br>
Project Details:
The main objective of this project was to optimize the design of AVT assembly which did not meet the life criteria.
<br>
Role:
Prepared the finite element (FE) model of 3D AVT assembly within 2D high pressure compressor (HPC) assembly on Ansys V14.5
In order to explore the model as a whole, 2D and 3D were modelled in combination. Next, the boundary conditions and loads were applied for the critical time points of MTGW and AD27 missions for life and for burst margin calculations. inear static stress analysis was conducted for the crucial time points across various design iterations and material combinations of the AVT assembly to address and rectify the design issues. 
To conduct the thermal analysis, the sub-modeling concept was employed. Thermal loads were extracted from the model featuring the HPC alone and then transferred to the 3D components of the AVT assembly. 
A comprehensive result presentation and stress summary for the AVT assembly were compiled and the status was communicated to senior management through the use of burndown and dashboard charts.
