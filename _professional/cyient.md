<h2> Projects </h2>
<h3>Design and Structural Analysis of 3D anti-vortex tube (AVT)</h3>
Client: Pratt & Whitney
Project Details:
The main objective of this project was to optimize the design of AVT assembly which did not meet the life criteria.
Role:
Prepared the finite element (FE) model of 3D AVT assembly within 2D high pressure compressor (HPC) assembly on Ansys V14.5
In order to explore the model as a whole, 2D and 3D were modelled in combination. Next, the boundary conditions and loads were applied for the critical time points of MTGW and AD27 missions for life and for burst margin calculations. inear static stress analysis was conducted for the crucial time points across various design iterations and material combinations of the AVT assembly to address and rectify the design issues. 
To conduct the thermal analysis, the sub-modeling concept was employed. Thermal loads were extracted from the model featuring the HPC alone and then transferred to the 3D components of the AVT assembly. 
A comprehensive result presentation and stress summary for the AVT assembly were compiled and the status was communicated to senior management through the use of burndown and dashboard charts.

<h3>Structural Analysis on BA, 30k engines IBR 5 to 8 components</h3>
Project Details :
The main objective of this project was to optimize the design of AVT assembly which was not meeting the life criteria.
Role:
Prepared the FE model of 3D AVT (Anti Vortex tube) assembly within 2D HPC assembly on Ansys V14.5
2D and 3D combination modeling and applying boundary conditions is an opportunity to explore the model behavior as a whole. Application of Boundary conditions and loads was for the critical time points of MTGW and AD27 missions for life and for burst margin calculations. Linear static stress analysis was carried out for the critical time points of distinctive design iterations/different material combinations of AVT assembly to fix the design. The sub-modeling concept was used to take thermals for 3D components from the "HPC alone" model. Detailed result pitch and Stress summary on AVT assembly were prepared.
