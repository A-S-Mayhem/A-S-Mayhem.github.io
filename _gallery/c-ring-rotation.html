<b>Movie of the c-ring rotation from an all-atom MD simulation.</b> 

For clarity, I selected and ordered frames from an 8 Âµs simulation 
using an Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) bias on the rotation angle. 
This gives the impression that rotation proceeds in a smooth, 
progressive fashion; this is great for illustration, 
but one should remember the actual process is much more stochastic !
