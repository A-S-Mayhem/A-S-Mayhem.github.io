## Abstract

Are Western European countries successfully incorporating their immigrant populations? Past research efforts are abundant but fragmented. Together, they yield a mixed picture of either worse, comparable or better outcomes in schools, neighborhoods and labor markets among the children of immigrants compared to native populations. In this paper, we approach immigrant incorporation as a process of intergenerational social mobility and argue that social mobility trajectories are uniquely suited to measure assimilation and gauge the influence of immigrant origins on life chances. We analyze absolute and relative levels of intergenerational mobility among second-generation and native populations in seven European countries, and report two major findings. First, we document a master trend of assimilation, in which the destiny of the second generation is primarily determined by its social class - rather than immigrant - background. Class of origin strongly shapes class of destination among the second generation, as it does among natives, and with remarkable consistency across countries. Second, disaggregating mobility outcomes by regional origins reveals relatively strong patterns of ``perverse openness" at the top, whereby the children of African immigrants from elite occupational backgrounds do not benefit from social reproduction as much as natives and other immigrants of similar social class, and are more likely to experience downward mobility.
