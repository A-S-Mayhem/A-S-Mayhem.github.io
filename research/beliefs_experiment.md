## Abstract

Growing disparities of income and wealth have prompted extensive survey research to measure the effects on public beliefs about the causes and fairness of economic outcomes. However, observational data confounds responses to unequal outcomes with highly correlated inequality of opportunity. This study uses a card-game experiment to disentangle these two sources of influence on cognitive, normative and affective responses: cognitive beliefs about the attribution of success and failure to talent, luck, and opportunity; normative beliefs about the fairness of the game; and emotional satisfaction with the outcome. Participants were randomly assigned to positions with unequal opportunities for success on a playing field tilted to the benefit of previous winners versus losers. Results showed that participants regarded the redistribution of opportunity as unfair, regardless of whether the policy was progressive or regressive, and even when they benefited personally. However, winners and losers differed sharply on the relative importance of talent versus luck, the fairness of the game, and emotional satisfaction with the outcome. In short, it’s not just how the game is played, it’s also whether you win or lose.
