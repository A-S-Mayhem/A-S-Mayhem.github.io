## Abstract

Growing disparities of income and wealth have prompted extensive survey research to measure the effects on public beliefs about the causes and fairness of economic inequality. However, observational data confound responses to unequal outcomes with highly correlated inequality of opportunity. This study uses a novel card-game experiment to disentangle the effects of unequal outcomes and unequal opportunities on cognitive, normative and affective responses: cognitive beliefs about the attribution of success and failure to talent, luck, and opportunity; normative beliefs about the fairness of the game; and emotional satisfaction with the outcome. Participants were randomly assigned to positions with unequal opportunities for success on a level playing field and on a playing field tilted to the benefit of previous winners or losers. Results showed that both winners and losers were less likely to view the outcomes as fair or attributable to skill as the level of redistribution increased, whether the redistribution was progressive or regressive or personally benefited the participant, but this effect of redistribution was stronger for winners. Moreover, winners were generally more likely than losers to believe the game was fair, even in the most regressive condition in which the playing field was most heavily tilted in their favor. In short, it’s not just how the game is played, it’s also whether you win or lose.
