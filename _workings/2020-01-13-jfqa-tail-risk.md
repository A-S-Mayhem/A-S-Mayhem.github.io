Risk adjustment is based on a nonparametric estimation of the state price density that tilts the return distribution to satisfy the Euler equation. Empirically, our daily tail risk premium factor extracted from intra-day S\&amp;P 500 returns consistently forecasts the future distribution of market returns, including the mean, higher moments and a large range of quantiles.

## Abstract

This paper proposes a new measure of tail risk premium obtained from high-frequency stock returns. Risk adjustment is based on a nonparametric estimation of the state price density that tilts the return distribution to satisfy the Euler equation. Empirically, our daily tail risk premium factor extracted from intra-day S\&amp;P 500 returns consistently forecasts the future distribution of market returns, including the mean, higher moments and a large range of quantiles. Among established benchmark measures of tail and variance risk, it appears as the most significant predictor for expected returns on a cross-section of characteristic-based portfolios. Moreover, it is also a robust predictor of the variance risk premia suggesting that investors&apos; aversion to downside risk is also an important determinant of risk premium in high frequency markets.
