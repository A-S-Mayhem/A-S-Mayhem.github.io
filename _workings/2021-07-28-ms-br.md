## Abstract

We propose a model-free method for measuring the jump skewness risk premium via a trading strategy. We find that in the S&amp;P 500 option market, the premium is positive and greater in absolute terms than the variance premium. The trading strategy  llows for examining the premium in different holding periods: daytime, when markets are open, and overnight, outside of trading hours. We demonstrate that both premia vary considerably between trading and non-trading periods, and also increase in   riods of market distress. The daytime return on jump skewness is not spanned by other systematic risk factors, suggesting it is a systematic risk factor itself. Outside of trading hours, skewness risk does not seem to be distinguishable from variance risk.  We  lso decompose total return skewness into a jump component, and a signed variance component, and demonstrate that only the jump component is priced. Our work also sketches a new set of stylized facts about variance and jump skewness premia that  option pricing models should match.
