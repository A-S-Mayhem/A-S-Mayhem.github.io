***The VLSP Consortium regroups all academic and industrial research teams involved in Vietnamese language and speech processing. The very first kick-off meeting of this community was in 2005, organized at the Institute of Information Technology, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology. VLSP shared-tasks aim at promoting the most efficient methods for these important tools. The organization of these campaigns with sponsorships from academia and industry permit to build and offer to the VLSP community gold datasets for training and testing Vietnamese text and speech processing systems.***
