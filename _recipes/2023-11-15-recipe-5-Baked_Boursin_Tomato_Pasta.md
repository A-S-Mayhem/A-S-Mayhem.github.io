###### Ingredients

- 1 Box [Boursin Garlic & Fine Herbs](https://www.boursin.com/product/garlic-fine-herbs/)
- 1 lb Grape Tomatoes
- 1 Medium Shallot, minced
- 3 Cloves Garlic, minced
- ½ Cup Fresh Basil Leaves, Sliced
- 3 tbsp Olive Oil
- 1 Pinch Kosher Salt
- 1 Pinch Black Pepper
- ¼ tsp Red Pepper Flakes, or more if you prefer more spice
- 4 Servings Pasta of Choice
- OPTIONAL:
  - 8oz Portabella or Cremini Mushrooms, torn
  - 3 cups Fresh Spinach
  - 2 tbsp Olive Oil
  - 1 Pinch Kosher Salt
  - 1 Pinch Black Pepper


###### Instructions

1. Preheat Oven to 400F.
2. Unwrap & place Boursin Cheese in the center of an 8x12’ ovenproof baking dish.
3. Wash tomatoes and place around cheese.
4. Mince shallot & garlic, and slice basil. Sprinkle around cheese.
5. Top with olive oil, salt, pepper & red pepper flakes. Bake for 15 min or until you see the tomatoes start to take on color & some have slightly split or burst. Remove & set aside.
6. While your cheese is baking, cook pasta in salted water. Start optional topping if using.
7. Optional topping: tear mushrooms in to small bite size pieces, heat olive oil in frying pan over medium heat and sauté mushrooms until they have browned, about 5-8 minutes. Add spinach, salt & pepper, and cook until spinach has just wilted, about 1-2 minutes. Combine with cheese mixture in baking dish.
8. Top cheese and tomato mixture with drained pasta, stir to incorporate and serve hot.
9. Tip - Try with other Boursin flavors: Basil & Chive, Shallot & Chive, Cracked Black Pepper. For a smoother version, blend cheese mixture in blender prior to serving!
