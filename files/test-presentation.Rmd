# Econometrics

## Intro

### Introduction

What conveys the study of econometrics?

The unification of three main areas:

1.    Statistics
2.    Economic theory
3.    Mathematics

\`\`Econometrics conveys application of mathematical statistics and the tools of statistical inference to the empirical measurement of relationships postulated by an underlying theory."

### The Big Data Revolution

Into a new paradigm?



### The practice of econometrics

This course is designed to the user rather than developer!

### Econometric Modeling

Until chapter 2, section 2.2.
