# Econometrics

## Intro

### Introduction

 What conveys the study of econometrics?

\vfill

The unification of three main areas:

    1.    Statistics
    2.    Economic theory
    3.    Mathematics
  
\vfill

\`\`Econometrics conveys application of mathematical statistics and the tools of statistical inference to the empirical measurement of relationships postulated by an underlying theory."

## The practice of econometrics

### The practice of econometrics

Theoretical econometrics vs. applied econometrics

 
  
\hspace{3cm} This course is designed for the applied economist. 

\hspace{3cm} Applied econometric methods will be used for estimation of important quantities, analysis of economic outcomes such as policy changes, markets or individual behavior, testing theories, and for forecasting.

## Econometric Modeling

### Econometric Modeling

 Consider the Keynesian consumption function: $C=f(X)$, where $X$ is disposable income.
  
\vfill

 Theoretical postulates: $dC/dX$ is positive and $0<dC/dX<1$.

\vfill

 Implications:
  
  
  1. $MPC>0$
  
  
  2. $APC=C/X$ falls with income
  
  
  3. $d(C/X)/dX=(MPC-APC)/X<0$ $\rightarrow$ $MPC<APC$
  
### Keynes' Consumption Funcion

How do we test this theory? \pause

\vfill

Estimate the equation $C=\alpha + \beta X$ and test whether $\alpha>0$ and $0<\beta<1$.

\vfill

Some points to note:


  1. Notice the behavioral aspect of the model.


  2. The model states an unambiguous and deterministic relationship between the dependent and independent variables.


  3. Models are only simplifications of reality; we need an stochastic element.


  4. A probabilistic model is less precise but more robust!
  

  
### From the Model to the Real World

### From the Model to the Real World

The next step is to include a random component: $C=F(X,\varepsilon)$
    
    
  We usually assume an additive relationship.

\vfill

We also need to consider the wartime period into the empirical model.

  
  Here's an empirical model: $$C=\alpha+\beta X+ d_{waryears}\delta_W+\varepsilon$$

### Another Example

How would you model the function $earnings=f(education)$?
