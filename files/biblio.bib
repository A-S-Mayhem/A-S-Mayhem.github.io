abstract = {Impairments in performing activities of daily living occur early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a great need to develop non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions likely to reduce dependency in everyday activities in AD patients. This study investigated whether it was possible to increase autonomy in these patients in cooking activities using interventions based on errorless learning, vanishing-cue, and virtual reality techniques. We recruited a 79-year-old woman who met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. She was trained in four cooking tasks for four days per task, one hour per day, in virtual and in real conditions. Outcome measures included subjective data concerning the therapeutic intervention and the experience of virtual reality, repeated assessments of training activities, neuropsychological scores, and self-esteem and quality of life measures. The results indicated that our patient could relearn some cooking activities using virtual reality techniques. Transfer to real life was also observed. Improvement of the task performance remained stable over time. This case report supports the value of a non-immersive virtual kitchen to help people with AD to relearn cooking activities.},

As recommended, new interactive tools must be accessible to users, acceptable, easy to use, motivating and useful for both residents and staff. Virtual Reality is a good candidate to fulfill these specifications. Based on our expertise in Human Computer Interaction and Neuropsychology of ageing, we are developing a platform to offer interactive activities adapted to very-old and dependent people living in nursing homes. It is based on the use of a low-cost markerless RGB-D sensor (AstraTM, Orbbec) to track user body motion. Implemented activities were designed to involve various cognitive abilities, such as sorting game, search game, ball game. In addition, a module records several biomechanical data and generates reports for caregivers. This paper aims to discuss the special needs of research context and to present the designed interaction platform.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is a scientific and technical domain that can provide mediums to dive users into an interactive 3D computer-generated world. Several processes of immersion bring to user the feeling of having quit the real world and of being present in the virtual environment, physically as well as psychologically (1,2). VR must provide a coherent experience in terms of sensory, cognitive and functional information (2). Fidelity, as the objective degree of exactness with which a system reproduces real-world, is hence a key point to design immersive VR-based systems. Since the 2010's, low-cost cave automatic virtual environment (3) and many Head-Mounted Display (HMD) are available for immersive VR. However, navigate through 3D environments displayed in HMD is still challenging because it can cause sickness and disorientation. Since techniques based on haptic devices like keyboard and joystick have been extensively explored in the past, the present study aimed to investigate the impact of the navigation technique on performance on a simple traveling-centered task and the user experience with the HMD HTC Vive. Since techniques based on haptic devices like keyboard and joystick have been extensively explored in the past, the present study aimed to investigate the impact of the navigation technique on performance on a simple traveling-centered task and the user experience with the HMD HTC Vive. We compared four continuous navigation techniques: Arms Swinging, Walking-In-Place, Pointing and Touchpad. Results on the learning effect indicated that the repetition was especially beneficial for Directional Touchpad. On the user experience, the results revealed a general discomfort of attendees with the presented systems, but they found themselves competent at the end of the experiment in the accomplishment of the proposed task. Joysticks or directional was associated to a failure in using the gaze to orientate the camera view in virtual reality.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes impairments affecting instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Transdisciplinary research in neuropsychology and virtual reality has fostered the development of ecologically valid virtual tools for the assessment of IADL, using simulations of real life activities. Few studies have examined the benefits of this approach in AD patients. Our aim was to examine the utility of a non-immersive virtual coffee task (NI-VCT) for assessment of IADL in these patients. We focus on the assessment results obtained from a group of 24 AD patients on a task designed to assess their ability to prepare a virtual cup of coffee, using a virtual coffee machine. We compared performance on the virtual task to an identical daily living task involving the actual preparation of a cup of coffee, as well as to global cognitive, executive, and caregiver-reported IADL functioning. Relative to 32 comparable, healthy elderly (HE) controls, AD patients performed worse than HE controls on all tasks. Correlation analyses revealed that NI-VCT measures were related to all other neuropsychological measures. Moreover, regression analyses demonstrated that performance on the NI-VCT predicted actual task performance and caregiver-reported IADL functioning. Our results provide initial support for the utility of our virtual kitchen for assessment of IADL in AD patients. Copyright {\textcopyright} INS.Published by Cambridge University Press, 2014.},

The task consisted in learning a virtual path of a 3D model of a real city, with either one of these four conditions: Joystick / Treadmill Vs Manual Rotation / Automatic Rotation. We assessed spatial knowledge with six spatial restitution tasks. To assess the interfaces used, we analyzed also the interaction data acquired during the learning path. Our results show that the direct control of rotations has different effects, depending on the motor activity required by the input modality. The quality of spatial representation increases with the Treadmill when rotations are enabled. With the Joystick, controlling the rotations affect spatial representations. We discuss our findings in terms of cognitive, sensorimotor processes and human computer interaction issues. {\textcopyright} 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effects of body-centred information on the transfer of spatial learning using a wayfinding task and tasks that specifically probe the route and survey strategies of navigation. The subject learned a route in either a real or a virtual environment (VE; 3D scale model of a Bordeaux neighbourhood) and then reproduced it in the real environment. The involvement of body-based information was manipulated across the spatial learning conditions in the VE: participants learned with full body-based information (treadmill with rotation), with the translational component only (treadmill without rotation) or without body-based information (joystick). In the wayfinding task, the results showed a significant effect of the learning environment with the best scores obtained in the real and treadmill with rotation conditions. There was no significant difference between these two conditions, but the real condition was significantly different from the treadmill without rotation and joystick conditions. Also, the visual flow was sufficient to successfully perform the two egocentric tasks used as well as a direction estimation task (a survey task), in so far as there is no significant difference between the joystick and the treadmill conditions. By contrast, the distance estimates were improved by the treadmill condition including the translational component (but not the rotational component). Finally, our results show that treadmill with rotation promotes the transfer of spatial learning from a virtual to a real environment (compared to joystick and treadmill without rotation). Moreover, body-centred informations are more involved in allocentric (distance estimates) than egocentric navigational strategies.$\backslash$nThis study investigated the effects of body-centred information on the transfer of spatial learning using a wayfinding task and tasks that specifically probe the route and survey strategies of navigation.

abstract = {The early neuropsychological assessment tools have been developed with the construct validity of the measure as a primary consideration. Such traditional tests are known to provide objective and standardized measure. However, they use specialized and decontextualized exercises which break the functioning unity of the multiple cognitive capacities. Thus, tests based on process-oriented exercises have been developed, such as the Zoo Map Test. By soliciting various capacities to solve a practical problem, this test brings an interesting framework to assess multiple aspects of the planning. This test has shown its usefulness in various clinical populations. However, additional investigations are needed to understand planning behaviors in more details and measure them with improved accuracy and ecological validity. To his end, we converted this paper-and-pencil test into a Virtual Reality-based assessment tool of planning. This paper describes the difficulties and the limits as well as the new opportunities in converting a 2D map consisting of roads and places into a 3D virtual environment.},

abstract = {Everyday action impairment is one of the diagnostic criteria of Alzheimer's disease and is associated with many serious consequences, including loss of functional autonomy and independence. It has been shown that the (re)learning of everyday activities is possible in Alzheimer's disease by using error reduction teaching approaches in naturalistic clinical settings. The purpose of this study is to develop a dual-modal virtual reality platform for training in everyday cooking activities in Alzheimer's disease and to establish its value as a training tool for everyday activities in these patients. Two everyday tasks and two error reduction learning methods were implemented within a virtual kitchen. Two patients with Alzheimer's disease and two healthy elderly controls were tested. All subjects were trained in two learning sessions on two comparable cooking tasks. Within each group (i.e., patients and controls), the order of the training methods was counterbalanced. Repeated measure analysis before and after learning was performed. A questionnaire of presence and a verbal interview were used to obtain information about the subjective responses of the participants to the VR experience. The results in terms of errors, omissions, and perseverations (i.e., repetitive behaviors) indicate that the patients performed worse than the controls before learning, but that they reached a level of performance similar to that of the controls after a short learning session, regardless of the learning method employed. This finding provides preliminary support for the value of the dual-modal virtual reality platform for training in everyday cooking activities in Alzheimer's disease. However, further work is needed before it is ready for clinical application.},
