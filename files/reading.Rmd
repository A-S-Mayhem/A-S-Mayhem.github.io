### **Required Books**

The following books will be used during the course. For all books, a free (open source) online version is available.

#### **Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)**

The first book we are using in this course is [*Introduction to Statistical Learning*](https://www.statlearning.com/), abbreviated as ISLR. The [link](https://www.statlearning.com/) will direct you to the website of the book, where a pdf of the (first edition of the) book is available online for free and can be downloaded. Under ‘resources’, you can also find a link to a free online course on the book which includes a very nice series of (short) lectures!

#### **Data Visualization - A Practical Introduction (DatVis)**

The second book we are using in this course is [*Data Visualization - A Practical Introduction*](https://socviz.co/) by Kieran Healy, which we will abbreviate as DatVis. The link will direct you to a preprint version of the book, which is available online for free. We will start with chapter 1, learning all about the basic principles of data visualization and perception.

#### **Mastering Shiny**

In week 6, we will explore making interactive visualizations using R Shiny apps. For this, we will use the book [*Mastering Shiny*](https://mastering-shiny.org/) by Hadley Wickham. The link provides free access to the book online.

#### **Text Mining with R - A Tidy Approach**

In week 8, we will have a look at some basic text mining, for which we will use the book [*Text Mining with R*](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) by Julia Silge and David Robinson. Nice to know: this entire book and its website were made using R Markdown! We will do text mining in week 8, and cover chapter 1 to 3.

#### **Network Science**

For the lecture on network science in week 9, we will use the following material:

1. [*First Course in Network Science*](https://networksciencebook.com/) (chapter 0) by Filippo Menczer, Santo Fortunato, and Clayton A. Davis.
2. [*Network Science*](http://networksciencebook.com/) by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi - Subchapters 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.8, 9.1, and 9.2.
3. [*Centrality*](https://garcia-centrality.netlify.app/) by David Garcia, 2021.

### **Optional Literature**

#### **R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data**

Another useful resource for this course is the book [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, also abbreviated as R4DS. This entire book and its website were made using R Markdown! Hadley Wickham and R4DS use a specific dialect of R, a set of packages called the tidyverse. Because these packages are very useful and great for data science, we will be using the tidyverse throughout this course.

#### **Practical Data Science with R**

For more guidance on using R, we recommend the book [*Practical Data Science with R*](http://www.ievbras.ru/ecostat/Kiril/R/Biblio_N/R_Eng/Mount2014.pdf) by N. Zumel, J. Mount, and J. Porzak (2014). Manning Publications. No online version is available for this book.
