# Readings

The following required books will be used during the course. For all books, a free (open source) online version is available.

## Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)

The first book we are using in this course is *Introduction to Statistical Learning*, abbreviated as ISLR. The [link](https://www.statlearning.com/) will direct you to the website of the book, where a pdf of the (first edition of the) book is available online for free and can be downloaded. Under ‘resources’, you can also find a link to a free online course on the book which includes a very nice series of (short) lectures!

## Data Visualization - A Practical Introduction (DatVis)

The second book we are using in this course is *Data Visualization - A Practical Introduction* by Kieran Healy, which we will abbreviate as DatVis. The [link](https://socviz.co/) will direct you to a preprint version of the book, which is available online for free. We will start with chapter 1, learning all about the basic principles of data visualization and perception.

## Mastering Shiny

In week 6, we will explore making interactive visualizations using R Shiny apps. For this, we will use the book *Mastering Shiny* by Hadley Wickham. The [link](https://mastering-shiny.org/) provides free access to the book online.

## Text Mining with R - A Tidy Approach

In week 8, we will have a look at some basic text mining, for which we will use the book *Text Mining with R* by Julia Silge and David Robinson. Nice to know: this entire book and its website were made using R Markdown! We will cover chapters 1 to 3. The book is available [here](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).

## Network Science

For the lecture on network science in week 9, we will use the following material:

1. *First Course in Network Science* (chapter 0) by Filippo Menczer, Santo Fortunato, and Clayton A. Davis.  
   Available [here](https://networksciencebook.com/).
2. *Network Science* by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi - Subchapters 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.8, 9.1, and 9.2.  
   Available [here](http://networksciencebook.com/).
3. *Centrality* by David Garcia, 2021.  
   Available [here](https://garcia-centrality.netlify.app/).

## Optional Literature

### R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data

Another useful resource for this course is the book *R for Data Science* by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, also abbreviated as R4DS. This entire book and its website were made using R Markdown! Hadley Wickham and R4DS use a specific dialect of R, a set of packages called the tidyverse. Because these packages are very useful and great for data science, we will be using the tidyverse throughout this course. The book is available [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

### Practical Data Science with R

For more guidance on using R, we recommend the book *Practical Data Science with R* by N. Zumel, J. Mount, and J. Porzak (2014). Manning Publications. No online version is available for this book.
