title: "Computer Vision Project with the MNIST Digits Dataset"
collection: portfolio
---

In this project a support vector classifier (SVC) and a fully connected neural network (MLP) are
applied on the MNIST Digits dataset with the goal of predicting written digits. Each image is
represented by a matrix with elements representing pixels made up of gray scale values. The closer
the value 0 the more white the pixel, the closer to 255 the more black the pixel. This format allows
for a machine learning model to process the image information.
