collection: portfolio
---

This natural language processing projekt looks to determine when a natural disaster is taking place
based on tweets from Twitter. SciKit Learnâ€™s bag of words method is applied coupled with a
logistic regression, the parameters of which are chosen using grid search. Because the sample is
about 60:40 unbalanced, a startified cross validation is used to adjust prediction expectations. This
model serves as a baseline for comparison with more advanced prediction methods.
