With Prof. Nicu Sebe and Prof. Graham Taylor I am organizing a [BMVC workshop on Visual AI and Entrepreneurship](https://dculibrk.github.io/bmvc-vaie/), trying to span the gap
between academia and entrepreneurship communities. If you would like to get involved in the Technical Program Committee and you have the 
appropriate background, please send me an e-mail.
