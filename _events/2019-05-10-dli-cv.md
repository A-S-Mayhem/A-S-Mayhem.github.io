On 21. 06. 2019. I will be teaching a hands-on [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/education/) 
"Fundamentals of Deep Learning with Computer Vision" workshop at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture](https://eng.fesb.unist.hr/)
in Split, Croatia.

This workshop teaches deep learning techniques for a range of computer vision tasks through a series of 
hands-on exercises. You will work with widely-used deep learning tools, frameworks, and workflows to train and deploy neural network 
models on a fully-configured, GPU-accelerated workstation in the cloud. 

After a quick introduction to deep learning, you will advance to: building and deploying deep learning applications for image 
classification and object detection, modifying your neural networks to improve their accuracy and performance, and implementing the 
workflow you have learned on a final project. 

At the end of the workshop, you will have access to additional resources to create new deep learning applications on your own.

The workshop is free for verifiable academic students, staff, and researchers. You will need to register with your institutional e-mail.
