I'll be teaching a shortened version of the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute workshop 
dubbed "Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Computer Vision" at this year's Wonderland AI Summit in Belgrade on November 8th.

You can use the opportunity to get some hands on machine learning experience and an NVIDIA certificate. 

Hope to see you there!
