I'll be teaching a shortened version of the [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/education/) workshop 
dubbed "Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Computer Vision" at this year's Wonderland AI Summit in Belgrade on November 8th.

The workshop teaches deep learning techniques for a range of computer vision tasks through a series of 
hands-on exercises. You will work with widely-used deep learning tools, frameworks, and workflows to train and deploy neural network 
models on a fully-configured, GPU-accelerated workstation in the cloud.

You can use the opportunity to get some hands on machine learning experience and an NVIDIA certificate. 

Hope to see you there!
