Auto-convert Jupyter Notebooks To Posts
fastpages will automatically convert Jupyter Notebooks saved into this directory as blog posts!

You must save your notebook with the naming convention YYYY-MM-DD-*.ipynb. Examples of valid filenames are:

2020-01-28-My-First-Post.ipynb
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.ipynb
If you fail to name your file correctly, fastpages will automatically attempt to fix the problem by prepending the last modified date of your notebook. However, it is recommended that you name your files properly yourself for more transparency.

See Writing Blog Posts With Jupyter for more details.
