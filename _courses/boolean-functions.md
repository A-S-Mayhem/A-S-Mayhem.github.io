Course Description
======

In this lecture, we deal with the theory of Boolean functions.
The focus is on the cryptographically relevant criteria for Boolean functions such as non-linearity and differential uniformity.

Contents
======

1. Introduction
2. Preliminaries
3. Representations of Boolean Functions
4. Linear Approximation of Boolean Functions and the Fourier Transformation
5. Functions with Low Linearity
6. Vectorial Boolean Functions
7. Differential Uniformity of Boolean Functions
