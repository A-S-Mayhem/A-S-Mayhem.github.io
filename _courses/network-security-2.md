Course Description
======

When cryptography is used in a technical environment such as a computer, data or telephone network, security depends not only on purely cryptographic factors but also on the technical embedding of the encryption and signature algorithms.
Prominent examples (of faulty embedding) are EFAIL (efail.de), attacks on the WLAN encryption systems WEP and WPA (KRACK) and various attacks on TLS (Bleichenbacher, POODLE, DROWN, ROBOT).
The module deals with concrete networks for data transmission and examines them from all sides with regard to their security.

* HTTP security (HTTP Authentication, Secure HTTP, architecture of SSL/TLS)
* Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.2, versions SSL 2.0 to TLS 1.3)
* Attacks on SSL and TLS (BEAST, CRIME, POODLE, Lucky13, Bleichenbacher, DROWN, Heartbleed, Invalid Curve)
* Secure Shell - SSH
* Domain Name System and DNSSEC (factorizable keys)
* Web application security (HTML, URI, XSS, CSRF, SQLi, SSO)
* XML and JSON security
