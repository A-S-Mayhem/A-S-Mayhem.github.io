Course Description
======

Discrete Mathematics deals with finite structures.
The lecture is divided into 5 sections.
Section 1 is dedicated to combinatorics.
In particular, basic techniques are taught to solve so-called counting problems.
In section 2 we deal with graph theory.
Graphs are used to model application problems.
We cover techniques for graph exploration and other selected graph problems.
Section 3 provides basic knowledge of elementary number theory and ends with an outlook on cryptographic applications.
Basic design techniques for efficient algorithms form the central topic of section 4.
In addition, it also deals with setting up and solving recursion equations.
Section 5 covers basic algebraic structures with applications to symmetric counting problems and error-correcting codes.
