Course Description
======

Complexity theory examines and classifies computational problems in terms of their algorithmic difficulty.
The goal is to determine the inherent resource consumption with respect to different resources such as computing time or space, and to group problems with similar resource consumption into complexity classes.
The best known complexity classes are certainly P and NP, which comprise the problems that can be solved and verified in polynomial time, respectively.
The question of whether P and NP are distinct is considered to be one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science, even in mathematics.
However, P and NP are only two examples of complexity classes.
Other classes arise, among others, in the investigatino of the required memory space, the efficient parallelizability of problems, the solvability by random algorithms, and the approximate solvability of problems.
The lecture aims to give a broad overview of the basic concepts and results of complexity theory:

* Classical results for space and time complexity classes: e.g. the correspondence between games and memory constraints, the proof that with more space or time one can also solve more problems, other fundamental relationships between time and space-based classes, and the complexity world between NP and PSPACE
* Basic complexity theory of parallel, random, and approximate algorithms
* Introduction to selected recent topics: Complexity theory of interactive computing, of probabilistic reasoning, and fine-grained complexity
