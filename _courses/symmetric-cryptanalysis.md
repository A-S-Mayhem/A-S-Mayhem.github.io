Course Description
======

We cover the most important topics in symmetric cryptanalysis.
After a detailed introduction to linear and differential cryptanalysis, further attacks on symmetric primitives, especially block ciphers are discussed.
These include in particular Integral (also Square) attacks, Impossible Differentials, Boomerang attacks and slide attacks.
In addition to the attacks themselves, the resulting design criteria are always desrived in order to make new algorithms secure against the attacks.
