Course Description
======

The central theme of the course is learning programming and the most important programming concepts, as well as the first basic concepts of computer science:

* Imperative programming (variables, control structures, functions and recursion, error handling, event handling)
* Simple data structures (array and dictionary, AVL tree, hash table)
* Object orientation (classes, visibility, interfaces, inheritance)
* Introduction to a number of computer science concepts (invariants, run-time analysis, sorting algorithms, representation of data in computers, Boolean algebra)

* The course uses the programming language TScript for an easy and motivating introduction to programming.
* Towards the end of the lecture there will be a switch to the programming language Python.
