Course Description
======

The lecture will give a systematic introduction to the theory of groups, rings, and fields and present some of the classical applications of this theory.
Specifically, the following topics will be covered:

* Group theory: isomorphism theorems, permutation groups, group actions, resolvable and simple groups, Sylow theorms
* Ring theory: integrity rings, prinicpal ideal domains, prime factorization in rings and polynomial rings, module theory
* Field theory: minimal polynomial, algebraic extensions, separable and normal field extensions, Galois groups, and main theorem of Galois theory


In addition, some classical applications of Galois theory are discussed.
