Course Description
======

Due to their complexity, cryptographic systems place high demands on small processors and embedded systems in particular.
In combination with the demand for high data throughput at the lowest hardware costs, fundamental problems arise here for the developer, which are to be illuminated in this lecture.
The lecture deals with the most interesting aspects of how to implement current cryptographic methods on practical hardware systems.
Cryptosystems such as the block cipher AES, the hash functions SHA-1 as well as asymmetric systems RSA and ECC are dealt with.
Furthermore, special hardware requirements such as the generation of true randomness (TRNG) and the use of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) are discussed.
The efficient implementation of these cryptosystems, especially with regard to optimization for high speed, is discussed on modern FPGAs and implemented in practical exercises using the hardware description language VHDL.
