Course Description
======

The module provides a general introduction to how modern cryptography and data security work.
Basic terms and mathematical/technical procedures of cryptography and data security are explained.
Practically relevant asymmetric procedures and algorithms will be presented and explained using practical examples.
The lecture will be divided into two parts:

The first part starts with an introduction to asymmetric methods and their main proxies (Diffie-Hellman, elliptic curves).
The focus is on the algorithmix introduction of asymmetric schemes, which include both encryption algorithms and digital signatures.
This part is concluded by hash functions, which play a major role for digital signatures and message authentication codes (MACs or cryptographic checksums).
In the second part of the lecture, basics of security solutions based on the concepts of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography are discussed.
In particular, the solutions required and used in companies (PKI, digital certificates, etc.) will be discussed.
