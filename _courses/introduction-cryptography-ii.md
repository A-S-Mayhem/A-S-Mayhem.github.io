Learning outcomes
=====

After completing the module, students will know the basic applications of asymmetric and hybrid methods. 
They will be able to decide under which conditions certain methods are used in practice and how the security parameters should be selected. 
They are familiar with the basics of abstract thinking in IT security technology. 
On the other hand, the students are familiar with the basics of abstract thinking in IT security technology through descriptions of selected practice-relevant algorithms, such as Diffie-Hellmann key exchange or ECC-based procedures, students gain an algorithmic and technical understanding of the practical application. 
Students are given an overview of the solutions used in companies.
They can defend a particular solution with arguments. 
The lectures are also offered as videos in German and English. 
Students can therefore acquire language skills in English, the language of science, through the bilingual eLearning offer.


Course Description
======

The module provides a general introduction to how modern cryptography and data security work.
Basic terms and mathematical/technical procedures of cryptography and data security are explained.
Practically relevant asymmetric procedures and algorithms will be presented and explained using practical examples.
The lecture will be divided into two parts:

The first part starts with an introduction to asymmetric methods and their main proxies (Diffie-Hellman, elliptic curves).
The focus is on the algorithmix introduction of asymmetric schemes, which include both encryption algorithms and digital signatures.
This part is concluded by hash functions, which play a major role for digital signatures and message authentication codes (MACs or cryptographic checksums).
In the second part of the lecture, basics of security solutions based on the concepts of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography are discussed.
In particular, the solutions required and used in companies (PKI, digital certificates, etc.) will be discussed.
