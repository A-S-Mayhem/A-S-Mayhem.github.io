Course Description
======

The module provides an introduction to the basic protocols and applications of computer networks.
The focus of the lecture is on standard protocols and algorithms as used in modern computer networks (for example the Internet).
Using a layer model, the most important fundamentals are presented and analyzed according to the top-down approach.
This includes, for example, on the top layer DNS and HTTPS in the application layer, TCP and UDP in the transport layer, IPv4/IPv6 and routing algorithms in the network layer, and MAC and ARP in the lowest link layer.
In addition to the pure functionality of these standards, security aspects are considered at all layers.
Different network-related computer analysis tools are presented and discussed on a weekly basis.
