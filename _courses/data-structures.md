Course Description
======

After a discussion of basic data types (such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees), we first discuss data structures that are suitable for representing sets and thereby support certain set operations (such as dictionaries, priority queues, and UNION-FIND data structure).
Furthermore, we go into representations of graphs, cover various graph algorithms (such as depth and breadth-first search, shortest paths, transitive hull, strong components, and minimal spanning tree), and various sorting methods (mergesort, heapsort, quicksort, bucketsort, radixsort).
