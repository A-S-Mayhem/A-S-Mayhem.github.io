Course Description
======

Zero-Knowledge protocols are important building blocks for more complex cryptographic protocols.
This class covers foundational aspects of zero-knowledge proofs inluding:

* Lower bounds and round complexity
* Necessary assumptions
* Communication complexity
* Zero-Knowledge in a quantum world
* Theoretical and practical constructions
* Security Proofs
