The course Computer Architecture deals with the structure and functino of modern processors and computer systems.
Starting from basic computer structures such as the Von Neumann and Harvard architecture, the structure, classification and technical realization of computer systems are presented.
The programming on assembly level as well as the processing of programs by a processor are explained.
The main focus of the lecture is the in-depth analysis of the microarchitecture level of a processor.
Modern methods for performance enhancement and their application areas are also presented.
In addition to the processor itself, the memory system of modern computers and various interfaces to internal and external components of the computer system will be covered.
All topics are explained with actual examples from different areas of technology.
