Course Description
======

After a short introduction to computation with quantum bits the lecture deals with the question of how the required circuits have to be designed so that they can be executed as efficiently as possible on real quantum computers.
Since quantum circuits have little in common with conventional circuits other than the name, there are also quite different challenges and problems to be solved, some of which are more similar to those of software compilers.
In particualr understanding of quantum mechanics is necessary to understand the contents of the course.

Topics covered include:

* Synthesis of reversible Boolean functions
* Embedding of non-reversible Boolean functions
* decomposition of complex quantum gates into elementary quantum gates
* efficient function representation of quantum circuits
* simulation of quantum circuits on classical computers
* transformation of quantum circuits for NISQ quantum computers

All topics and procedures will be demonstrated using appropriate software tools (e.g. cirkit, QisKit) and, as far as possible, on publicly available quantum computers (e.g. IBM Q Experience) in practice.
