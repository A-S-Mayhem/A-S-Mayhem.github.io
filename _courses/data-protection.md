Course Description
======

Data protection deals with the question of how to protect citizens, employees, customers, patients, etc. from negative effects caused by the processing of personal data.
Computer scientists are required to design computer systems in such a way that they support the implementation of data protection principles.
The lecture therefore deals with the principles of data protection law and the practical implications for computer scientists.
Particular emphasis is placed on making these central principles understandable.
In addition the the basic data protection regulation, special regulations will also be dealt with, e.g. for the regulation of telecommunications, or for the use of electronic data processing in the working world.
The GDPR has become an accepted standard even beyond the European area.
Different legal philosophical considerations are addressed in order to convey where international views and issues diverge.
Overall, the topic will be approached constructively. The topic of privacy by design will be considered at all levels.
The learning objective of the lecture is to enable students in the future to recognize at which points in their professional activities privacy is relevant, and how to proceed in order to obtain appropriate information or expertise.
The knowledge to be imparted should be so fundamental that one can also adapt to new developments (such as amendments and additions to the Federal Data Protection Act).
