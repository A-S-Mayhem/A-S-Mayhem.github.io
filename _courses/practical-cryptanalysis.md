Course Description
======

In this practical course wo look at practically relevant, but weak, symmetric ciphers.
In particular, we look at the security of mobile phones, digital door locks and high-frequency radio communication.
All of the ciphers used here can be broken in practical time.
With these examples, we learn important cryptographic attack methods and how to implement them in Python and using the maths algebra tool SageMath.
The examples are designed in the form of projects that students have to solve independently.

Learning objectives: Using practical examples, students learn about attacks on symmetric ciphers and how to solve them in Python and using the maths algebra tool SageMath.

After successful completion of the module students
* know examples of important cryptanalytic techniques for symmetric cryptography
* know how to use the maths algebra tool SageMath
* are able to estimate and improve the running times of their solution
* will be able to give a short presentation on technical solutions and problems, focusing on the essential components.
* are able to implement small projects in a team
