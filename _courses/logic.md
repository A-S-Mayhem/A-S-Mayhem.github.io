Course Description
======

Logical methods play an important role in many moden applicatinons of computer science.
Relevant information is extracted from databases using logic-based query languages;
formal verification of software and hardware is based on logical specification languages and algorithms for them;
and methods for automated reasoning in artificial intelligence have their basis in formal logic.
This course covers the formal foundations of modern logics, with a focus on their application in computer science.
In addition to classical propositional logic and predicate logic, we also consider moral logic.
For each of these logics, we formalize syntax and semantics, learn how to model computer science scenarios in them, and consider algorithms and calculi for unsatisfiability and inference relation.
