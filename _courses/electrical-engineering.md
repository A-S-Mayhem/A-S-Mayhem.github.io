Course Description
======

The course provides a general introduction to the fundamentals of electrical networks. 
Basic terms and procedures are explained.
The lecture can be divided into five parts:

Linear DC Circuits:
* Counting arrows
* current and voltage sources
* Kirckhoff's equation
* simple resistor networks (voltage divider, current divider);
* real current and voltage sources
* source-consumer interactions (interconnection of voltage sources, power matching, efficiency)
* superposition principle
* analysis of extensive networks

Transition to time-dependent current and voltage forms:
* Overview as well as introduction of various characteristics (average value, rectified value, rms value, maximum value, peak value, peak-to-peak value, oscillation width)

AC current and voltage:
* the pointer diagram
* complex AC current calculus
* description of concentrated RLC devices and ideal sources
* introduction to locus curves
* calculation of simple AC circuits via the complex plane
* energy and power in AC voltage
* power matching

Analysis of networks:
* Mesh current method
* nodal potential method

Introduction to two-ports:
* gate condition
* two-port equations in matrix form (impedance, admittance, hybrid, chain form)
* two-port properties (reciprocity, symmetry)
* matrices of elementary two-ports
