I am a Ph.D. student at Northeastern University, supervised by [Prof. Lili Su](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wSHziZ4AAAAJ). I obtained my B.S. degree and M.S. degrees from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Jacob Whitehill](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PGyMqU0AAAAJ).

My research interests are in machine learning, federated learning, and computer vision.
