## Background
- “So only business, in the end, benefits from advances in technology.”
Comes across a bit disingenuous and thus easy to disagree with when
one has the means of distribution via a blog. No more getting into
newspapers/seeking permission or finding money to pay people to give out pamphlets and
flyers outside shops. Permissionless and location-free distribution.
So while greed is true for much of that said so far, it is too simplified.
In fact, one side is greedy but there is another side that isn’t, which
then is a predator-prey model.
Something worth pondering is if there is greed and that leads to action,
then maybe there is also sloth/laziness leading to inaction. And then
there are qualities too such as being content/virtuous/upset or you
wouldn’t have monks/teachers and doctors/protesters.
I’m just thinking out loud to say there is not one answer
because clearly there is a polarization so there must be at least
one other side to it.

- If everyone was greedy then there is a collapse as everyone is eating/collecting
but there is nothing to feed upon.

- “The creative individual is the foundation of a prospering society.”
But one can say the foundation is not the engine.
“A creative group is the engine towards a prospering society. “

On the whole, I like the writing style and the emotion. As someone who
has often (or almost always) criticised metrics, I see your angst.
However, if you’re so against measuring time, then maybe don’t count
the number of hours of your fast 😊

Measuring words and time (in my blog and others) isn’t about the
pessimistic take that you put forward. Tho one can take it that way.

It can also be a measure (not a metric) of one’s own progress- do I
read as fast with a time but also retain what I read about. That was my
decision. It’s not like everyone has a constant reading speed.

Similarly, the comment feature- it’s an opportunity not to engage with me,
but with oneself. I could go on but on the whole, I think we could with a
lot less pessimism. And replace it with a lot more engagement to build
alternative structures, alongside pontificating about them.
