Most of the empirical work in the lab has been on Syngnathids, the fish family comprised of seahorses, pipefishes, and seadragons. These fish are particularly interesting from a sexual selection point of view because they exhibit male pregnancy, in which the males care for the developing embryos. In many species, the females also have elaborate display traits to attract the males, and research in the lab works towards understanding how sexual selection shapes those traits.


Sarah did her PhD work on the Gulf pipefish, <i>Syngnathus scovelli</i> (pictured below), which is found in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of Florida. That work focused on understanding what evolutionary forces drive population differentiation and how selection impacts the genome.

The Flanagan lab is now focusing on native and endemic species in New Zealand. The lab is continuing to ask questions about the forces shaping differentiation and the role of sexual selection in the evolution of these charismatic fish.
