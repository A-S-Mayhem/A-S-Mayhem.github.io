A global survey conducted by BBC (2005) has reported spatial abilities in 53 nations. To have a direct visualization of global mental rotation ability and line angle judgement ability, and the corresponding sex differences in each spatial ability, I projected survey data on mercator maps using GIS (Thanks for the support of Prof. Richard A. Lippa), shown below:
