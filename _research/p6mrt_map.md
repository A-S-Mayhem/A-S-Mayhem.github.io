Sex differences have been prevalently reported in human navigation. One explanation is that males and females use different navigation strategies: males tend to use more allocentric strategies that utilizes cognitive maps in mind, while females tend to use more egocentric strategies such as taking turn-by-turn directions.

Looking at navigation paths from approximately 1.2 million usersâ€™ data allows us to have a bigger picture of how sex differences play a role in travel trajectories. We implement deep neural networks to conduct pattern categorization of different paths.
