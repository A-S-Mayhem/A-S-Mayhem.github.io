Broad: what can cause pops to get smaller? eco-evo interactions: 
genetic drift, 
community ecology (food disappears), 
phylogenetic constraints + slow mutation rate, 
selection
co-evolution (Phythopthora)

Use genetic tools to understand drivers of population decline.
- eDNA to ID prey
- genotyping individuals for inbreeding and Ne estimation
- Nanopore MinION long-read sequencing of genomes and gene sequences 
- comparative genomics to characterize evolution of key gene sequences involved in evolutionary arms races

Study species of interest!!
- penguins
- phythopthora
- pipefish
