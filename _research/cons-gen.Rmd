title: "How is population decline influenced by evolutionary mechanisms?"
excerpt: " The Flanagan Lab utilizes population genetics tools to improve our understanding of the genetic dynamics and factors that contribute to declining populations. The field of conservation genetics looks at the application of genetic/genomic data to inform and improve conservation efforts and the restoration of populations. Our lab is using a variety of molecular tools to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms impacting New Zealand populations of kororƒÅ, pipefish and vegetation impacted by dieback "

Broad: what can cause pops to get smaller? eco-evo interactions: 
genetic drift, 
community ecology (food disappears), 
phylogenetic constraints + slow mutation rate, 
selection
co-evolution (Phythopthora)

Use genetic tools to understand drivers of population decline.
- eDNA to ID prey
- genotyping individuals for inbreeding and Ne estimation
- Nanopore MinION long-read sequencing of genomes and gene sequences 
- comparative genomics to characterize evolution of key gene sequences involved in evolutionary arms races

Study species of interest!!
- penguins
- phythopthora
- pipefish
