title: "How does genetic architecture impact evolution of sexually selected traits?"

excerpt: 'Selection can drive genetic differentiation between populations of a single species in coding and non-coding regions, and many questions remain regarding the relative importance of selection and stochastic processes in causing differentiation, how genetic variation is maintained, and how the genetic architecture of traits impacts genetic divergence. The lab uses individual-based simulations to address these complex evolutionary questions.'

Selection can drive genetic differentiation between populations of a single species in coding and non-coding regions, and many questions remain regarding the relative importance of selection and stochastic processes in causing differentiation, how genetic variation is maintained, and how the genetic architecture of traits impacts genetic divergence. Additionally, many population genomic and genome-wide association analyses lack models suitable for the inter-correlated nature of genomics datasets and thus overlook potentially informative aspects of the data, obscuring the genotype-phenotype relationship. 

The current models developed by the Flanagan lab are individual-based simulation models (written in C++) that tackle questions about how specific aspects of the genetic architecture that are relevant in the modern sequencing era (e.g., physical linkage, gene expression dynamics) influence evolutionary processes, the maintenance of variation, and the evolution of complex traits.
