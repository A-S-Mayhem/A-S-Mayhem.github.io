Since 2015, I've been working on analyses attempting to pin down the shape of the Higgs potential through the measurement of the Higgs self-coupling. 
At the LHC, we can do that directly through the detailed observation of events containing a pair of Higgs bosons. 
Unfortunately, these events are very rare, so we haven't been able to make that observation yet. 
With that in mind, I've been exploring several Machine Learning tools to make our analyses more powerful and to ensure that we observe this process soon.
