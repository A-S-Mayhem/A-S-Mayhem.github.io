Introduction
------
Hi there! I'm Steven Ngo, software engineering undergrad senior with a minor in psychology at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (CPSLO). 
As of fall quarter '22, I am a teaching assistant for CSC321 (Intro to Computer Security) and a research assistant for Dr. Ayaan Kazerouni. 
With Dr. Kazerouni, we are working on a method of providing targeted mutation testing recommendations of which mutators should be focused 
on when test case suites have met particular coverage metrics. I am also continuing my research with Dr. Dave DeAngelis and Dr. Luis Garcia 
at USC Info Sciences Institute (USC ISI), where we are working on modeling human operators' decision-making in safety-critical industrial control systems.
