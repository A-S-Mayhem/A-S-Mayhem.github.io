In some recent work, we used Raphtory for studying the evolution of a fairly new social network Gab used largely by the alt-right. This blog will discuss our findings with a focus on how Raphtory was used; for a deeper delve into some of the network science take a look at our paper "Moving with the times: Investigating the alt right network Gab using temporal interaction graphs"
