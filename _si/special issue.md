Time is a fundamental concept in communication research, influencing the way we perceive, analyze, and understand key questions in the field at all analytic levels. Although sporadic studies have touched upon the theoretical importance and methodological significance of comprehending time and its associated concepts in communication research (e.g., Cartier & Harwood, 1958; Berlo, 1977; Chaffee, 1991; Wang, 2014), the notion of time has largely remained underexplored in communication. The treatment of time has often been characterized by two illusions: the mysterious or elusive nature of time (Ancona et al., 2001) and its passive role as a primitive term (Chaffee, 1991). These illusions have limited our ability to fully grasp the dynamic and intricate relationship and mechanisms of interacting communication processes. The proposed special issue (SI) aims to move beyond these illusions by bringing time from the backend to the frontend of communication research.
