This is the last two weeks of my GSoC journey.

GSoC project
=================
*  [GSoC project URL](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/HKW6ydaI)
*  [Work Repository](https://github.com/users/cannin/projects/5)
Mentor: **Augustin Luna** and **Bo Yuan**

Tasks
=================
1. Make a final polish to the code ([branch](https://github.com/Mustardburger/CellBox/tree/clean-code)):
    * Refactor some code in `train_torch.py` to make it more readable. 
    * Remove unused commented-out blocks of code. 
    * Add documentation for many functions.
2. Finalize all unit tests for the dataloader, ODE solver, util functions (loss functions), and training loop with pytest ([branch](https://github.com/Mustardburger/CellBox/tree/clean-code)).
3. Make a final polish to the README.md ([branch](https://github.com/Mustardburger/CellBox/tree/final)).
4. Add a [`Quick Start Colab notebook`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BadFag4PnxyLFaeu9QZuvQGvYHBfYgEt?usp=sharing) on how to set up CellBox Pytorch and run a simple job.
5. Configure Github Actions to run on all unit tests when pushing to the [branch](https://github.com/Mustardburger/CellBox/tree/clean-code).
6. Write a final report for wrapping up GSoC.

Relevant issues:
================
* [clean-code branch](https://github.com/Mustardburger/CellBox/tree/clean-code)
* [final branch](https://github.com/Mustardburger/CellBox/tree/final)

Notes
=================
Check out my [personal GSoC notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYkUNYuRcPHByWUYay6yUeTKtBuiwTGKJoztT0LajiA/edit?usp=sharing), where I keep my observations and comments in one place.
