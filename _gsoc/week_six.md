This is the sixth week of my GSoC journey.

GSoC project
=================
*  [GSoC project URL](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/HKW6ydaI)
*  [Work Repository](https://github.com/users/cannin/projects/5)
Mentor: **Augustin Luna** and **Bo Yuan**

Tasks
=================
1. Rewrite whole CellBox multi-stage training schedule in Pytorch, including feedforward and backprop, record of training loss and output of model's prediction. The current Pytorch implementation yields very different numerical loss values and predictions compared to Tensorflow.
2. Update the documentation per Augustin's and Bo's request.
3. Write unit tests for separate functions. 

Relevant issues:
================
* change-util-functions-and-models ([branch](https://github.com/Mustardburger/CellBox/tree/change-util-functions-and-models))

Notes
=================
Check out my [personal GSoC notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYkUNYuRcPHByWUYay6yUeTKtBuiwTGKJoztT0LajiA/edit?usp=sharing), where I keep my observations and comments in one place.
