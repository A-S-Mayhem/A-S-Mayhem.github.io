This is the fifth week of my GSoC journey.

GSoC project
=================
*  [GSoC project URL](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/HKW6ydaI)
*  [Work Repository](https://github.com/Mustardburger/CellBox)

Tasks
=================
1. Create two new branches on the main repo: the 51-update-cellbox-readme and the test-github-actions. 
    * For the former, update the installing steps for CellBox and update some details about the code and data files in README.md. 
    * For the latter, get Github Actions to work, including updaing pytest.yml and setup.py to remove a bug.
2. Implement ODE and kernel functions in Pytorch and write simple tests to ensure their correct behaviour.
3. Continue updating part of the training loop.

Relevant issues:
================
* 51-update-cellbox-readme ([branch](https://github.com/sanderlab/CellBox/tree/51-update-cellbox-readme))
* test-github-actions ([branch](https://github.com/sanderlab/CellBox/tree/test-github-actions))

Notes
=================
Check out my [personal GSoC notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYkUNYuRcPHByWUYay6yUeTKtBuiwTGKJoztT0LajiA/edit?usp=sharing), where I keep my observations and comments in one place.
