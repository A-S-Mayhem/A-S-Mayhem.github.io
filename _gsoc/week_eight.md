This is the eighth week of my GSoC journey.

GSoC project
=================
*  [GSoC project URL](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/HKW6ydaI)
*  [Work Repository](https://github.com/Mustardburger/CellBox)

Tasks
=================
1. Create 3 issues:
    * Numerical instability between Tensorflow and Pytorch ([#56](https://github.com/sanderlab/CellBox/issues/56))
    * Questions about train.py ([#54](https://github.com/sanderlab/CellBox/issues/54))
    * Best practices for using CellBox on different datasets ([#55](https://github.com/sanderlab/CellBox/issues/55))
2. Train CellBox Pytorch for 500 seeds using ([`Example.random_parition.json`](https://github.com/sanderlab/CellBox/blob/master/configs/Example.random_partition.json)) and replicate Figure 2C of the paper.
3. Continue to discuss potential reasons for ODE solver discrepancy between Tensorflow and Pytorch. Plan on submitting ([this](https://github.com/sanderlab/CellBox/issues/56)) issue to Pytorch.

Relevant issues:
================
* Numerical instability between Tensorflow and Pytorch ([#56](https://github.com/sanderlab/CellBox/issues/56))
* Questions about train.py ([#54](https://github.com/sanderlab/CellBox/issues/54))
* Best practices for using CellBox on different datasets ([#55](https://github.com/sanderlab/CellBox/issues/55))

Notes
=================
Check out my [personal GSoC notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYkUNYuRcPHByWUYay6yUeTKtBuiwTGKJoztT0LajiA/edit?usp=sharing), where I keep my observations and comments in one place.
