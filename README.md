Dr. Zhibin Lei is a geodynamicist who use numerical and analytical methods to understand the interaction between different spheres of the solid Earth, and its impact in reforming the tectonic frameworks & inducing variable deformation patterns observed at the Earth's surface.

The numerical models frequently utilise High-Performance Computing ([HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing)) or [super-computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer). These models have been run to investigate the role subduction plays in inducing progressive weakening within the overrding plate. Details can be found in the [PhD thesis](https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/152759/1/2022leizphd.pdf).
