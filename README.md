My name's Jake, and I'm an aspiring economist hoping to specialize in health/public economics. I'm currently an economics PhD student at Northwestern University. I mainly use this site as a sounding board for my half baked ideas, stored under blog posts. **To be clear, all work shared here is preliminary and personal unless otherwise noted** (don't blame my school for any of my shoddy work). Critiques are welcome at [jaketg97@gmail.com](mailto:jaketg97@gmail.com).
