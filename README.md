I am working concurrently on a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Physics at the University of British
Columbia (UBC) as I work full-time as a Computational and Statistical Biologist in the lab of intensive-
care unit physician and scientist Dr. Keith Walley at UBC through the international research centre,
the Centre for Heart Lung Innovation (HLI) at St. Paul’s Hospital (SPH).

Inspired by the notion that the immense complexity of living systems can only be fully understood with
rigorous statistical and computational procedure employed regularly in physics and astronomy: causal,
generalized linear, Bayesian, mixture, gradient boosted tree, and others. Focus on deeply integrating a
vast array of large datasets representing many different kinds of data: clinical and laboratory, genetic,
neuroimaging, chest imaging, waveforms, gene expression and protein levels, phenotypes, drugs, and
others. Integration of disparate and related data sources vastly increases our ability to find druggable
targets. Expertise in statistics, experimental design, large-scale data integration, and the biology of
lipids and infectious disease. Development of novel statistical methods for use on observational data.
