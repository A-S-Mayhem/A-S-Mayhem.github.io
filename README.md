Hi,

This is a small personal website I have created, to summarize my research interests, teaching and social life.

I have forked the github page template from https://academicpages.github.io/ and modified it. Please provide suggestions if any at  karthik.srinivasan@live.com.   

goDaddy was used to get the domain name and linked to github.io using guidelines in the below blog:
