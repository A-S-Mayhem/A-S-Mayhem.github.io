I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/sphhs/biostatistics). Prior joining the department, I was a postdoctoral fellow supervised by Professor Kosuke Imai, in the Department of Statistics and Department of Government at Harvard University, and in the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning and Department of Politics at Princeton University. I obtained my PhD degree at Peking University, under the supervision of Professor Zhi Geng. Here is my [CV](http://zhichaoj-git.github.io/files/CV_ZhichaoJiang.pdf).
