**Title:** ["*Politicizing Trade: How Economic Discontent and Identity Politics Shape Anti-Trade Campaign Appeals.*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Acyan_Katitas_26OCT2021.pdf)

**Abstract:**
An unexpected rise in protectionist sentiments in advanced economies is threatening the future of the liberal international order. Yet, the role of political elites in framing free trade's distributional consequences and thus cueing this backlash is not fully understood. Current research debates the importance of material or socio-cultural factors in determining protectionist attitudes but fails to address how politicians shape the information environment which voters rely on to form economic preferences. My paper demonstrates that politicians manipulate trade issues as an electoral strategy. Using data on televised political advertising, I examine what factors drive anti-trade elite priming. I find politicians choose to run anti-trade ads in regions that suffer from long-term manufacturing decline. Politicians also consider the racial composition of their constituencies to increase message receptivity. The effect of sustained de-industrialization on anti-trade ads is higher in regions with higher shares of white voters who identify as losers of globalization. My findings reveal how opportunistic politicians manufacture pockets of resistance to globalization for their political incentives.
