**Title:** "*The Power of International Bureaucrats: Individual-level Evidence from IMF Mission Chiefs.*"

**Abstract:**
Do international bureaucrats shape global governance? The literature on international organizations (IOs) considers international bureaucracies as homogenous actors that influence policy output when political actors do not dominate IO decision-making. In this paper, we build on the view that international bureaucracies matter for global policy-making but call the homogeneity assumption into question. In particular, we argue that bureaucrats have diverging preferences and exert heterogeneous influence on policy output, thereby affecting IO decision-making. We examine this argument in the context of the IMF, where each member country is assigned a specific staff member with primary responsibility for the organization’s activities vis-à-vis the country. These “mission chiefs” also negotiate the terms of IMF programs with country authorities. We test whether IMF mission chiefs are able to use their influence to design IMF conditionality according to their own preferences. Our empirical analysis is based on newly collected data on 835 IMF mission chiefs. The data include individual-level information and follow the careers of mission chiefs inside the IMF over time. Our identification strategy follows the judge fixed effect approach and exploits the repeated appointment of IMF mission chiefs to various countries. For each mission chief, we estimate her individual propensity to apply certain conditions using a “jackknife” approach based on previous and future appointments. Our results suggest that IMF staff exert substantial impact on IMF policies. Preferences of mission chiefs not only explain differences in the stringency of conditions but also relate to differences in the policy focus of conditionality in areas like labour market regulation and social policy.
