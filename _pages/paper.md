**Title:** ["*Institutional Eclipse: How Chinese Loans Substitute for IMF Assistance.*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/James_Sundquist_11OCT2021.pdf)

**Abstract:**
How does a rising power exert influence over an existing international organization? Previous research on this question has concluded that many international organizations (IOs) are remarkably stable in the face of a shifting balance of power: rival states still have a shared interest in global public goods, and network effects insulate existing IOs from potential challengers. However, a wide range of outcomes exists between perfect continuity and total collapse. I argue that rising states that possess economic power but little institutional power will unilaterally compete with an IO when it suits their interests, shrinking the scope of the institution’s influence. In other words, contentious great-power politics are not fatal to IOs, but can weaken them. I apply this reasoning to the case of the IMF, which existing theory predicts should change little in response to China’s growing economic might. Using a novel identification strategy, I find that China’s loans to developing countries have helped borrowers negotiate more favorable agreements with the IMF, or even evade IMF programs altogether. The results shed light on the classic question of how international order responds to shifts in the balance of power: unable to alter existing regimes, rising powers instead roll back their edges in ways that suit their interests.
