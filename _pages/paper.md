**Title:** ["*Does Data Follow the Flag?*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Does data follow the flag? Many authors have argued international conflict, military treaties, and trade agreements impact commerce and trade flows. The internet enables over 15% of global GDP, yet we know little about whether or why international politics impact transnational data flows. This paper analyzes monthly-level changes in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) from
2008-2019. This protocol determines how data is routed through the internet and across borders between over 70,000 internet operators, influencing the speed, price, and reliability of data transfer both across and within national boundaries. I demonstrate that while trade agreements generally do not affect cross-border internet interconnection, agreements preventing data localization, one of the key international data issues, increase customer-to-provider data inter-connection. While the relationship between international conflict and data flows is inconclusive, new military treaties are positively associated with data flows. Despite the prevailing understanding of the internet as “un-territorial” and resistant to border effects and regulation, the internet’s structure does follow the flag.
