**Title:** ["*Right-Wing Populism and the Rise of Internationalism in Europe.*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Nina_Obermeier_18OCT2021.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Populist radical right (PRR) parties have become increasingly electorally successful in Europe over the past decade. These parties frequently campaign on platforms that emphasize their opposition to international economic integration (free trade, European integration, and immigration). At the same time, however, public opinion surveys suggest that Europeans are becoming more supportive of international economic integration. How can we explain these diverging trends? I argue that the growing popularity of PRR parties produces an increase in support for international economic integration in Western Europe. As PRR parties and their anti-internationalism become more prominent in public discourse, so do their extremist tendencies. Anti-internationalism therefore becomes linked to right-wing extremism in public discourse, leading individuals who reject this extremism to shift their attitudes in favor of international economic integration. To test this argument, I create an original measure of the link between Euroskepticism and right-wing extremism in media discourse for eight Western European countries, using supervised machine learning. I combine this measure with survey data to show that the more Euroskepticism is linked to extremism, the higher support for European integration is. I complement this analysis with an unexpected event during survey design that allows me to causally identify the effect of a closer link between anti-internationalism and right-wing extremism on public opinion. My findings suggest that, under the right political circumstances, the electoral backlash against globalization can be counter-balanced by rising internationalism.
