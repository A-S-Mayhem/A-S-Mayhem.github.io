**Title:** ["*How Does Culture Shape Financial Policies? A Macro-Level Analysis Using Instrumental Variables.*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Gal_Bitton_06DEC2021.pdf)

**Abstract:**
How does culture affect countries’ decisions to liberalize their financial sector? Although culture is receiving increasing attention from political-economists, it is still largely absent in the financial liberalization literature. This study seeks to fill this gap by providing a novel theory of the cultural factors that shape policies of financial openness. I argue that cultural distance between countries and cultural homogeneity within countries can explain policymakers’ decisions regarding financial liberalization. Methodologically, this study offers innovative identification strategies for estimating the causal effect using genetic and pathogen factors as instrumental variables. Using dyadic and monadic panel data of 181 countries from 1970 to 2018, the analysis shows that culturally homogeneous countries tend to impose more capital controls and that culturally distant countries are less likely to integrate financially with each other. These findings have implications for the debate over the heterogeneous pattern of financial reforms across countries and regions, which became the focus of attention of scholars after the negative effect of the 2008 global financial crisis and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this study helps in understanding the obstacles facing the internationalization of the Chinese currency. Since financial liberalization is essential to currency internationalization, culture provides an adequate explanation for the ongoing Chinese reluctance to free its capital account.
