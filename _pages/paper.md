**Title:** ["*The PIIGS Acronym as Heuristic Device during the European Sovereign Bond Crisis*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
How do financial investors use heuristic categories in their investment decisions? This article analyzes the consequences of the narratively constructed categorization of Southern European economies into the PIIGS group (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain). Building on the extant literature, I suggest and test the hypothesis that investors use categories as a heuristic shorthand which, in turn, may result in a self-fulfilling prophecy. While acronyms and categories can provide useful devices to capture similarities, they can also be misleading insofar as they obscure otherwise important differences in economic fundamentals and other political factors. This article examines the process through which these countries came to be grouped together and explores the contagion effect in sovereign bond markets during the period 2010-2015. Using panel vector autoregression, Bayesian vector autoregression, and Granger causality, I show how the number of articles containing the acronym PIIGS in reference only to the other countries in the group affect the bond spreads of a given country beyond what political conditions and economic fundamentals would predict. The results show that all countries except Greece may have paid a substantial economic price from being labeled as PIIGS (and from being associated, in particular, with Greece). The analysis highlights the relevance of investorsâ€™ perceptions and discourse in interpreting (and misinterpreting) the role of economic fundamentals and underlines how the use of acronyms as heuristic tools affects financial contagion.
