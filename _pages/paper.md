**Title:** ["*Self-Defeating Treaties: Global Value Chains and the Termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Deep integration into global value chains (GVCs) effectively protects foreign investors’ property rights, making bilateral investment treaties (BITs) less relevant. Hence, countries with deeper GVC integration are more likely to terminate BITs. With GVCs’ positive spillovers to the host country's economy, governments with great social welfare concerns can credibly commit to respecting property rights. As democratic institutions can serve as a public signal of high social welfare concerns, we expect a stronger substitute effect of GVCs for BITs in democracies than in autocracies. Using value-added in trade indicators at the dyad level to measure GVC integration, this paper finds that dyads with deeper GVC integration are more likely to have BITs termination. Meanwhile, when GVC integration is high, democracies are more likely to unilaterally terminate BITs. Using the investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS) mechanism to measure treaty violations, this paper further shows that at a high level of GVC integration, democracies are less likely to be respondents to ISDS disputes than autocracies are. Given that BITs are originally designed to facilitate the development of GVCs, this paper reveals the self-defeating nature of BITs.
