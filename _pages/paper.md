**Title:** ["*Foreign Aid and Power Play: Political Cycle in World Bank's Procurement Allocation*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
This paper investigates the existence of a political cycle in World Bank’s procurement contracts allocation. Using a model intended to predict the determinants of the average amount in dollars for procurement contracts won by supplier firms in a given semester and recipient country, our results suggest that: 1) Domestic firms win larger contracts around the election in the recipient country. Additional results also indicate hints of cronyism, since the domestic preference is particularly intense around elections in recipient countries where corporations are allowed to donate to candidates. 2) Foreign firms win larger contracts after the election in the recipient country, especially when foreign corporations are allowed to contribute to a candidate’s electoral campaign. 3) Foreign firms win larger contracts before the election in the supplier firm’s origin country. Firms would indeed win 43% bigger World Bank procurement contracts one semester before an election in their home country. Further results also provide strong hints of a supplier to recipient influence in procurement contract attribution, since this cross-country political cycle occurs especially when suppliers and recipients are significant aid partners.
