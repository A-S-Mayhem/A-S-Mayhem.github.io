**Title:** ["*Intellectual Property, Public Health, and the Influence of Experts.*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Cynthia_Couette_14FEB2022.pdf)

**Abstract:**
The global governance interface between public health and intellectual property (IP) is particularly complex as rights overlap: the right to health and the right to IP. Equipped with flexibilities, the global patent regime was conceived in a way that should have allowed it to evolve and respond to public health concerns. However, a quarter of a century later, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrusted into the spotlight a hesitant global governance relying on a substantially unchanged multilateral framework. If international law partly explains the regulatory complexity of this interface, international political economy offers explanation for its remarkable continuity. Adopting a broader conceptualization of epistemic communities, this research shows that this interface fosters an epistemic competition where networks of experts, by providing their expertise and circulating ideas, influence the normative framing of the issue. A social network analysis based on the events of the WHO, WIPO, WTO Trilateral Cooperation on public health, IP and commerce provides centrality indicators for each epistemic community. Interviews with key experts then allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the epistemic competition mechanisms at play. Presenting its preliminary results, this research contributes to the understanding and democratization of this global governance interface.
