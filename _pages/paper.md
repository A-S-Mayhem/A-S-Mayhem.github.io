**Title:** ["*Innovation and Interdependence: The Case of Gene-Editing Technology*.*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Cleo_OBrien_15NOV2021.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Technological breakthroughs often disrupt social, economic, and political systems, posing unique challenges for governments. In this paper, we examine how breakthroughs shape patterns of interdependence between states. We argue that rapid technological advancement increases interdependence among national governments in two ways. First, it lowers barriers to entry and creates opportunities for forum-shopping by researchers, firms, and other actors. This facilitates arbitrage as actors relocate to more permissive jurisdictions, generating incentives for regulatory competition. Second, public unease about new technologies creates the potential for backlash against controversial applications. This backlash can spill across borders: accidents or misuse in one jurisdiction undermines support for research and commercial development elsewhere. Together, these processes create incentives for states to mismanage risk, generating inefficient cycles of accelerated progress disrupted by damaging controversies. We test these mechanisms in the case of gene editing, a field that has experienced rapid technological advancement in recent years. We find support for the theory in patterns of gene editing research, social media data, and a novel survey experiment. Our results demonstrate that technological disruption increases interdependence, undermining states' ability to regulate in isolation and strengthening the case for international policy coordination.
