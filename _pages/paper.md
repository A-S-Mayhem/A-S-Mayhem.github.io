**Title:** ["*Brexit and Global Value Chains: Beyond the UK and the EU*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
The discussion on Brexit has focused more on the future trade relationship between the EU and the UK. However, Brexit will also have significant impacts on the rest of the world, most often ignored in the public debate, particularly in countries with the UK as their major trading partner. Besides, some of these countries rely heavily on the larger EU markets for imports. Primarily, in this paper, I estimate the impact of several post-Brexit trade policies on global value chain participation and positioning and the welfare gains from trade - in the UK, EU27, and the rest of the world. First, I build a multi-country multi-sector static general equilibrium model of trade policy shock, which is a variant of the Armington model, to quantify the impact of these different post-Brexit scenarios. Second, for counterfactual exercises, I calibrate the model to match Eora input-output data and the state of the world before Brexit. The various potential post-Brexit scenarios include Hard Brexit, Soft Brexit, UK-USA FTA, and UK-EU-US FTA. I find hard Brexit to be the worst-case, with losses ranging from 0.005 to 0.4385 percent and an average loss of 0.2166 percent in total consumption-equivalent welfare of households. Also, I find that the UK-US bilateral agreement has a gain for the USA and a loss of 0.0367 percent for the UK. The effect on GVC participation and positioning is significant for other countries than the UK and the EU. Some countries affected most are Japan, India, Hong Kong, and Kenya. The USA is the only large economy found to be less integrated into GVCs.
