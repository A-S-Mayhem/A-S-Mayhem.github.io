**Title:** ["*Common Benefit, Threat to Withdraw and Order in Global Club Goods Provision.*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Qi_Liu_04OCT2021.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Unlike membership of IOs, membership of global club goods is often unobserved, but still affects state behavior. Sharing global public and club goods can increase common benefits and threatening power of the dominant state, which can both shape states' behavior. Employing social network analysis, we use network community to capture global club good membership and use hierarchy to measure the structure of club good provision. Focusing on global financial safety, we argue that states sharing financial safety through bilateral swap agreements vote closer in the UN and sanction each other less. More importantly, swap agreement communities with flatter structures have stronger order. Using an original dataset on swap agreements, empirical results support our arguments and we claim that collective resource-sharing provides stronger incentives for order maintenance which cannot be made up by the dominant's threat to withdraw.
