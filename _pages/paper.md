**Title:** ["*No Diffusion at All: Trade, Free Riding, and Government Underspending on Environmental Innovation.*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Muzhou_Zhang_29NOV2021.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Governments have an irreplaceable role in supporting environmental technologies due to market failure. Nevertheless, I develop a free riding argument that the trade-driven technology transfer incentivizes national governments to strategically underspend on environmental innovation. The data of public research and development (R&D) expenditures and bilateral trade volumes from 32 OECD countries, 1982â€“2017, is employed to substantiate my argument. Spatial regression finds that government spending on environmental R&D in one country is negatively correlated with such expense from its trading partners in the preceding year. Beyond environmental politics, this article challenges the influential diffusion theory by showing that the strengthening transnational connectivity may actually enable countries to be free riders rather than followers.
