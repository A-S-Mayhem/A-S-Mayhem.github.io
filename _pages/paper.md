**Title:** ["* Who Complies? When Interdependence Meets IO Independence.*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/Zoe_Ge_13DEC2021.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Why do some states comply with the disease outbreak reporting requirement at the World Health Organization (WHO) while others do not? Information dissemination of disease outbreaks can trigger the international community to impose trade and travel bans to states with weak linkages and provide resources to states with strong linkages. Due to such heterogeneous responses, states with high interdependence with the community comply and report, while states with low interdependence conceal the outbreaks. To induce compliance in reporting, the WHO reformed its International Health Regulations (IHR) in 2005, which grants the WHO independence to disseminate outbreak information without the consent of the outbreak country. I argue that such independence in information dissemination allows the WHO to leverage the interdependence among the states and trigger punishment on information withhold, which deters non-compliance. Using the number of Disease Outbreak News (DONs) as an indicator of state's compliance, I find that states with strong linkages to the U.S. have more DONs reports before the reform. The reform increases the number of DONs reports from states with weak linkages to the U.S.
