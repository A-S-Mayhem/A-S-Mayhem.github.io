**Title:** ["*Spillover effects of subsidies on downstream trade*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
Corporate subsidies are at the center of the political, economic, and trade policy debate as a major source of controversy in the world trading system. Subsidization of industrial activities is often considered to distort the allocation of scarce resources and generate friction in international trade. Much attention has been devoted to direct subsidies, but there is scarce evidence on the indirect effect of government support on downstream trade. In the present study, I use detailed information on US subsidies to examine the effect of government support on the export performance of the recipient industries and industries that use subsidized goods and services as inputs of production. I address endogeneity concerns by re-adapting a shift-share instrument developed by Bown et al. (2021). The instrument leverages the exogenous variation in the political importance of US battleground states across electoral terms and the importance of industries within states. I estimate that corporate subsidies boost the export performance of the targeted industries and increase exports of indirectly exposed (downstream) industries.
