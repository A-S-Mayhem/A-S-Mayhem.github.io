**Title:** ["*Reputation as a Binding Constraint - How States Navigate TRIPS Flexibilities*"](https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/files/paper_gsipe_workshop.pdf)

**Abstract:**
To alleviate the distributional consequences of multilateral trade agreements on intellectual property, international trade organization preserves the rights to invoke certain exceptions with no strings attached. When do nations explore this freedom, and how does international institution govern the abuse? In this paper, I argue that states leverage on these escape clauses to defend national interests against coercion in bilateral trade negotiations. If a signatory abuses such remedies beyond restoring the balance in concession, however, then other parties inform third countries of its opportunistic behaviors for punishment, whose monitoring and communication are mediated by the institution. To test my arguments, I collect new datasets on TRIPS Flexibilities and the scope of intellectual property protection varying across bilateral treaties from 1995 to 2012. A longitudinal network analysis corroborates my claims, where I also find that nations care about reputation to various degrees, depending on how many neighbors maintain a `good' image in the world economy. The results demonstrate how escape clauses serve the needs of the weak in a disciplined manner.
