2020-2024 Wuhan University, BCs of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics
-----

>This is a 4-year undergraduate program at Wuhan University, and I anticipate receiving my degree in June 2024. As part of my academic journey, I hold the esteemed title of Hongyi Honor Student at Wuhan University. Upon successful completion of this program, I am expected to be awarded a **Hongyi Honor Degree**. During the 2020-2021 academic year, I was affiliated with the [Hongyi Honor College](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/), and for the remaining three years, I have been a member of the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/index.htm).

2023-2024 Universite III Toulouse-Paul Sabatier, Master 1 of Mathematics 
-----
>I am currently affiliated with [EUR MINT](https://mint.math.univ-toulouse.fr/fr/) (L’Ecole Universitaire de Recherche "Mathématiques et INteractions à Toulouse"), which is a Mathematics Master Program located in Toulouse, France. I am in the process of completing my Master 1 in MINT, which is scheduled to take place from September 2023 to July 2024.

Allow me to clarify the overlap in my educational timeline. The program at WHU was originally designed as a four-year program, however, I successfully fulfilled the requirements for a Bachelor's Degree by the end of my third year. As a result, I made the decision to embark on my Master's Degree in Toulouse during what would have been my fourth year of undergraduate studies. It is worth noting that undergraduate programs in France conventionally span three years.
