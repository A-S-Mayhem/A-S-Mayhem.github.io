### 3rd Annual Land Data Assimilation Community Virtual Workshop: Recent Technical Developments in Land Data Assimilation, 19th-21st June 10am-1pm EDT, Online 
[Submit your abstracts and/or breakout group proposals by 19 April 2023](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfctXyIC96nls4DyaJ6YheCHoKyh9klsgO87AkpVBCVPyRWZg/viewform)

>**When:** Wednesday, 19 June 2023 to 21 June 2023, 10:00-13:00 EDT // 16:00-19:00 CEST
>
>**Organizers:** Andy Fox (NASA GSFC, USA), Jana Kolassa (NASA GSFC, USA), Natasha MacBean (Western University, Canada), Tristan Quaife (University of Reading, UK), Hannah Liddy (AIMES, Columbia University, USA)
>
>**Overview:** The goals of the workshop build on the goals of the AIMES Land DA Working Group to: 1) foster knowledge exchange across all groups working in land data assimilation; and 2) build a community of practice and collaboration in land DA, particularly for addressing the technical challenges we face in implementing land DA systems. This workshop also builds on the outcomes of the 1st Land DA workshop in 2021, which is summarized in this [review article](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022MS003259) and [meeting report](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-21-0228.1) and the [2nd annual workshop in 2022](https://aimesproject.org/lda_workshop_2022/). We are seeking talks that place greater weight on addressing the technical challenges associated with developing land DA systems than answering the scientific questions that lie behind those technical developments, which is typically the focus of other professional meetings and conferences. 
>
>**Format:** This meeting will take place virtually, but we will facilitate interactions through a virtual poster session and discussion rooms on SpatialChat in addition to talks. Further, we are working on a plan to facilitate asynchronous participation from regions that cannot attend the main meeting due to timezone differences, and we encourage people in those timezones to still submit an abstract. In the form below, please indicate if you would like to submit an abstract for a talk or poster. 
>
>**Please use [this template](https://aimesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/YOUR-NAME_LDAC-2023-Abstract-Template.doc) to upload your abstract.** 
> 
>**Call for abstracts:** We invite you to submit your abstracts for oral or poster presentations and/or breakout group proposals [here].(https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfctXyIC96nls4DyaJ6YheCHoKyh9klsgO87AkpVBCVPyRWZg/viewform) 
>
>**Deadline:** 19 April 2023
>
>We are looking forward to continuing to build the Land DA Community and to seeing your abstracts! And we strongly encourage participation from early career researchers!
