## [2nd Annual Land DA Community Workshop: "New Directions in Land Data Assimilation" Call for Abstracts](https://aimesproject.org/lda_workshop2/)


The AIMES Land Data Assimilation Working Group will hold its 2nd annual workshop ‘New Directions in Land Data Assimilation’ on 13-15 June 2022 from 10:00 – 13:00 EDT/16:00-19:00 CEST. The goals of the workshop build on the principles of the working group to (1) foster knowledge exchange across all groups working in land DA, (2) to build a community of practice and collaboration in land DA, particularly for addressing the technical challenges we face in implementing DA systems. The themes of the workshop were identified by the land DA community during the 2021 meeting on 'Tackling Technical Challenges in Land DA' and through feedback from a post-workshop survey.

We now invite abstract submissions for oral or poster presentations that address one of the following main themes: 
(1) Machine Learning in Land DA
(2) Observation and Model Uncertainty
(3) Ensemble DA methods
(4) Crossover in Land DA challenges between Numerical Weather Prediction and Land Surface Modeling communities
 
We are seeking abstracts that put greater weight on addressing the technical challenges associated with developing land DA systems than answering the scientific questions that lie behind those technical developments, which is typically the focus of other professional meetings and conferences. Oral presentations will prioritize the themes identified above. However, we will also consider abstracts that address important topics beyond the designated themes.

We are looking forward to continuing to build the land DA community and to seeing your abstracts! 
## The deadline to submit your abstract is Friday, March 4, 2022. 
## [Submit your abstracts here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevnECTNo586caKq1Y8mBW_So6v7s0ZZxFqptSmwbCgNDOZhA/viewform) 
Email [aimes@futureearth.org](aimes@futureearth.org) with any questions.

## *Past*

## [1st Annual Land DA Community Workshop: "Tackling Technical Challenges in Land Data Assimilation" (June 2021)](https://aimesproject.org/lda_workshop/)

#### Workshop Overview
There is growing consensus that land surface models need to be confronted with a wide range of data to constrain uncertainty in parameters, initialize surface states, and address model structural uncertainty. However, there are limited opportunities at scientific meetings to specifically discuss the challenges faced by modeling teams when implementing data assimilation (DA) techniques. To strengthen communication between modeling groups, this workshop will bring together land DA scientists to highlight a range of DA methods used within the community, discuss challenges facing different modeling communities, and identify strategies for addressing those challenges. We welcome participation from a broad range of research interests including land surface states and fluxes (carbon, energy, and water cycles to crop, fire, and land management), timescales (daily, seasonal to subseasonal, centennial/millennial), and scientific and practical applications (improving understanding of carbon-climate feedbacks, weather prediction, agricultural forecasting, and climate change impacts). The outcome of this workshop is to increase collaboration and coordination within the land DA community to tackle technical challenges and promote the routine use of DA tools in the wider modeling community.

#### Workshop Agenda: 
This workshop is focused on the technical challenges of data assimilation, and we have a great lineup of technically-focused, thought-provoking talks that allow ample time for discussion. The second half of each day will be dedicated to making connections between land DA communities, increasing knowledge exchange to tackle land DA challenges, and building a collaborative land DA community inclusive of all backgrounds and career stages
