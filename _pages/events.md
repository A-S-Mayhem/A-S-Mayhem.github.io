## *Upcoming*

### Town Hall on Machine Learning for Land Data Assimilation, 22 February 2023, Online 
[Register Here by 15 February 2023](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesbFwtFprNswq0DwspVS7T3mQFNHh35Gg1TSDz-s-C7wLgDA/viewform)

>**When:** Wednesday, February 22 | 10:00-12:00 EST // 16:00-18:00 CET
>**Organizers:** Istem Fer (Finnish Meteorological Institute, Finland), Jana Kolassa (NASA GSFC, USA), Natasha MacBean (Western University, Canada)
>
>**Overview:** Earth observations of the land surface have proliferated over the past decade, and the urgency to use these data to improve land modeling and data assimilation (DA) systems has opened up avenues into the data sciences. The application of machine learning algorithms has led to the improvement of existing (physically-based) retrieval algorithms and, in the context of DA, have been used to construct observation operators that when trained on the model can simultaneously be used to bias-correct the observations. Machine learning has further led to improvements in the analysis of model-data mismatch and has the potential to reduce the costs of computationally expensive DA systems. However, in this nascent area of research, there is a need to exchange knowledge about emerging tools and methods for machine learning that can be used to improve land DA systems. The Land DA Community is organizing this town hall to (1) showcase recent developments in machine learning, (2) provide an opportunity to share and discuss research with your colleagues, and (3) identify next steps that the land DA community should take to advance the development of machine learning tools to improve land DA systems.
>
>In particular, we ask participants to consider: 
>
> - In what ways can new machine learning tools be modified and combined with existing land DA systems? 
> - How can the land DA community support the scattered development of methodologies and foster critical understanding of the trade-offs of methodological choices? 
> 
>Through posters and lightning talks, attendees can share their methodologies, address challenges, and meet others working in this area. Machine learning >applications in land DA is a new area of research, and we are aiming to help shape the dialogue and exchange knowledge about best practices moving >forward.

>
>**Overview:** As a solution to nonlinear problems in land surface modeling, ensemble data assimilation techniques have been successfully implemented by the land, hydrological, biogeochemical modeling communities to improve land surface water and carbon cycle predictions. While these methodological advances have resulted in innovative development and reduced the computational burden of analysis, there remain challenges to the technique that need to be addressed by the land DA community. In this Town Hall, we invite participants to explore the benefits and challenges of assimilating land observations using ensemble based techniques.
>
>In particular, we ask participants to consider:
>
> - How can we optimally treat bounded variables?
> - What approaches can be used when distributions are highly non-gaussian?
> - What developments beyond the traditional ensemble Kalman filter, including rank histogram, smoothers and particle filters, might be most useful for land DA?
> - What inflation methods are suitable for land models to maintain ensemble spread adequately?
> - Can we couple neural networks and ensemble data assimilation, such as for surrogating models and observation operators and mitigating forecast bias?
> - How can we apply techniques such as localization to avoid the impact of spurious correlations in space and/or time?
> - Can you assimilate un-recognized measurements in land DA?
> - What are the possibilities of developing low cost ensembles using machine learning?
> - To achieve balance in atmospheric and land surface parameters, what are the needs of coupled land surface DA systems?
>
>Through posters and lightning talks, attendees can share their methodologies, address challenges, and meet others working in this area. The goal of this town hall is to provide a venue to address the technical challenges associated with the development of ensemble data assimilation techniques and to identify if there are additional needs that can be addressed through opportunities to convene the land DA community.
