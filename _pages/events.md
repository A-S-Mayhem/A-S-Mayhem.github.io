## [Open Registration for the 2nd Annual Land DA Community Workshop: "New Directions in Land Data Assimilation"](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjikwX9Lp-cfW8l-HPCrrtgqlERTLwuGIzrUZhedKvwS1IRA/viewform)

### 13-15 June 2022 | 10:00-13:00 EDT // 16:00-19:00 CEST
### Organizers†: Natasha MacBean (1), Jana Kolassa (2), Andy Fox (3), Tristan Quaife (4), Hannah Liddy (5)
(1) Indiana University, (2) NASA GMAO, (3) Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation, (4) University of Reading, (5) Columbia University/NASA GISS

† Organized by the AIMES Land Data Assimilation Working Group

Workshop Overview: The goals of this workshop build on the AIMES Land DA Working Group’s objectives to address the technical challenges we face when implementing DA systems by (1) fostering knowledge exchange across all groups working in land DA and (2) building a community of practice and collaboration in land DA. We therefore welcome participation from a broad range of research interests including land surface states and fluxes (carbon, energy, and water cycles to crop, fire, and land management), timescales (daily, seasonal to subseasonal, centennial/millennial), and scientific and practical applications (improving understanding of carbon-climate feedbacks, weather prediction, agricultural forecasting, and climate change impacts). The outcome of this workshop is to increase collaboration and coordination within the land DA community to tackle technical challenges and promote the routine use of DA tools in the wider modeling community. This workshop also builds on the first land DA workshop, which is summarized in this meeting report: https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-21-0228.1

Opportunities to Contribute to the Program: With this workshop, we are seeking to foster an interactive environment, and we welcome ideas from the community to encourage discussion and build connections between land DA practitioners. Therefore, in the registration there is also an opportunity to submit the following:

*Posters*: we are calling for posters that either address technical challenges associated with developing land data assimilation (DA), promote community building activities that would further advance the land DA community, or provide an overview of the DA work conducted within DA groups or institutes.

*Breakout Group Proposals*: we are seeking breakout group ideas that will help foster more interactions and opportunities for research and collaborations in the land DA community. If you would like to volunteer to lead a breakout group, please provide us with a short proposal (1-3 sentences) for topics that aim to build collaborations (e.g., collaboration on a calibrated MIP, development of DA training materials, hackathon, discussion on particular technical issues, etc.). The proposals will be reviewed by the workshop planning committee, and you will be contacted if chosen.

*“Career Corner” Advertisements*: we will organize a virtual ‘career corner’ where we will advertise job postings and/or set up a virtual coffee table/meeting space to talk with candidates. Please share any opportunities with us by email at aimes@futureearth.org.

### Deadlines:
### Poster submissions: Monday, April 25th at 12:00 EDT
### Breakout Group Proposals: Monday, April 25th at 12:00 EDT
### Registration: Wednesday, June 1st at 12:00 EDT

If anyone cannot access the Google form please contact us aimes@futureearth.org to register by email.

## [2nd Annual Land DA Community Workshop: "New Directions in Land Data Assimilation" Call for Abstracts](https://aimesproject.org/lda_workshop2/)


The AIMES Land Data Assimilation Working Group will hold its 2nd annual workshop ‘New Directions in Land Data Assimilation’ on 13-15 June 2022 from 10:00 – 13:00 EDT/16:00-19:00 CEST. The goals of the workshop build on the principles of the working group to: (1) foster knowledge exchange across all groups working in land DA and (2) build a community of practice and collaboration in land DA, particularly for addressing the technical challenges we face in implementing DA systems. The themes of the workshop were identified by the land DA community during the 2021 meeting on 'Tackling Technical Challenges in Land DA' and through feedback from a post-workshop survey.

We now invite abstract submissions for oral or poster presentations that address one of the following main themes: 
(1) Machine Learning in Land DA
(2) Observation and Model Uncertainty
(3) Ensemble DA methods
(4) Crossover in Land DA challenges between Numerical Weather Prediction and Land Surface Modeling communities
 
We are seeking abstracts that put greater weight on addressing the technical challenges associated with developing land DA systems than answering the scientific questions that lie behind those technical developments, which is typically the focus of other professional meetings and conferences. Oral presentations will prioritize the themes identified above. However, we will also consider abstracts that address important topics beyond the designated themes.

We are looking forward to continuing to build the land DA community and to seeing your abstracts! Email aimes(at)futureearth.org with any questions.
### The deadline to submit your abstract is Friday, March 4, 2022. [Submit your abstracts here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevnECTNo586caKq1Y8mBW_So6v7s0ZZxFqptSmwbCgNDOZhA/viewform) 


## *Past*

## [1st Annual Land DA Community Workshop: "Tackling Technical Challenges in Land Data Assimilation" (June 2021)](https://aimesproject.org/lda_workshop/)

#### Workshop Overview
There is growing consensus that land surface models need to be confronted with a wide range of data to constrain uncertainty in parameters, initialize surface states, and address model structural uncertainty. However, there are limited opportunities at scientific meetings to specifically discuss the challenges faced by modeling teams when implementing data assimilation (DA) techniques. To strengthen communication between modeling groups, this workshop will bring together land DA scientists to highlight a range of DA methods used within the community, discuss challenges facing different modeling communities, and identify strategies for addressing those challenges. We welcome participation from a broad range of research interests including land surface states and fluxes (carbon, energy, and water cycles to crop, fire, and land management), timescales (daily, seasonal to subseasonal, centennial/millennial), and scientific and practical applications (improving understanding of carbon-climate feedbacks, weather prediction, agricultural forecasting, and climate change impacts). The outcome of this workshop is to increase collaboration and coordination within the land DA community to tackle technical challenges and promote the routine use of DA tools in the wider modeling community.

#### Workshop Agenda: 
This workshop is focused on the technical challenges of data assimilation, and we have a great lineup of technically-focused, thought-provoking talks that allow ample time for discussion. The second half of each day will be dedicated to making connections between land DA communities, increasing knowledge exchange to tackle land DA challenges, and building a collaborative land DA community inclusive of all backgrounds and career stages
