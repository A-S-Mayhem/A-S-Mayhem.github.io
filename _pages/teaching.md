During my time at Imperial College London, I was teaching assistant for the following courses:

- Advanced Classical Physics (3rd Year UG), 2022
  - Solutions to Problem Sheet: [1](../files/teaching/acpps01.pdf), [2](../files/teaching/acpps02.pdf), [3](../files/teaching/acpps03.pdf), [4](../files/teaching/acpps04.pdf), [5](../files/teaching/acpps05.pdf), [6](../files/teaching/acpps06.pdf), [7](../files/teaching/acpps07.pdf), [8](../files/teaching/acpps08.pdf), [9](../files/teaching/acpps09.pdf), [10](../files/teaching/acpps10.pdf)
- Advanced Quantum Field Theory (MSc QFFF), 2020-2022
  - Solutions to Problem Sheet: [1](../files/teaching/aqftps1.pdf), [2](../files/teaching/aqftps2.pdf), [3](../files/teaching/aqftps3.pdf), [4](../files/teaching/aqftps4.pdf), [5](../files/teaching/aqftps5.pdf)
- Quantum Mechanics (2nd Year UG), 2020-2021

I also lectured a mini-course as part of the MSc QFFF "Special Topics" Series:

- JT Gravity, 2023-2024
  - [Notes](jtnotes.pdf)

In 2023, I also mentored a group of high school students at the Imperial College Maths School on a research project on topological invariants, featured [here](https://www.imperialmathsschool.ac.uk/studentresearchprojects2023).
