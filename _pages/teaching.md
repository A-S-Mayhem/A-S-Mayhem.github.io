## Machine Learning Operations

I am the main lecture on course 02476 Machine Learning Operations at Technical University of Denmark, having developed most of the material myself.

Webpage: <https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops>

DTU course page: <https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02476>

The course introduces students to a number of coding practices that will help them organization, scale, monitor and deploy machine learning models either in a research or production setting. To provide hands-on experience with a number of frameworks, both local and in the cloud, for doing large scale machine learning models.
