## Teaching and Supervision
- I am a Moodle Tutor for the UCL Resources for New Chemistry Researchers (Computational Chemistry) module, having helped develop the online resoruces for this course.

### Project Supervision
As well as of course working with colleagues in both my research groups on several projects and lending my knowledge and expertise where possible, I am directly supervising a PhD student, and am co-supervising 5 other PhD research projects for novice students.
I have supervised many Masters' (MSci and MSc) and summer student research projects, a large proportion of which have led to significant research outputs suitable for publication, as well as prizes and awards in recognition of research excellence.

These include:
- _Spontaneous symmetry breaking by point defects in crystalline hosts. How to identify them?_ <!-- Irea; MKWS -->
  - Mosquera-Lois, I.; Kavanagh, S. R. In Search of Hidden Defects. _**Matter**_ 2021, 4 (8), 2602–2605. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2021.06.003.
  - Further manuscripts in preparation
- _Theoretical Study of Metal Chalcogenide Alloys for Solar Cell Applications_ <!-- Helen; Sb2(S/Se)3 Alloys -->
  - Manuscript in preparation
  - MSci Student Helen Spong was awarded the Neil Sharp Prize for best performance in Theoretical/Computational Chemistry with this research project – a fantastic achievement given the large number of world-class computational research groups in the UCL Chemistry Department.
- _A computational re-evaluation of elemental solar absorber materials_ <!-- Alp; Se for PV -->
  - Manuscript in preparation
- _Emerging Cu-based earth-abundant photovoltaic absorber materials_ <!-- Bodoo and Adair; Cu2SiSe3 for PV -->
  - Manuscript in preparation
- _Computational Analysis of Novel Inorganic Materials for Photovoltaic Applications_ <!-- Stan -->
- _An investigation into CsSnI3 as an alternative to lead-based perovskite photovoltaics_ <!-- Daniel -->
- _A computational re-evaluation of crystal structure assignments for vacancy-ordered quadruple perovskites_ <!-- Yinan... -->


Some quotes from MSc students I have supervised are:
>I am very pleased and lucky that I could receive the invaluable support and guidance of Seán Kavanagh in conducting my research project about simulation calculations on the materials of perovskite solar cells... His explanations were very detailed, coherent, and easy to understand. Seán Kavanagh with his patience, helpful insight, and brilliance helped me a lot throughout the project.

> Sean provided me with a lot of support throughout my MSci project. He contacted me regularly and organised meetings to check my progress and talk to me about the next steps of my project. He explained how to set up all of my VASP calculations and what to do with the results I obtained. He also helped me troubleshoot errors and provided possible explanations for new and unusual results when I got stuck. <!-- Alp -->

In addition, I have given private tuition for undergraduate and high-school students in Chemistry, Physics and Maths (as well as French, Irish and Biology) for over 4 years, helping to develop my teaching and communication skills, in addition to organisation and time management. I have worked with over 30 students, consistently resulting in high performance and exam success for tutees. Some quotes from reviews/feedback include:

> I highly recommend Sean for tutoring, I went to him for my leaving cert (_A-levels_) and he explained everything so clearly and made it so simple to learn and if it wasn’t for Sean I wouldn’t have passed my leaving cert (_A-levels_). Highly recommend. <!-- Sophie -->

> Sean is a fantastic chemistry teacher. I struggled with chemistry but Sean has the ability to describe each aspect of the chemistry course in an easy to understand way and with an abundance of patience. I now am feeling much more confident as I approach my exams. <!-- Matt, via mam Karen -->
