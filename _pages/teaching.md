I am passionate about teaching and enjoy developing new materials to explain hard concepts. I love seeing a concept "click" when an explaination works best for a given student's understanding. My favorite part about teaching is 1-1 student interaction, which feels like the most concrete way I can improve the climate and culture of academia, by lifting up one student at a time. I believe that getting to know students as people is the best way to understand and resolve conceptual gaps. And of course, every time I teach a concept I learn something myself either from great student questions or in the course of refining and improving examples or analogies.
