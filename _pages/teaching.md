## Teaching and Supervision
- I am a Moodle Tutor for the UCL Resources for New Chemistry Researchers (Computational Chemistry) module, having helped develop the online resoruces for this course.

- I have given private tuition for undergraduate and high-school students in Chemistry, Physics and Maths (as well as French, Irish and Biology) for over 4 years, helping to develop my teaching and communication skills, in addition to organisation and time management. I have worked with over 30 students, consistently resulting in high performance and exam success for tutees. Some quotes from reviews/feedback include:

### Project Supervision
As well as of course working with colleagues in both my research groups on several projects and lending my knowledge and expertise where possible, I am directly supervising a PhD student, and am co-supervising 5 other PhD research projects for novice students.
I have supervised many Masters' (MSci and MSc) and summer student research projects, a large proportion of which have led to significant research outputs suitable for publication.
These include:
- _Spontaneous symmetry breaking by point defects in crystalline hosts. How to identify them?_
  - Mosquera-Lois, I.; Kavanagh, S. R. In Search of Hidden Defects. _**Matter**_ 2021, 4 (8), 2602â€“2605. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2021.06.003.
  - Further manuscripts in preparation
- _Theoretical Study of Antimony Selenosulfide Alloys for Solar Cell Applications_
  - Manuscript in preparation
- _A computational re-evaluation of selenium as a solar absorber_
  - Manuscript in preparation
- _Cu2SiSe3: An emerging earth-abundant photovoltaic absorber material_
  - Manuscript in preparation
- _Computational Analysis of Novel Inorganic Materials for Photovoltaic Applications_
- _An investigation into CsSnI3 as an alternative to lead-based perovskite photovoltaics_
- _A computational re-evaluation of crystal structure assignments for vacancy-ordered quadruple perovskites_
