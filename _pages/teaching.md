In Spring 2022, I am a visiting leturer at Wesleyan University. The syllabus for my course, Political Economy of Foreign Aid, is available <a href="https://cobrienudry.github.io/files/syllabus.pdf">here</a>.

As a teaching assistant at Yale, I have taught:
- Introduction to Internaitonal Relations (undergraduate, Spring 2021)
- Visualization of Political and Social Data (undergraduate, Fall 2020)
- Quantitative Methods II: Foundations of Statistical Inference (graduate, Spring 2021)
- Legacies of Conflict and Communism in Europe (undergraduate, Fall 2019); guest lecturer (2019, 2020, 2021)

Prior to graduate school, I taught English for Serbian, Roma, and Albanian students as Peace Corps vounteer in Kosovo (2015-2017).
