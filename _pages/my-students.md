I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate and Research Assistant at the University of Delaware, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I have always loved learning, growing, developing, and challenging myself to contribute to something significant. The whole point of learning more is to be able to make a difference in the world. My purpose is to help the world run better.

My research interests include:

        optimizing compilers,
        programming methodologies,
        source-to-source Translators,
        performance evaluation for HPC,
        best practices and tools in computational and data-intensive research,
        using ML, deep learning, and NLP to solve problems that cannot be solved in traditional ways.

<b>Research Topic: iCetus, An Interactive Parallelizing Compiler</b>
<img src="../images/my-students/Parinaz/pimage.jpg" width="300" 
     height="300" alt="Parinaz">

<b>Project Description: </b> Today’s computers are all multicore. In a modern shared-memory architecture, parallelization techniques enable us to utilize multiple processors simultaneously and improve the performance of an application by converting sequential code into multi-threaded and/or vectorized code. 

Our goal is to develop a tool that allows users with varying skill sets to apply parallelization techniques interactively. While the tool can parallelize the code/ parts of the code in a fully automatic format for Non-expert users,  Power users can finely steer the optimization process through the tool menus to obtain an optimized version of the code.

<h3>The Xpert Network --A Peer Network for the exchange of computational best practices and support environments</h3>

<img src="../images/research/xpert.png" width="300" 
     height="300" alt="xpert">
Through a series of online and face-to-face meetings we are aiming to create synergy among teams that assist researchers in developing, optimizing, and running computational and data-intensive applications. We also connect developers of tools that help accomplish these tasks. We welcome participation from large, national projects as well as from individuals that assist computational researchers or develop supporting environments.

     height="300" alt="spec30">

We are creating HPC benchmarks that are representative of real-world applications. This is a collaboration with the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation, <a href="http://spec.org">SPEC</a> and Indiana University. <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1842623">NSF award page</a>. <a href="https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2020/june/sunita-chandrasekaran-rudi-eigenmann-supercomputer-benchmarks/">News release</a>

<h3>Cetus Source-to-Source Compiler Infrastructure</h3>

 Cetus is a compiler and transformation infrastructure for transforming C source code. The original purpose of Cetus was for automatic parallelization - translation of C code into C code annotated with OpenMP directives. Many other uses of the translator have emerged, such as the translation of OpenMP programs into CUDA and MPI. Cetus is being maintained as a community infrastructure and has been used for many projects worldwide (see the list of publications on the Cetus web page).
The Cetus project is a collaboration with Purdue University. NSF awards:
