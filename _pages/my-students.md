I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate and Research Assistant at the University of Delaware, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I have always loved learning, growing, developing, and challenging myself to contribute to something significant. The whole point of learning more is to be able to make a difference in the world. My purpose is to help the world run better.

My research interests include:

        optimizing compilers,
        programming methodologies,
        source-to-source Translators,
        performance evaluation for HPC,
        best practices and tools in computational and data-intensive research,
        using ML, deep learning, and NLP to solve problems that cannot be solved in traditional ways.

<b>Research Topic: iCetus, An Interactive Parallelizing Compiler</b>
<img src="../images/my-students/Parinaz/pimage.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="DARWIN">

<b>Project Description: </b> Today’s computers are all multicore. In a modern shared-memory architecture, parallelization techniques enable us to utilize multiple processors simultaneously and improve the performance of an application by converting sequential code into multi-threaded and/or vectorized code. 

Our goal is to develop a tool that allows users with varying skill sets to apply parallelization techniques interactively. While the tool can parallelize the code/ parts of the code in a fully automatic format for Non-expert users,  Power users can finely steer the optimization process through the tool menus to obtain an optimized version of the code.

I am currently working towards my PhD at the University of Delaware in Newark,DE . My major is Computer Engineering.My Undergrad major was Electronics Engineering. I have completed coursework in a variety of areas ranging from web application security, computer architecture, secure software design to parallel programming, compilers , ML and cryptography. This page will give you a comprehensive overview of all my work.
Principal Research Interests

    Automatic Parallelization
    Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR)
    Source to Source Translators
    Parallel programming paradigms
    Compile-time analysis and transformation techniques

Other subjects/research areas of interest

<b>Research Topic: Subscripted subscript patterns</b>
<img src="../images/Akshay/pakshay.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Akshay">

<b>Project Description: </b> A number of scientific applications comprise of loops wherein an array is subscripted by another array - a[b[i]]. With write references to the host array (array ‘a’) within a loop, current compile-time techniques are incapable of detecting such loops as parallelizable. If left unparallelized, these loops can in-turn prevent the performance obtained through automatic parallelization, matching that of the hand parallelized version. Hence, Subscripted subscript analysis is the next big challenge in Automatic Parallelization.
