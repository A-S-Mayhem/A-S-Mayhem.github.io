I'm also a world-class [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) (MMO sandbox game for programmer) player. 
In Screeps, you write Javascript/Typescript code to control your creeps (basic units in this game) to construct your base, fight with others and expand your territory.
Each player only has limited CPU resources so you need to heavily optimize your code for performance.

My github repo for this game is [here](https://github.com/SUSYUSTC/screeps-ts) and free for non-commerial usage. Here are some record screenshots.
