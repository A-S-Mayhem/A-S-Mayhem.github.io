# Exhibits/Public Engagement

- How Gun Violence Affects Public Life and Public Health Exhibit. Chicago, IL, August 2018 

-How Gun Violence Affects Public Life and Public Health Exhibit. Pygmalion Festival. Urbana-Champaign, IL. September 2018 \\ \textit{This study seeks to examine the physiological effects of exposure to nearby gun crimes such as shootings as a way to document the lived experiences of African American mothers. We gathered one month of physiological data from African American mothers using wrist-worn wearable biosensors as well their physical movements as collected by their smartphone’s GPS. We visualized the data using heat maps, crime reports, art, etc.}}
