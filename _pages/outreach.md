## ERIRA (Educational Research in Radio Astronomy)

Since 2018 (I was a participant in 2017), I’ve been an educator/coordinator for ERIRA (Educational Research in Radio Astronomy). ERIRA is a week-long intensive astronomy research program that takes place at the Green Bank Radio Observatory (formerly NRAO), WV during the summer, founded and led by my undergraduate advisor Prof. Dan Reichart, for almost 30 years. During ERIRA, I mentor (mostly college) students in topics such as physical modeling, computer programming and machine learning, data science and machine learning, and other skills important to astronomy. ERIRA is one of my favorite times of the year, and is the greatest example of rapid collaboration and productivity that I’ve ever been a part of.
