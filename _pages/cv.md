# Research experience

I have more than seven years of research experience in Statistics. In 2013, after graduating, I worked with Prof. Duc Trong Dang to study the application of nonparametric regression techniques for solving the backward heat problems with statistical discrete data. In 2015 and 2018, I and Prof. Duc Trong Dang, together with other colleagues, published two papers on mathematical and statistical journals.

In 2014, I was selected as a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the Department of Statistical Sciences with the first rank in the ranking list of CARIPARO Ph.D. scholarship at the University of Padova, Italy. During three years of my Ph.D. program, I was working on the subject "Statistical evaluation of diagnostic tests under verification bias"s which is an interested topic in Medical Statistics. In particular, I and my supervisors (Prof. Monica Chiogna and Prof. Gianfranco Adimari) have investigated several methods, both parametric and nonparametric, to correct for verification bias in the evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy when the disease status has three categories (e.g., non-diseased, intermediate, diseased). For illustration, we applied our proposed methods to evaluate the accuracy of ovarian cancer-related tumor marker CA125 (which is a highly glycosylated sialomucin that is expressed on epithelial cell surface, especially on ovarian cancer cells) and to evaluate the ability of cerebrospinal fluid tau protein to discriminate between cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I developed an R package (named bcROCsurface) and a web interface to support researchers in the evaluation of predictive ability of diagnostic tests. As a result, I was awarded the Prize for Research 2017 of the department.
