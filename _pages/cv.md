  - Communication Engineering, Elite Class

## Internships

- 2021.06-2022.12 Intelligent System Research Group in BUPT
  - Interests: Data mining and Knowledge graph (Mentor: Chunhong Zhang)
  - Duty:
        - I constructed more than one hundred knowledge graphs of Electronic Information automatically by NER and RegEx; Our team built a web system that can mark examination papers automatically by OCR and vue, and we applied a patent for it; 
        Our team studied KG fusion and entity alignment, and we propose an automated knowledge extraction, data cleaning and graph fusion framework for heterogeneous learning resources. Our paper was submitted to ``ICALT2023".

  - Interest: Multimodal and Semantic communication (Mentor: Prof. Guoshun Nan)
  - Duty:-I do research in multimodal information fusion and semantic communication based on deep learning.
We propose a practical physical layer black-box attack method to destroy the robustness of  deep learning-based semantic communication systems, where the adversaries are imperceptible to humans. Our work has been accepted by ICC2023.
And then, we propose SemGuard: A Unified Framework for Semantic Protection in Deep Learning-based Semantic Communication Systems. Our work was submitted to Communication Magazine.

- 2023.03-Now Graph Data Mining and Machine Learning Lab (GAMMA Lab)

  - Interest: Data Mining and GNN (Mentor: Prof. Chuan Shi)

  - Duty: I study GNN and graph data mining.
I do research and coding for papers in the CCF-A conference of GNN model.
