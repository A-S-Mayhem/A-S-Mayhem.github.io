# Research experience

I have more than ten years of research experience in Statistics. In 2013, after graduating, I worked with Prof. Dang Duc Trong to study the application of nonparametric regression techniques for solving the backward heat problems with statistical discrete data. In 2015 and 2018, I and Prof. Duc Trong Dang, together with other colleagues, published two papers on mathematical and statistical journals.
<br><br>
In 2014, I was selected as a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the Department of Statistical Sciences with the first rank in the ranking list of CARIPARO Ph.D. scholarship at the University of Padova, Italy. During three years of my Ph.D. program, I was working on the subject "Statistical evaluation of diagnostic tests under verification bias"s which is an interested topic in Medical Statistics. In particular, I and my supervisors (Prof. Monica Chiogna and Prof. Gianfranco Adimari) have investigated several methods, both parametric and nonparametric, to correct for verification bias in the evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy when the disease status has three categories (e.g., non-diseased, intermediate, diseased). For illustration, we applied our proposed methods to evaluate the accuracy of ovarian cancer-related tumor marker CA125 (which is a highly glycosylated sialomucin that is expressed on epithelial cell surface, especially on ovarian cancer cells) and to evaluate the ability of cerebrospinal fluid tau protein to discriminate between cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I developed an R package (named bcROCsurface) and a web interface (ShinyApps) to support researchers in the evaluation of predictive ability of diagnostic tests. As a result, I was awarded the Prize for Research 2017 of the department.
<br><br>
From May 2017 to April 2018, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the department for the project "Likelihood approaches for multivariate meta-analysis in situations with possible problems of measurements errors and missing data" under the advice of Prof. Annamaria Guolo. We developed a pseudo-likelihood approach for multivariate meta-analysis of test accuracy studies with multiple thresholds. This method is based on the ideas of composite likelihood approach and multivariate mixed-effect model. Our proposed method is applied to two real meta-analyses on the accuracy of diagnostic tests to detect significant proteinuria from pre-eclampsia of pregnancies and to identify type 2 diabetes mellitus.
<br><br>
From November 2018 to December 2020, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the department for my proposed research project "ROC analysis for complex data". The project has been funded within the Project of Excellence "Statistical methods and models for complex data" of the department, from 2018 to 2020. Within this project, I studied some improvement for estimation of the volume under the ROC surface under nonignorable missing data mechanism, and methods to estimate the ROC surface and the volume under the ROC surface with clustered data also in the presence of covariates.
<br><br>
From 2020 to 2022, I proposed a research project entitled "Advanced methods for the evaluation of diagnostic tests with complex data". The project has been funded within the Project of Excellence "Statistical methods and models for complex data" of the department. Within this project, I focus on some of these non-standard or complex situations and, in particular, aims to tackle and solve some open questions in the context of ROC analysis with clustered data, covariate effects and optimal use of diagnostic test or biomarker. For clustered data, I and my colleagues (Prof. Monica Chiogna and Prof. Gianfranco Adimari) proposed some new estimation processes for finding the optimal thresholds of a diagnostic test (biomarker), underlying the linear mixed-effects models. As an application, we study the use of the *Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein Family Member 5* gene expression as a biomarker to distinguish among three types of glutamatergic neurons, namely Layer 2/3 Intratelencephalic (L2/3 IT), Layer 4 (L4) and Layer 5 Pyramidal Tract (L5 PT) neurons. In addition, I developed an R package, named ClusROC, to support researches in the evaluation of predictive ability of classifiers (diagnostic tests or biomarkers) with clustered data. With regards to problem of covariate effects to diagnostic test accuracy, we proposed a new method to adjust for covariate effects in the estimation of volume under a ROC surface (VUS). The method is based on the induced-regression methodology, and the estimation can be done by a semiparametric generalized estimating equations (GEE) or by local linear regression (LL). We applied this method to the study of the effect of age on the ability of three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, namely Aβ1-42 (amyloid-β1-42), Tau (total tau) protein and pTau (phosphorylated tau) protein, to distinguish the stages of Alzheimer’s disease, i.e., cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
<br><br>
I also collaborated with some colleagues, biomedical engineers (Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova), to study some topics within the project "Movement Biomechanics in Parkinson's Disease". 
<br><br>
Currently, I am studying the application of empirical likelihood-based inference for ROC analysis.
