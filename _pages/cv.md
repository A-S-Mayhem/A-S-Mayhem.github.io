Undergraduate Research Experience
======
* ***Detection of luxRI homologs in Aeromonas bacteria (Fall 2013)***
  - National Centre for Cell Science Pune, India
  - Advisors: Kamlesh Jangid, PhD & Yogesh Shouche, PhD
  - Project Description: Confirmed the presence of virulence-associated luxRI homologs in 27 environmental isolates of Aeromonas bacteria
using PCR and a biosensor assay
