<h1 style="text-align: left;">Ricardo Szczerbacki</h1>

I am a PhD student in the Computer Vision Group at the University of Sheffield, where I began my studies in April 2024. My research interests include Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Computer Graphics, and Scientific Computing.

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Computer Graphics, from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Brazil.

I also work as a Computer Scientist at Petrobras. My PhD is fully sponsored by the company, allowing me to dedicate full time to my research.
