Education
======
* 2020-Current: Bocconi University (Italy), PhD in Statistics and Computer Science
* 2018-2020: Bocconi University (Italy), M.Sc. in Business Analytics and Data Science
	* Grade: 110/110 “Cum Laude”
	* Research Thesis on “Bayesian cross-validation and Importance Sampling”
	* Supported research during BIDSA student's initiative, a honours program. The projected concerned studying the energy of the solution landscape of MLP and assessing the possibility of leveraging local algorithms to retrain individual perceptrons to obtain better out-of-sample performance. 
* 2015-2018: Università degli studi di Milano (Italy), B.Sc. in Mathematics
	* Grade: 110/110 “Cum Laude”
	* Thesis on “Multiple integration for non-injective Lipshitz functions”


Work experience
======
* June 2019-October 2019: Junior Data Analyst ad MDOTM
	* Implemented a Factor Investing strategy on a Java interface based on a comprehensive literature review on the topic 
	* Collaborated in the implementation and performance analysis of a Neural Network for stock return prediction. In particular I focused on the optimisation of computations and analysis of the out-of-sample perfomance.
	* Implemented a dynamical plotting framework in Python to analyse results of different experiments. The framework was build on the libraries "ipywidgets" and "qgrid"
* February 2019-June 2019: Part time job as Junior Data analyst at Rationis
	* Implemented an optimisation algorithm for portfolio allocation with customisable micro and macro economic constraints, which required to combine convex optimisation with mixed integer programming
