Experiences
======
### [Fudan Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.fudan.edu.cn) (FudanNLP), Fudan University

Research Assistant, supervised by [*Prof. Xipeng Qiu*](http://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/xpqiu)

* Worked on the multi-task learning framework to jointly learn across multiple related tasks.
* Participated in developing three mechanisms of sharing information to model text with task-specific and
shared layers based on recurrent neural network.

### [Intelligent Networking systems & Future Internet Infrastructure Lab](http://www.zuqingzhu.info) (INFINITE), University of Science and Technology of China

Research Assistant, supervised by [*Prof. Zuqing Zhu*](http://www.zuqingzhu.info)

_Project: Design of Restoration Schemes for OTN Encryption Architecture_

* Addressed the security vulnerabilities in three encryption network architectures deployed in optical transport network, and introduced multi-layer restoration as security protection solution.
* Proposed a multi-layer restoration scheme and an auxiliary-graph algorithm to improve the cost effectiveness based on operational expense, and implemented numerical simulations in NSFNET topology.


*Project: Research on Dynamic Failure Recovery Scheme in Multi-layer Elastic Optical Networks (EONs)*

* Applied co-degradation of QoS, demand classification and dynamic routing to recover affected traffic flows affected by outages in heavily loaded multi-layer EONs.
* Proposed a mixed-integer linear programming model to formulate broken virtual mapping topology.
* Designed a heuristic algorithm, based on MCMF algorithm, dynamic programming algorithm and
classified co-degradation algorithm, to solve the NP-hard problem of MILP model.
* Launched simulations in eight-node EON and achieved respectively 56% and 68% performance improve- ment in terms of degradation penalty and decline of blocking probability compared with existing recovery strategies.

*Project: Design of Flexible Service Provisioning in IP over EONs*

* Addressed the problems of the existing studies assuming the network service provisioning managed in a entirely centralized manner.
* Formulated a stackelberg game in which the service operator is the leader and incoming requests are the followers.
* Analyzed the existence of Stackelberg Equilibriums in the single-logic-link and multiple-logic-links scenarios.

### Undergraduate Research Program, Northwestern Polytechnical University

Research Assistant, supervised by [*Prof. Ruonan Zhang*](http://dianzi.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1270/5979.htm)

* Addressed the issue to de-embed the antenna effect from captured channel profiles for the wideband sounding.
* Proposed a convolutional modeling approach to express a synthesized spatial channel response, and designed a two-step antenna de-embedding algorithm to de-embed the antenna effect and mitigate the system noise.
* Proposed another de-embedding algorithm for mmWare channel measurement based on Tikhonove regularization.
* Analyzed the measured channel response and obtained result of sparse impulse propagation model by computing data at frequencies of 73GHz and 73.4GHz, and achieved the correlation coefficient reaching more than 95%.
