Research Experience
======
* Lab Technician, TAMU, *2017*
  * Responsible for conducting all daily operations including list preparation, seed prep, seed sowing, marker sampling, planting, fertilizing, IPM, trellising, pruning, pollination, evaluation, seed harvest, seed classification and seed shipping, to achieve short term and lovegetable breeding goals in seven greenhouses and acre sized field. 
  * Conducted greenhouse and field trial of grafted tomato project to study the yield performance of different rootstock and scion combination in RCBD design. 
  * Assisted in screening peppers for bacterial leaf spot resistance and thrip resistance in the field and hybrid testing in different locations.
  * Assisted in screening tomatoes for whitefly resistance.
  * Crossed pepper, tomato, melon and squash to produce hybrid seed. 
  * Set up and maintained irrigation system in the field and greenhouses. 
  * Supervised a crew of undergraduate student workers and trained graduate student workers.
  * Maintained an orderly and efficient breeding laboratory, including carrying out bench work protocols, record-keeping and ordering supplies and equipment, etc.
  * Prepared documents and manuscripts for conference presentation, publication and germplasm release. 
* Graduate Research Assistant, TAMU, *2014-2016*
  * Developing SNP markers for shoot and root traits in an F2 population derived from Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum cheesmaniae using GBS (Genotype by Sequencing).
  * Measured the root morphological traits using WinRhizo software.
  * Analyzed phenotypic data (ANOVA, Correlation, Heritability and PCA) in JMP and R.
  * Extracted, purified and quantified tomato DNA for constructing GBS template.
  * Constructed linkage map for mapping population using R/qtl, ASMap and Joinmap4.1
  * Conducted QTL analysis of phenotypic traits using R/qtl, WinQTLCartographer, MapQTL and QTLNetworks softwares.
  * Successfully developed SNP markers for screening root biomass and specific root length traits in tomato.
  * Received bioinformatics courses training on analyzing next-gen sequencing data by using R and Linux, including sequence alignment, genome annotation, assembly, and SNP calling, etc.
* Undergraduate Reseach Assistant, Biomass Engeering Center, CAU, *2012-2014*
  * Conducted an anaerobic reactor biogas production project to study the effect of co-digesting sweet potato vines with dairy manure in different ratios on methane production.
    * Measured the TVFA (total volatile fat acid) by using HPLC and S-COD (soluble chemical oxygen demand), TS (total solids) and VS (volatile solids) of effluent every other three day
    * Monitored the methane content daily by using gas chromatography.
    * Received training on PCR, DGGE, AGE, and DNA extraction of soil samples.
  * Assisted in studying the effects of four different media (husk, rice straw, mixed husk and rice) on rice growth.
    * Measured the content of nitrogen in the media and the morphological and physiological index of rice.
    * Managed the greenhouse for rice growth.
