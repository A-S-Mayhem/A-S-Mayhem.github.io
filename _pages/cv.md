Work experience
======
* June 2021 - March 2022: Administrative Staff
  * Korea University, Sejong, Korea
  * Duties included: Admission Data Analysis, General Administration;
  I worked as an administrative staff member of the admissions team at Korea University. I was in charge of data analysis regarding university admission, including processing of students' school record data (over 20,000 students per year) and computing the scores to be used for making decisions about admission. The data I processed included Korean students' scores and grades, their attendance, and teachers’ written evaluations of students’ performance. These types of data were interconnected and needed to be correlated with each segment of the decision-making process. As such, I wrote a comprehensive SAS code to handle the volume and processing of this information. I also managed a database using SQL and Oracle that I used to notify students about their admission results via the admissions team website. I also supported admissions interviews, practical tests, and written tests (mainly the math section). Finally, I presented information and consulting sessions in high schools and at regional admissions fairs.

I was mainly in charge of flagging candidates’ applications for key words in written data that warranted further review. I analyzed admission results and survey responses with SPSS and R.provided statistical support in analyzing survey data gathered from teachers and admission officers for the research project.
