    * Performed Locust load testing and performance analytics & reporting in python.
  * **Big Data / Machine Learning Engineer**, Fortune 100 Financial Services Company
    * Played a critical role on a team of data scientists to develop a risk modeling score using a dynamic penalty function to grade each business application by cyber risk by summarizing over 170 metrics across 4 domains.
    * Formulated a penalty function, worked with subject matter experts (SMEs) to own the “Resiliency” domain within cyber risk, and developed and productionized the model in Python and SQL on AWS.

* **Data Science Implementation Intern**, Nationwide Insurance
  * Columbus, Ohio, May 2019 - Dec. 2019
  * Developed and deployed a performance monitoring system for all predictive models in the Predictive Analytics Department so both audit and data science leadership can understand how models change over time.

  * Prepared and deployed other predictive models into production with IBM’s SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services.
  * Environment:  Teradata, Linux, Django, Python, R, Shell, Tableau, Postgre SQL Server.


* **Data Science Capstone Project**, NetJets						   
  * Columbus, Ohio, Aug. 2019 - Dec. 2019
  * Lead a group of three to develop a predictive model to estimate the probability of an unscheduled maintenance event occurring on a specific jet the next day, based on 2019 YTD data.
  * Challenges included relating maintenance events to recent flights (no join keys) and imbalanced dataset.
  * Concluded with a random forest model with a Type I (overly conservative) error rate of ~40% and Type II error rate of 2-5%.  The models applied to 47% of the fleet and a conservative 1% reduction in total unexpected maintenance events translates to $1.7 million in savings YoY.
