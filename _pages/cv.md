Research Experience
======
* October, 2020 - Present: Research intern
  * Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications
  * Duties included: Research, implementation, experiment, analysis
  * Currently exploring new areas of mobile systems. More information will be updated after the work is published.
  * Explored intelligent scheduling based on  big.LITTLE cores. This work hopes to achieve intelligent scheduling of tasks on big.LITTLE cores through reinforcement learning, so as to reduce energy consumption as much as possible while ensuring quality of service.
  * Explored the fast wake-up camera based on single-chip microcomputer. This work hopes that by asynchronously starting the necessary modules and executing the user program loaded into the kernel mode, the energy-constrained edge camera can use less working time and energy to complete the image sampling and processing.
  * Advisor: [Mengwei Xu](https://xumengwei.github.io/)
* November, 2019 - September, 2020: Research intern
  * Peking University
  * Duties included: Research, implementation, experiment, analysis
  * Explored indoor tracking of moving targets based on IR-UWB devices. This work hopes to improve the accuracy and robustness of indoor moving target tracking by improving the background signal elimination algorithm, target extraction algorithm and positioning algorithm, and provides a foundation for future multi-target tracking and higher-level human perception. Techniques used include finite impulse response, background signal elimination, Gaussianb blur, target extraction, outlier handling, three-point positioning.
  * Publication: "Multi-view fusion based moving target tracking using IR-UWB devices"
  * Advisor: [Daqing Zhang](http://www-public.tem-tsp.eu/~zhang_da/DaqingZhang.html)
