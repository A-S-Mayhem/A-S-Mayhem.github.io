## Research Overview

My major research uses advanced statistical, network and computational methods ("big data" technique) to study social, economic, and political outcomes of social movements. My dissertation examines how social movements shape corporate activities and corresponding social inequality (e.g., wage inequality). I investigate how financialization of firms and unions mediates or moderates the influence of social movements (e.g., labor strikes) on labor market outcomes. My ongoing research agenda focuses on other aspects related to social movement dynamics, this can be seen in my published and in-progress work described below.

My research recently published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12419/full) (2017) examines how the sexual revolution movements in China since 1980 have shaped the life-course of individuals in China.  The topic of this research specifically focused on the emerging trend of cohabitation in contemporary China, which carries important consequences for how family life is structured in the country. Following feminist movements in the Western world, the sexual revolution movement in China successfully lobbied for non-traditional ideals regarding family-life and effectively reshaped the subjective meaning of intimate relationships for younger individuals. Additional work in progress goes further to explore how these subjective meanings were transformed in recent years.

A second line of research relating to the consequences of social movements examines school racial-based segregation in the United States from 1952 to 2013. School segregation can be understood in light of movement-countermovement dynamics that reflect the development of the U.S. civil rights movement and the subsequent reactionary responses to it. This work recently published in [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9) (2017) with [Jeremy Fiel](https://jeremyefiel.com/school-segregation) uses APC methods to first investigate the trend of school desegregation or resegregation in the post-civil rights era. I am also excited for an ongoing follow-up project with Jeremy Fiel that examines the reversal of school desegregation policies. We find that dismantling school desegregation is a dual process that both national elites and local actors contribute to the end (continuation) of court supervision.

While the previously mentioned paper explores the consequences of movements, other research I am involved with reverses the causal arrow, exploring ways that political and social contexts shape social movement behavior. Work with Andrew P. Davis that has been resubmitted to the International Journal of Comparative Sociology uses fixed effects statistical models across 174 countries from 1970-2006 to explore the extent to which a nation’s level of civil society openness is related to levels of radical social movement activity, in this case terrorism. Other work with my colleagues Alexander Kinney and Andrew P. Davis at Arizona uses computational methods (Latent Direchlet allocation – topic modeling) to explore how terrorist organizations theme or adorn themselves strategically to differentiate themselves from one another to appeal to potential recruits, even while fitting broadly under the niche-category “Islamic terrorist organization.” This research has been resubmitted to Poetics.
