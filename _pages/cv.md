## WORK/RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
<!-- ====== -->

* **AI Engineer / Developing an influenza diagnosis method from pharyngeal images using deep learning**, Oct 2019 --- Present
  * [Aillis, Inc.](https://www.aillis.jp/) (Startup company), Tokyo, Japan
  * As a key developer and researcher on the AI team, I led the AI team from prototyping to commercialization of influenza diagnosing AI in a startup company. Through working closely with physicians, hardware team, and software/AI team as a collaborative research project, the project was successfully completed from prototyping to clinical trial in a short period.
  * The influenza diagnosing AI predicts influenza infection from pharyngeal images and clinical information using multi-modal deep learning. I proposed and developed a number of significant methods and integrated the ideas into the multi-modal medical AI for the clinical trial.
  * Our collaborative team conducted a clinical trial and the medical AI system received [pharmaceutical approval](ttps://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000014.000035813.html) in Japan in April 2022. This is the first time a prospective study of an AI medical device has been conducted in Japan. For reference, only four products among the 130 AI medical devices are approved by the U.S. FDA as of April 2022.
  * I developed the AI model using the supercomputer [ABCI](https://abci.ai/) from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. This supercomputer has a world-leading computational processing power of 550 AI-PFLOPS with 4,352 NVIDIA V100 GPUs.
* **Software Engineering Intern / Developed a console device to collect influenza patient data**, Jul 2019 --- Oct 2019
  * [Aillis, Inc.](https://www.aillis.jp/) (Startup company), Tokyo, Japan
  * I led the data collection stage as a developer for developing the influenza diagnosis AI. I mainly developed a console device to collect patient data in medical institutions for clinical research in Japan.
  * With the device I developed, clinical research is conducted in Japan in 2019 and more than 10,000 patients and 500,000 pharyngeal images are collected from about 100 medical institutions to build a unique pharyngeal database.
* **AI Engineering Intern / Sleep stage classification from EEG signal using deep learning**, Apr 2019 --- Jul 2019
  * [PGV Inc.](https://www.pgv.co.jp/en/) (Startup company) Tokyo, Japan
  * I supported developing sleep stage classification AI models from EEG signals and surrounding software.
* **Leading Position of Research Team / Aircraft Design using multi-objective Bayesian optimization** Apr 2015 --- Mar 2019
  * Conducted the research on multi-objective Bayesian optimization for composite aircraft design under the supervision of Professor Okabe (research topic of bachelor and master theses). I led the collaborative research with Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Toray Industries, and three aerospace engineering laboratories.
  * To create the automated aircraft design method, the Genetic Algorithm, multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian process ([see also my personal project](https://github.com/MasashiSode/MOBO)), Finite Element Method (FEM, written in C lang), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD, written in Fortran), and the fluid-structure interaction method are integrated into a Python library with a high-performance computation environment in Linux.
