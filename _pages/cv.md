Research Experience
======

* Independent Study, Jan 2020 - Apr 2021 
  * Supervised by Professor [Kerby Shedden](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/people/faculty/kshedden.html), Department of Statistics, University of Michigan
  * Honors Thesis (awarded High Honors): [Local False Discovery Rates in the Multi-Parameter Case, with Application to Epigenetics of Human Growth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14tf0MGQ4rOotmwVfcAnDwLZA7WaObCmI/view)


* Research Assistant, Sep 2019 - Apr 2021
  * Supervised by Professor [Oliver He](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/dcmb/yongqun-oliver-he-phd), University of Michigan Medical School
  * (Link to Pubmed)

* Independent Study, May 2019 - Sep 2020
  * Supervised by Professor [Annette Ostling](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/faculty/aostling.html), Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 
  * Wrote code to establish mathematical modeling with the aim of testing the neutral theory, applying the approach earlier developed by the lab in small landscapes. Performed the method of predicting abundances on actual data gathered from BCI(Barro Colorado Island) and analyzed the association between the results of the simulations and traits as well as the habitat patterns of the species.
