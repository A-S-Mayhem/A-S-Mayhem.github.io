Education
======
* MS Robotics, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor (expected 2025)
* BE Information Technology, University of Mumbai (2023)

Experience
======
* Invideo, <em>Software Engineer Intern</em>
  * Implemented NeRF models to generate realistic talking head avatars from a single image + text script/driving audio.
  * Deployed the service as an API on Modal Labs cloud-compute as part of invideo's AI suite.
  * Developed an AI Playground app for collectively deploying open-source models.

* Indian Institute of Science (IISc Bangalore), <em>Research Intern</em>
  * ‘Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation of Indian Road Scenes’ for applications in autonomous driving and navigation systems.
  * Supervisor: Dr. KVS Hari

* Nucsoft, <em>Software Engineer Intern</em>
  * Created an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool for masking sensitive data on government documents.
  * Trained and deployed the model to redact the ID numbers on Aadhaar cards (similar to Social Security numbers in the US).

* Mavericks Racing, <em>Autonomous Driving Domain Head</em>
  * Implemented models for monocular depth estimation, video-frame interpolation, and video super-resolution.
  * Trained a DQN agent in CarRacing 2D, an autonomous vehicle environment in OpenAI Gym.
 
* JSW Steel, <em>Research Intern</em>
  * Led a 6-member team in building predictive models to determine the mechanical properties of steel wire rods by analyzing the thermal variance during the manufacturing process.
