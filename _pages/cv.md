I work at the intersection of multimodal transportation, network modeling, and environmental health. My research centers on understanding the complex dynamics in multimodal transportation networks, the health implications of cumulative thermal exposure of travelers, and building a cyber-physical infrastructure to enhance safety and accessibility of travelers. My research has been published in high-impact journals, such as Sustainable Cities and Society, and has earned me competitive grants and awards, totaling over CAD\$300,000. As an educator, I serve as instructor and co-instructor of record for three courses, integrating my interdisciplinary research background into the classroom, highlighting an inclusive learning environment. My academic trajectory underscores my commitment to enhancing transportation sustainability and equity.
