Undergraduate Research Experience
======

* Detection of luxRI homologs in Aeromonas bacteria (Fall 2013)
  - National Centre for Cell Science Pune, India
  - Advisors: Kamlesh Jangid, PhD & Yogesh Shouche, PhD
  - Project Description: Confirmed the presence of virulence-associated luxRI homologs in 27 environmental isolates of Aeromonas bacteria
using PCR and a biosensor assay

* Efficacy Testing of Disinfectants on MS2 Phage at Different Concentrations and Contact Times (Summer 2013)
  - Tata Research Design and Development Centre (Process Engineering Lab) Pune, India
  - Advisors: Chetan Malhotra, PhD & Rajshree Patil, PhD
  - Project Description: Determined the minimum exposure times and concentrations at which candidate disinfectants are most effective
against a model virus and hence most suitable for use in a low-cost water purification system under development in the lab
