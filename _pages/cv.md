## Projects
* A complete SW/HW co-design system for mask detection SoC 
  * SoC consists of: pipelined RV32I core, I-cache/D-cache, AXI bus, DMA, DRAM/ROM controller, Interrupt manager, and CNN acceleration unit.
  * Apply network compression and quantization on mask detection NN model.
  * Inference the compressed model on a SoC with HW acceleration.
  * SoC handles the booting sequence, data movements, the control of acceleration unit, and system interrupts.
