Projects
======
* <a href="https://github.com/hmmartiny/Predicting-Gene-Expression" target="_blank">Deep protein representations enable recombinant protein expression</a> (2019-2021): Originally my Master thesis project, where the goal was to predict recombinant gene expression using deep learning methods. After I finished in 2019, we wrote the findings into a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.13.443426v1.full#fn-1" target="_blank">paper that is currently out on bioRxiv</a>.
* <a href="https://github.com/mari756h/The_unemployed_cells" targeT="_blank">The Language of Life</a> (2018-2019): applying deep learning methods to predict amino acids in protein sequences.
  * Project originally started as part of the course 02456 Deep Learning at DTU
  * Applied Word2Vec and CNNs to protein sequence data
  * Supervisors: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jj-almagro-armenteros/" targeT="_blank">Jose Juan Almagro Armenteros</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexrosejo" targeT="_blank">Alexander Rosenberg Johansen</a>
* <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark">iGEM 2018: Hyphae Hackers, DTU Biobuilders.</a>
  * Participiated in 2018 as part of the team at Technical University of Denmark
  * Project investigated how we can use mycelium from fungi as building materials
    * My work can be seen in the <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/GrowthModelling" targeT="_blank">modelling of hyphal growth</a>, and was part of the design team for the webpage.
* <a href="https://github.com/hmmartiny/Microbesoft" targeT="_blank">Microbesoft</a> (2018): a command-line tool to visualize alignment files.
  * Project built as part of participiating in Copenhacks 2018, a hackathon held in Copenhagen for students.
  * Won 2nd place

Hobbies
======
I do like to draw and paint in my spare time, but more recently I have taken up crochet - a good way to keep my supplies of dish cloths up to date.. I sometimes post my art at Instagram under the user <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hmmartiny/" targeT="_blank">hmmartiny</a>.
