## Education

**Columbia University**, B.S. in Biomedical Engineering (2013)   
**Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, PhD in Biological Engineering (expected 2019)

## Research experience

**Alm lab**, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2014-present)   
*Under the direction of Eric Alm*

I am currently a PhD student in [Eric Alm's lab](almlab.mit.edu) at MIT. You cn learn more about my research interests on our [lab website](http://almlab.mit.edu/claire_duvallet.html) and on my [publications](/publications/) and [research](/research/) pages.

**Molecular and Microscale Bioenigneering Laboratory**, Columbia University (2011-2013)
*Under the direction of Samuel K. Sia*

I was an undergraduate research assistant in [Sam   Sia](http://bme.columbia.edu/samuel-k-sia)'s lab for two years at Columbia.
There, I worked on developing a point-of-care microfluidic device to diagnose multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.
I primarily worked on the DNA amplification and detection modules, optimizing primers and reaction conditions off-chip.

**Laboratoire de Biochimie**, Ecole Polytechnique (Summer 2012)   
*Under the direction of Cedric Norais*

I was an International Undergraduate Research Intern at Ecole Polytechnique the summer before my senior year.
There, I worked with Cedric Norais to study the acquired-immunity CRISPR system in E. coli.
