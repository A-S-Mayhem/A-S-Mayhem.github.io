Education
======
* B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, University of Houston, 2017
* Ph.D in Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, 2023 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Technical Services Analyst - Epic Systems
  * Served as liaison between health care professionals and Epic developers to ensure software solutions effectively addressed client needs
  * Debugged, maintained, and contributed to EMR codebase using MUMPS language and Chronicles database
  * Optimized system searches to drastically reduce run times and modified existing reporting models, using SQL, to support new healthcare reporting initiatives

* Undergraduate Research Assistant - Center for Theoretical Biological Physics, Rice University
  * Computationally and mathematically explored the areas of nonlinear dynamics and stochastic processes 
  * Developed a computational model to understand the collective behavior and synchronization in a system of cells with quorum sensing
  * Numerical schemes, data analysis, and creative graphical visualizations were developed and conducted in MATLAB and Python
  * Supervisor: Dr. Herbert Levine, Dr. Stuart Sevier
  
  * Lab Instructor / Teaching Assistant - Computing for Engineers, University of Houston
    * Instructed a first-year computing course in mathematical programming, heavily relying on MATLAB and briefly instructing in VBA/Excel
    * Topics covered ranged from programming basics to probability, statistics, and plotting
    * Held office hours, conducted exam reviews, and provided one-on-one tutoring
  
  * Undergraduate Research Assistant - Nanothermlab, University of Houston
    * Developed a slippery, anti-icing surface, known as MAGSS, leveraging the magnetic properties of ferrofluid and its moleculary smooth surface 
    * Studied the extent of MAGSS' slipperiness by manipulating droplets on the surface through temperature gradients
    * Developed a flexible, porous structure that allows for efficient solar-steam generation through heat localization
    * Studied the potential of graphene for membrane-based water desalination through flake deposition onto micro-porous membranes
    * Supervisor: Dr. Hadi Ghasemi
