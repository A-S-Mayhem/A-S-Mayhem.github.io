## Experience

## [Cervest](https://cervest.earth/)
**Senior Data Scientist** <br/> 
*Oct 2021 – June 2023*

* Lead the technical implementation of a global in-house digital terrain model for flooding applications, empowered by the fusion of multiple remote-sensing satellite data with a DL model and provided support as ML Subject Matter Expert to other workstreams, such as wildfire.
* Support company planning about the identification of new opportunities where ML can boost our climate science by providing additional business value (i.e., Computational performance, spatiotemporal resolution, etc.)
* Coordinated team of up to 4 members across the different stages of the product implementation: prototyping, scaling, and deployment.

## [GMV](https://www.gmv.com/en-es)
**Machine Learning Engineer** <br/> 
*Sept 2019 – Oct 2021*

* Worked with large datasets such as satellite multispectral imagery datasets (Sentinel 2, GOES, GPM Constellations), GNSS Datasets, and 3D Point Cloud LIDAR Data.
* Participated in the preparation of technical proposals for different organizations (ESA, EC): perform trade-off analysis of technical solutions, drafting of the system requirements, and Architecture Diagrams.
* The project portfolio included EO applications, GNSS Systems, Weather Nowcasting, and Smart Railway Gauging




## Education

### Imperial College London
**MSc Advanced Computational Methods for Aeronautics, Flow Management, and Fluid-Structure Interaction** <br/>
*Sept 2018 – Sept 2019*

Thesis: “Analysis of the Turbulent /Non- Turbulent Interface of the Axisymmetric Turbulent Wakes generated by a Fractal and a Square Plate”. Received training and used the UK HPC Supercomputer, ARCHER, and the research high-order flow solver, Incompact3d, to conduct the simulation.
