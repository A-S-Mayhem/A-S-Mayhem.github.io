# Research experience

I have more than seven years of research experience in Statistics. In 2013, after graduating, I worked with Prof. Duc Trong Dang to study the application of nonparametric regression techniques for solving the backward heat problems with statistical discrete data. In 2015 and 2018, I and Prof. Duc Trong Dang, together with other colleagues, published two papers on mathematical and statistical journals.
