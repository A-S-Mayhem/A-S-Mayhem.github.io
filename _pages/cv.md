Industrial experience
======
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Proscia Inc. ( December 2018 - May 2020 )_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Research Engineer**
- Developed and validated a real-world deep learning pathology software system
using techniques like multiple instance learning, confidence thresholding to enable
faster diagnosis of skin cancer
- Developed tools for image classification, stain normalization and image
segmentation for digital pathology software systems using deep learning.
- Performed Scientific experiments including literature survey, hypothesis testing, and implementation of ideas in the perspective of Prosciaâ€™s product goals.
- Led the development work associated with different modules in a project.
- Co-authored academic papers showcasing validation results, novel machine learning algorithms, and techniques, and clinical studies of the product.
- Stayed up-to-date with scientific literature and best practices in the field.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_nView Medical ( August 2017 - November 2018 )_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Medical Imaging Scientist**
- Developed deep learning infrastructure to improve the quality of 3D tomographic
medical images.
- Low latency tomographic imaging reconstruction system and method based on
compressed data, multi-scale data representation, and computation. This method
allows for real-time reconstruction over the cloud.
- Developed, profiled and optimized image reconstruction software for a medical
imaging device that generates near real-time 3D reconstructions using cone-beam
tomosynthesis fluoroscopy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Honeywell Technology Solutions Lab ( June 2013 - July 2015 )_    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Software Developer**
- Developed a tool for automating graphics testing for cockpit displays. The tool uses
an image comparison algorithm to compare images in the requirement to the
images produced during execution of the software. The tool eliminates the effort 
required to manually execute the test scripts, saving money, time and effort. A
patent has been filed for the same.
- Developed a tool to extract features of the cockpit display. The tool automatically
generates test scripts based on the requirements, executes the file on the
simulation environment and generates results. A patent has been filed for the
same.
- Developed a tool to generate test cases from model based requirements. The tool
uses MATLAB to query the models, generates the code files for the models using
HAM library. The tool also generates test cases for the model in a csv format.
Another tool has further been developed to extract the test cases from the csv file
into the format suitable for the execution environment (VB scripts, cpp scripts,
python scripts).
- Analyzed, developed and implemented optimization techniques to reduce the cycle
time for testing for the rehosting of software for EASE(Honeywell flight simulation
environment)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Bhabha Atomic Research Center ( June 2012 - September 2012 )_    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Software Developer Intern**
- Developed an algorithm for cross a compiler for arm pc and software postbox using
socket programming

Academic Projects
======
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_University of Utah_  
- Predicting an airline's stock price based on on-time performance and twitter sentiment analysis
- A Convex Framework for Fair Regression
  - Proposing a convex family of fairness regularizers of varying strength that spans the spectrum from group to
        individual fairness.
  - Performing an empirical comparative study across numerous fairness-sensitive data sets to assess the price of
        fairness using the proposed fairness regularizers. 
- Approximation guarantees for subspace clustering in the spirit of algorithms for k-means.
