  <details><summary>Bio</summary><p>I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I was also a GPEP predoctoral fellow at Georgetown University's Mortara Center for International Studies for the 2020-2021 academic year. My research focuses on the politics of foreign direct investment and trade, and business-government relations. My dissertation book project investigates why and how foreign direct investment into weak institutional environments achieve property protection through host government institutions, especially in terms of technology assets. The paper version of my dissertation is a finalist for the GWU-CIBER Best Paper on Emerging Markets Award.</p>

  <details><summary>Bio</summary><p>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Cornell University. My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and international relations. It examines how attitudes towards international affairs shape and are shaped by processes of political contestation at the domestic level. In my dissertation project, I explore how populist radical right parties can unintentionally drive support for international economic integration among Western European publics when they engage in extremist rhetoric. I use a wide range of methods in my research, including machine learning, quantitative text analysis, survey experiments, elite interviews, and quasi-experimental research designs.</p>

  <details><summary>Bio</summary><p>I am a PhD student from the Department of Government at the University of Essex (UK). I am interested in the construction, enforcement and effects of state-based and international institutions that regulate multinational firms.
<br />
In my PhD thesis I focus on the multilateral cooperation to regulate corporate foreign bribery. I seek to explain variations in state capacity to hold corporations accountable for exporting corruption abroad. I approach my study employing quantitative methods, and bringing together insights from the literature on international institutions and on political-economic determinants of firms' behaviors.</p>
