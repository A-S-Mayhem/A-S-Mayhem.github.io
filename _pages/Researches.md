Intelligent quality detection of lane rendering data	         Aug.2022- Sept.2022 
======
* Objective: To efficiently detect whether there are defects in the rendered generated map data for navigation
* Implemented pre-training with Masked Image Modeling using three hybrid CNN-LSTM neural network models
* Build the pre-training pipeline for the image recovery task and carried out the pre-training
* Tested different numbers of continuous sequence image inputs with different pre-training models
* Adjusted the pre-trained models for fine-tuning the image classification task
* Developed the pipeline for abnormal image detection to identify defected lane rendering image
* Delivery: An implementation report and participated in the HUAWEI 2022 Global AI Challenge
