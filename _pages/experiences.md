{% include base_path %}

I was born in the historic and charming city of Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. Today, I am pursuing my undergraduate studies at the prestigious Peking University, where I am majoring in Intelligence and Technology. My life is not solely consumed by academia, though; I have a keen interest in a variety of sports and e-sports. Particularly, I am an enthusiastic pool player, and I enjoy watching snooker games. In my free time, I often play Chinese 8-ball with friends.

I am also an ethicist in the realm of gaming, engaging with both online multiplayer and single-player games. My love for photography is another passion, and I aspire to become a travel influencer and vlogger, sharing my adventures online.

My high school years were marked by a profound love for mathematics, which led me to win a Provincial First Prize in the National Mathematics Competition. However, as I progressed through university, I realized that my true passion lies at the crossroads of theoretical knowledge and practical application. Currently, I am dedicated to enhancing our comprehension of AI models, convinced that this is the pathway to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This drive fuels my ambition to pursue a Ph.D. and to become a researcher in the dynamic field of AI.
