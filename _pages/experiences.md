I was born in Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, a lovely city with a long and rich history. Currently, I am a student at Peking University, majoring in Intelligence and Technology. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid pool enthusiast and enjoy playing pool in my spare time. I am also a fan of the NBA and enjoy watching basketball games.

Back in high school, I was a huge fan of mathematics and won a Provincial First Prize in the National Mathematics Competition. However, during my time at university, I discovered that my true interest lies at the intersection of theory and practice. I am now focusing on advancing our understanding of AI models. This passion drives my aspiration to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science and become a researcher in the field of AI.
