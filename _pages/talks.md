## Stacking and Balancing Casual Causality

>**Abstract**: In recent years, causality has emerged as a powerful criterion to distinguish between effective field theories (EFTs) arising from physical and unphysical high-energy theories. 
>
>A direct way to ensure a given EFT is causal is to demand a lower bound on scattering time delays. In flat space, this is unambiguously dictated by the Minkowski light cones, but the situation is more subtle with dynamical gravity. I will make the case that the relevant notion is so-called infrared (IR) causality. 
>
>As an example, I will apply this to study Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $D \geq 5$. For graviton scattering in spherical symmetry, IR causality is satisfied as long as the coupling is order unity. I will emphasise that it is not possible to find sharper bounds by scattering off multiple sources while staying within the regimes of the eikonal, semiclassical, and Born approximations and the EFT itself.
