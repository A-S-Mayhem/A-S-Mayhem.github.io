## Talks

### The Intrinsic Manifolds of Radiological Images and their Role in Deep Learning *(October 2022)*
For The Pacific Northwest Seminar on Topology, Algebra, and Geometry in Data Science (TAG-DS), a hybrid seminar at the University of Washington Math Department. Slides are [here](../files/intrinsic_manifolds_TAG-DS_talk.pdf). 
- My related paper from MICCAI 2022: open access preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02797) and published paper [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16452-1_65).
