## Talks

**The Intrinsic Manifolds of Radiological Images and their Role in Deep Learning *(October 2022)***

For The Pacific Northwest Seminar on Topology, Algebra, and Geometry in Data Science (TAG-DS), a hybrid seminar at the University of Washington Math Department. Slides are [here](../assets/pdf/intrinsic_manifolds_TAG-DS_talk.pdf). 
- My related paper from MICCAI 2022: open access preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02797) and published paper [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16452-1_65).

**What actually *is* Artificial Intelligence, and how does it relate to astronomy? *(August 2022)***
See the talk [here](../assets/pdf/AI_talk_astroX.pdf). For [ERIRA 2022](https://nickk124.github.io/outreach/) ASTRO-X.
