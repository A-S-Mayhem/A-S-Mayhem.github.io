At Berkeley, I am a part of several centers and working groups, including the Center for Healthcare Organizational and Innovation Research [CHOIR](https://choir.berkeley.edu/team/trainees). My work has been supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the California Policy Lab [CPL](https://www.capolicylab.org/data-resources/cpl-graduate-fellowship-grants/).

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I was a Senior Consultant for Precision Advisors working on projects for life sciences firms in New York, NY. I earned my BA and MPH from Brown University, where I was a David A. Winston Health Policy Scholar and won the [Award for Outstanding Academic Accomplishment by a Masterâ€™s Student](https://graduateschool.brown.edu/news/2019-05-21/masters-awards). At Brown, I also co-founded the [Philippine Health Initiative for Research, Service, and Training (PHIRST)](https://phirsthealth.com/#/) alongside faculty, staff, and fellow students. My pre-doctoral work focused on a broad range of topics in public health and has appeared in top journals including [Health Affairs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01418), [the American Journal of Public Health](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305523), [the Journal of the International AIDS Society](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jia2.25582), and [JAMA Health Forum](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2782408). My work has been featured and cited in major media outlets like the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/nyregion/filipino-nurses-coronavirus.html), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/24/health/filipino-nurse-deaths/index.html), and [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/new-study-reveals-previously-invisible-health-issues-among-asians-ins-n1141676), as well as in the [2022 CMS Proposed Rule on Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/04/2022-16217/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-and-activities).

Outside of academia, I am also the President-Elect (2023; President 2024) for the [Filipinx/a/o Community Health Association (Fil-CHA)](https://www.filcha.org/). I enjoy running, Filipino romantic comedies, and rooting for heartbreaking teams in football (Tottenham Hotspur) and Valorant Champions Tour - Americas and Pacific.
