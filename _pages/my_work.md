At Berkeley, I am a part of several centers and working groups, including the Center for Healthcare Organizational and Innovation Research <u><a href="https://choir.berkeley.edu/team/trainees">(CHOIR)</a></u>. My work has been supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the California Policy Lab <u><a href="https://www.capolicylab.org/data-resources/cpl-graduate-fellowship-grants/">(CPL)</a></u>. 

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I was a Senior Consultant for Precision Advisors working on projects for life sciences firms in New York, NY. I earned my BA and MPH from Brown University, where I was a David A. Winston Health Policy Scholar and won the <u><a href="https://graduateschool.brown.edu/news/2019-05-21/masters-awards">Award for Outstanding Academic Accomplishment by a Masterâ€™s Student</a></u>. My pre-doctoral work focused on a broad range of topics in public health and has appeared in top journals including <u><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01418">Health Affairs</a></u>, <u><a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305523">the American Journal of Public Health</a></u>,  <u><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jia2.25582">the Journal of the International AIDS Society</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2782408">JAMA Health Forum</a></u>. My work has been featured and cited in major media outlets like the <u><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/nyregion/filipino-nurses-coronavirus.html">New York Times</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/24/health/filipino-nurse-deaths/index.html">CNN</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/new-study-reveals-previously-invisible-health-issues-among-asians-u-n1141676">NBC</a></u>, as well as in the <u><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/04/2022-16217/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-and-activities">2022 CMS Proposed Rule on Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities</a></u>.

Outside of academia, I am also the President-Elect (2023; President 2024) for the <u><a href="https://www.filcha.org/">Filipinx/a/o Community Health Association (Fil-CHA)</a></u>. I enjoy running, Filipino romantic comedies, and rooting for heartbreaking teams in football (Tottenham Hotspur) and Valorant Champions Tour - Americas and Pacific.
