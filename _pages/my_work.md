At Berkeley, I am a part of several centers and working groups, including the Center for Healthcare Organizational and Innovation Research <u><a href="https://choir.berkeley.edu/team/trainees">CHOIR</a></u>. My work has been supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the California Policy Lab <u><a href="https://www.capolicylab.org/data-resources/cpl-graduate-fellowship-grants/">CPL</a></u>. 

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I was a Senior Consultant for Precision Advisors working on projects for life sciences firms in New York, NY. I earned my BA and MPH from Brown University, where I was a David A. Winston Health Policy Scholar and won the <u><a href="https://graduateschool.brown.edu/news/2019-05-21/masters-awards">Award for Outstanding Academic Accomplishment by a Masterâ€™s Student</a></u>. My pre-doctoral work focused on a broad range of topics in public health and has appeared in top journals including Health Affairs, the American Journal of Public Health, the Journal of the International AIDS Society, and JAMA Health Forum. 

Outside of academia, I enjoy running, Filipino romantic comedies, and rooting for heartbreaking teams in football (Tottenham Hotspur) and Valorant Champions Tour - Americas and Pacific.
