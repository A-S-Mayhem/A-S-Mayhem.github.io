### NYU/Schmidt Futures Computation in Economics Traineeship 2019
I am currently participating in a series of workshops meant for prospective economists to pick up programming skills. Materials from the workshops are available in an online repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/nyupredocs). Additional notes and reading materials from each session are also available [here](https://github.com/ras-princeton).
