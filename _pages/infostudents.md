# Interested in Joining My Lab or Have a Question?

## Prospective Students
Thank you for your interest in the Perception and Language (PLAN) Lab! 
I recruit graduate students through the School of Information Sciences (iSchool), 
the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science (CS), and the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department at UIUC.
If you are applying to any of these UIUC Ph.D./M.S. programs and are interested in working in my lab, 
please submit your application directly and complete this [interest form](https://forms.gle/biPTEzwSR5841T4eA). If there’s a good fit, I’ll be in touch to discuss potential opportunities. Candidates with experience in [Embodied AI](https://isminoula.github.io/readings) topics, who are passionate about advancing this field, and have a strong research background in computer vision or multimodal machine learning are highly encouraged to apply. 

## Current UIUC Students
If you’re already a UIUC student and you are interested in joining my lab, please fill out the [interest form](https://forms.gle/biPTEzwSR5841T4eA). 
I will contact you if there are available positions that match your background and research interests. It is expected that you have taken at least one core ML-related course before reaching out. Note that undergraduate students are typically recruited through the [NCSA SPIN](https://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/) program. If you are a pre-college student, I encourage you to check the [UIUC Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering (WYSE)](https://wyse.grainger.illinois.edu) programs for available opportunities. 
For any other general inquiries (e.g., independent studies, courses, general topics of interest, or other questions), 
I hold *Ask Me Anything (AMA)* office hours every Tuesday, 4-5pm CT, at Office #5156 in the iSchool Hub Building (614 E. Daniel St.) and on [Zoom](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/89862098818?pwd=bir98nipGTZa8EOuesF2viXz7Ko70a.1).

## Important Note
<u>Due to a large volume of emails, I am unable to respond to individual queries via email or other platforms.</u>
If you do not receive a response, it is likely that there are no positions currently available or 
that your research interests and/or background are not a match for our lab at this time. 
Finally, I am currently not recruiting students at Virginia Tech, either at the Blacksburg or the NOVA campus.
