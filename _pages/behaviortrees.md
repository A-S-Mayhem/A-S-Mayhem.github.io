| **First book on Behavior Trees:** The pre-print of our book titled Behavior Trees in Robotics and AI is available here.  The book is published by CRC Press Taylor & Francis. You can buy the hardcover copy and the ebook either on the CRC Press Store or Amazon. |  ![](http://michelecolledanchise.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/btbook.jpg) |
| **Behavior Trees in Robmosys:** We are introducing Behavior Trees in the RobMoSys framework and we are working towards the development of formal verification tools to assess the correctness of defined behaviors in form of Behavior Trees. |    ![](http://michelecolledanchise.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/robmosyspng.png)   |
| **Our open source library in ROS:** We have published our open source library for Behavior Trees in both github (link) and ros.org (link). | ![](http://michelecolledanchise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rosLarge-680x365_c-e1478009975553.png) |  
| **Blended Acting and Planning using Behavior Trees:** We have proposed a framework that automatically synthesize a Behavior Tree that satisfies a given goal. it Is an attempt to  address the challenges regarding blending planning and acting: hierarchical organized deliberation and continual planning and deliberation.| ![](http://michelecolledanchise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/YoubotSceneStep5-e1478009786423.jpg)|
| **Reinforcement Learning Using Behavior Trees:** Taking advantage of modularity and reactiveness of Behavior Trees,, we propose a model-free Automated Planned framework using Genetic Programming to derive an action plan for an autonomous agent to achieve a given goal in unknown environments. The advantages of the proposed approach is based on the advantages of BT over a genera FSM. In particular our approach avoids the problem of logic violation during the learning process.| ![](http://michelecolledanchise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/receptive-e1429784537951.png)|
