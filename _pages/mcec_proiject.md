# The MCEC Project

The Multilingual College Email Corpus Project (MCEC) is an ongoing collection of student an instructor emails across several departments from the University of Arizona.

It is a first-of-its-kind project given its wide scope (several disciplines and academic levels) and the sociolinguistic information collected (L1, L2, linguistic experiences, heritage languages, and more).

The MCEC was initiated by me as my Ph.D. dissertation project and it has grown since then. I am currently leading a team of six graduate students from three different departments.

### Expected outcomes and impacts

Concrete outcomes of our work will include the creation of the following materials:
- A list of recommendations and examples for writing successful college emails.
- Evidence-based rubrics for students to evaluate the likelihood of success of their emails.
- Curricula and pedagogical materials such as exercises and or word/phrase lists designed to improve studentsâ€™ pragmatic competence in college email communication.

These resources are aimed to be used by the academic community within and outside the U.A and will be distributed freely through the University of Arizona Research Campus Repository (ReDATA) under an open-source license. The resources will support student success (a) interpersonally by helping them write emails which foster positive rapport between them and their instructors, and (b) transactionally by teaching them how to be more effective communicators and improve their interpersonal competence. Our goal is to help improving students' college email communication and advance their global, cultural, and professional literacy.

### Future plans

While currently contained at the University level, we expect to grow beyond its walls so that students and instructors from all over the country and world can more easily discover how to better interact with each other given their particular linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
