Beyond Astrophysics, I enjoy playing and watching all kinds of sports, especially soccer. I was a member of my high school's soccer team and played intramural soccer throughout my time at Columbia (fun fact: I can play any position on the field, from goalkeeper to striker).   
I am a die-hard fan of [Beijing Guoan FC](http://www.fcguoan.com/en/), a soccer team from my hometown Beijing, China.
