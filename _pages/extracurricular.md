Beyond Astrophysics, I enjoy playing and watching all kinds of sports, especially soccer. I was a member of my high school's soccer team and played intramural soccer throughout my time at Columbia (fun fact: I can play any position on the field, from goalkeeper to striker).   
I am a die-hard fan of [Beijing Guoan FC](http://www.fcguoan.com/en/), a soccer team from my hometown Beijing, China.

## A Message that is Designed to Last for 10,000 Years

How does a civilization create a message that can last for 10,000 years?

In Summer 2020, Ms. Madeline Sunley, an artist and oil painter, asked me this question. Our goal was to artistically render a message that will be placed at 
the radioactive waste storage site at New Mexico to warn people against the everlasting radioactive harm, which can last up to 10,000 years. This is officially 
known as the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) project 



Collaborated with Ms. Madeline Sunley to translate a message that is intended to last 10,000 years into oracle bone Chinese. 
The message will be placed at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico and serves to warn people against the everlasting harm of the radioactive waste stored there. 
Used astronomical signs like constellation patterns to convey the passage and recording of time on the scale of tens of thousands of years.
