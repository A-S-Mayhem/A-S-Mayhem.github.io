- **Earthquake Dataset**

Soon I will be posting my original dataset on historical earthquakes, which I use to measure state capacities overtime. [Paper](https://github.com/hbahamonde/Earthquake_Paper/raw/master/status.txt). [Abstract](https://github.com/hbahamonde/Earthquake_Paper/raw/master/abstract.txt).

- **Vote-Selling: List and Conjoint Experimental Dataset**

Soon I will be posting my original experimental dataset on vote-selling, which I use to study individual propensities of votes-selling, in its relationship with support for the democracy in the U.S. **Paper in preparation**. [Abstract](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbahamonde/Vote_Selling/master/abstract.txt).

- **Panel Experiment on Memory and Candidate Evaluation** (With Rick Lau [Rutgers] and Mona Kleinberg [UMass - Lowell]).

Soon I will be posting our original dataset where we looked at presidential evaluations in a panel of ten waves. We are particularly interested in issues related to memory. **Paper in preparation**. [Abstract](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbahamonde/Running_Tally/master/abstract.txt).
