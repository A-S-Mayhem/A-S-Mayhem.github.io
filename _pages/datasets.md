1. **Earthquake Dataset**

Soon I will be posting my original dataset on historical earthquakes, which I use to measure state capacities overtime. [Paper](https://github.com/hbahamonde/Earthquake_Paper/raw/master/status.txt). [Abstract](https://github.com/hbahamonde/Earthquake_Paper/raw/master/abstract.txt)

2. **Vote-Selling: List and Conjoint Experimental Dataset**

Soon I will be posting my original experimental dataset on vote-selling, which I use to study individual propensities of votes-selling, in its relationship with support for the democracy in the U.S. [Paper](https://github.com/hbahamonde/Vote_Selling/blob/master/abstract.txt).
