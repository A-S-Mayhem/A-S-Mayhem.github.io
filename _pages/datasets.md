2. **Vote-Selling: List and Conjoint Experimental Dataset**

Soon I will be posting my original experimental dataset on vote-selling, which I use to study individual propensities of votes-selling, in its relationship with support for the democracy in the U.S. [Paper in preparation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbahamonde/Vote_Selling/master/abstract.txt).

3. **Panel Experiment on Memory and Candidate Evaluation** (With Rick Lau [Rutgers] and Mona Kleinberg [UMass - Lowell])

Soon I will be posting our original dataset where we looked at presidential evaluations in a panel of ten waves. We are particularly interested in issues related to memory.
