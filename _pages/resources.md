Appointments
============

If you need to see me, make an appointment using the box below by selecting a day and time.

* There is *no* need for confirmation. I will receive an alert when you schedule a meeting with me. 
* Briefly indicate the reason for the meeting. 

* *All kinds of questions/concerns are welcomed*. 
* While I encourage you to make an appointment in advance, my doors are always open. Feel free to stop by.
* **I am looking forward to meeting you!**

Grade Appealing Policy
=======================

As an undergraduate student, it is your right to ask for a grade appeal. At the same time, I take grading very seriously. Please, read carefully my policy on grade appeals.
