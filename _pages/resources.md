Email Etiquette
===============

1. Use a clear subject line. 
2. Use a salutation and signature. 
3. Use standard punctuation, capitalization, spelling and grammar. 
4. Do your part in solving what you need to solve. 
5. Be aware of concerns about entitlement.

- Remember: If you have a question, **contact me first**. Professors are always *very busy*, so it is my job to be the first one in trying to answer your questions.
