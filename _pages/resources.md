Grade Appealing Policy
=======================

As an undergraduate student, it is your right to ask for a grade appeal. At the same time, I take grading very seriously. Please, read carefully my policy on grade appeals.

Appointments
============

If you need to see me, **do not email me** but instead make directly an appointment [here](https://calendly.com/bahamonde/officehours). 

* There is *no* need for confirmation. I will receive an alert when you schedule a meeting with me. 
* Briefly indicate the reason for the meeting. 

* *All kinds of questions/concerns are welcomed*. 
* **I am looking forward to meeting you!**
