As of fall quarter ‘23, I am exploring projects in Dr. Garcia’s lab group, the SORA (Software Aurora) Lab, which includes Android analysis, autonomous driving testing & analysis, architectural programming-language modules, and open-source security.

I am most interested in software security, human elements of software engineering & security, and security education, and I have previous experience with software mutation testing, cyber-physical systems, and IoT security
