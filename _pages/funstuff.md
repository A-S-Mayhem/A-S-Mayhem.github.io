In my free time I like to play soccer.

I am a huge Game of Thrones fan as well. One of my life goals is to visit all the major Game of Thrones filming sites.

Here is a picture of me at the Wilding Camp. It was filmed on a glacier!

Here I am at Eastwatch by the Sea.

And finally, the entrance to the Vale (which is actually the location of a ridge between two tectonic plates).
