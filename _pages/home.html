<p>I graduated from the University of Maryland in May of 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art. I am currently a Quantitative Analyst in the Model Risk Management division at Fannie Mae. Bridging economics, finance, computer science, and design is at the core of all of my work. I'm currently studying trends in macroeconomic indicators leading up to and during recessions and in a near future, I'd like to study financial literacy, household decision making, poverty, and housing policy.</p>
