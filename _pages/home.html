<p>I graduated from the University of Maryland in May of 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art.
  I am a Quantitative Analyst in the Model Risk Management division at Fannie Mae and I am currently studying the impact of COVID-19 on housing. In particular, I am looking at how infection rates and state-level shutdowns impact forbearance takeup and exit. 
  My research interests include, but are not limited to: urban development, financial literacy, nudges and decision making, poverty, and housing.</p>
