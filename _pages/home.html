        I am a Master's student at Northwestern University as well as a Machine Learning Engineer at Toyota Connected North America. My work at Toyota is focused on the research and development of computer vision and reinforcement learning methods to aid in autonomous decision-making in our vehicles. My time at Northwestern is currently culminating in a research thesis.
