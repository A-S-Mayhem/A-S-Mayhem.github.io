<p>I am currently a PhD candidate in the University of Maryland’s Economics PhD program. I am interested in housing, with a particular focus on household-level decision
  making, social perceptions of renting/owning, rent control, and the broader impacts of housing on a region’s overall economic health. I am also interested in issues 
  of inequality and public welfare. I am currently working as an RA for Melissa Kearney. 
<p>I graduated from the University of Maryland with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art. Prior to starting my PhD at Maryland I spent two and a half years at Fannie Mae as a quantitative modeler in the Model Risk Management Division. </p>
