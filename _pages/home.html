<p>I graduated from the University of Maryland in May of 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art.
  I am a Quantitative Analyst in the Model Risk Management division at Fannie Mae and I am currently studying trends in macroeconomic indicators leading up to and during recessions, especially unemployment and home prices. 
  My research interests include, but are not limited to: financial literacy, nudges and decision making, poverty, and housing.</p>
