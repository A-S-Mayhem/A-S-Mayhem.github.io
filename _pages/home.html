        I am a Master's student at Northwestern University as well as a Machine Learning Engineer at Toyota Connected North America. My work at Toyota is focused on the research and development of computer vision and reinforcement learning (RL) methods to aid in autonomous decision-making in our vehicles. My time at Northwestern is currently culminating in a research thesis in which I develop $k$-Step Latent, a novel representation learning routine for reinforcement learning that provides state-of-the-art results in the popular PlaNet benchmark suite. See the "MS Thesis" tab for more detail on KSL and the analysis of latent representations.

        My research interests include representation learning and reinforcement learning
        with a focus on solving the challenges of real-world RL. See the "Research" tab for more information on my research experience.
