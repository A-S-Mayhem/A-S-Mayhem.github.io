    <p>
        I am a Master's student at Northwestern University, a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Autonomous Agents Research Group</a> (AARG), and a Machine Learning Engineer at Toyota Connected North America.
        My time at Northwestern is currently culminating in a research thesis in which I develop $k$-Step Latent (KSL), a novel representation learning routine for RL that provides state-of-the-art results in the popular PlaNet benchmark suite.
        See the "MS Thesis" tab for more detail on KSL and the analysis of latent representations.
        My research at AARG has thus far focused on representation learning and parameter sharing in single- and multi-agent systems.
        My work at Toyota is focused on the research and development of computer vision and reinforcement learning (RL) methods to aid in autonomous decision-making in our vehicles.

        My research interests include representation learning and reinforcement learning
        with a focus on solving the challenges of real-world RL. See the "Research" tab for more information on my research experience.
