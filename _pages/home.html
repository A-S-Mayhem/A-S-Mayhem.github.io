<p>I am currently a graduate student in the University of Maryland’s Economics PhD program. I am interested in housing, with a particular focus on household-level decision making, social perceptions of renting/owning, rent control, and the broader impacts of housing on a region’s overall economic health. 
<p>I graduated from the University of Maryland with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Studio Art. I also worked at Fannie Mae as a quantitative modeler in the Model Risk Management Division. </p>
