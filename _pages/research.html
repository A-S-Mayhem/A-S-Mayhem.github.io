<h1>Research Summary</h1> 

<p> I am presently a PhD student in theory of computation group at the school of computer science in the University of Birmingham. My research is pretty much focused on the study of 2-categorical (really bicategorical!) aspects of toposes; bi-limits, bi-colimits, fibrations and opfibrations, factorization systems, etc.
