  This page deals with the legacy stuff, left over from previous incarnations of my website. 
  I keep it around just in case somebody finds it useful.
  For more recent stuff you're better off following my work on <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=lgc4lkkAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  If you are wandering what interests me right now, it's all things deep learning, from convolutional networks and GANs, over LSTMs to Reinforcement Learning.  
  If these are things you are not familiar with, think Neural Networks and AI.
