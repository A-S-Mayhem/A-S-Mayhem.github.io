<p> I am presently a PhD student in theory of computation group at the school of computer science in the University of Birmingham. My research is pretty much focused on the study of 2-categorical aspects of toposes.

<p>  
I am also one of the organizers of category theory reading group (CARGO) at at the school of computer science which meets on every Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. in room 245. Here is the archive of talks: <a href="http://talks.bham.ac.uk/show/archive/1233" target="_blank"><font color="B22222">CARGO archive</font></a>. Feel free to subscribe to our <a href= "https://mailman.cs.bham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/cargo/" target="_blank"><font color="B22222">mailing list</font></a>. Let me also mention the archive of our <a href="http://talks.bham.ac.uk/show/index/86" target="_blank"><font color="B22222">Theory Seminars</font></a> talks on Fridays. I have given four talks whose abstract is available there.
</p>  
  
<p> Sometimes I find enough time and I write the notes of talks I give in CARGO. You can find them here: <a href="https://sinhp.github.io/Mathematical-scribblings/" target="_blank"><font color="B22222">Mathematical Scribblings</font></a>.
