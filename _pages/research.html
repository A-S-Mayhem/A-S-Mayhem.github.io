<p>
  This page deals with the legacy stuff, left over from previous incarnations of my website. 
  I keep it around just in case somebody finds it useful.
  For more recent stuff you're better off following my work on <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=lgc4lkkAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>.
