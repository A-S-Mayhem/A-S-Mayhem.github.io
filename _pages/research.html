<p> I am presently a PhD student in theory of computation group at the school of computer science in the University of Birmingham. My research is pretty much focused on the study of 2-categorical (really bicategorical!) aspects of toposes; bi-limits, bi-colimits, fibrations and opfibrations, factorization systems, etc.

<h2>CARGO</h2> 
<p>  
I am one of the organizers of category theory reading group (CARGO). The meetings takes place at the school of computer science on a weekly basis. The particiants are mostly PhD students and research fellows in theoretical computer science.

<ul> 
  <li> From 2015-2017, CARGO meetings used to takes place at the school of computer science on every Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. in room 245. For the academic year of 2017-2018 we have our meetings on Thursdays at 11:00 a.m. in the same room.

Let me also mention the archive of our <a href="http://talks.bham.ac.uk/show/index/86" target="_blank"><font color="#336666">Theory Seminars</font></a> talks on Fridays. I have given four talks in theory seminars and numerous talks in CARGO. Sometimes I find enough time and I write the notes of the talks which can be found in below.

 <li> Here is a list of topics considered to be discussed in Autumn 2017 in Category Reading Group seminars as well as informal archive for suggested topics since Summer 2015: <a href= "/files/CT/Potential-topics.pdf" target= "_blank"><font color="#336666">Potential topics</font></a> and <a href= "https://cargo.bram.xyz/" target= "_blank"><font color="#336666">Informal archive</font></a>.

<h2>Expository Papers And Notes</h2>

Writing notes helps me to grasp a mathematical concept or construction and they become less elusive in my mind. Here are the notes 
from some of my talks for which I had time to type them up. Any reports of mistakes and errors from the reader are always welcome. Also, suggestions and recommendations on how to improve a presentation of a concept or how to communicate the essential ideas of a construction are greatly appreciated.
