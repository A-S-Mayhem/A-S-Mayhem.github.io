  <b> Main Projects </b>
  <br>
  1. Computational neurethological basis of primate touch: brief description with impact...
  <br>
  2. Neural correlates of natural social primate behavior: a state-of-the-art project combining wireless neurophysiology and deep learning-based computer vision to characterize the neural mechanisms underlying rhesus macaque social behavior. 
  <b>With:</b> <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=0o2ZT8wAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_self">Camille Testard</a>, <a href="http://plattlabs.rocks/our-team/sebastien-tremblay" target="_self">Sebastien Tremblay</a>
  <br>
  3. <a href="https://felipe-parodi.github.io//macsuite/" target="_self"><em>MacSuite</em></a>: our software project for bringing computational tools to primatologists within and beyond the lab.
  <br>
  4. RL for animal behavior: RL agents can help us understand... i previously explored imitation learning using   "expert" human gait data to teach agents to walk from scratch. the last 1/3 of my phd will be devoted to exploring the potential of IRL to model social primate behavior
