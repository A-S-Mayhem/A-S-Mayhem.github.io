**Bio:** The battle between microbes and their viruses is ancient and ongoing. Over billions of years of coevolution, microbes have evolved a great diversity of strategies to protect themselves against viral infections. What drives selection favoring a particular antiviral defense strategy? What new defense systems are still waiting to be discovered? How do defense systems coevolve with pathogens over time, and how does this coevolution feed back into the dynamics of host-virus interactions? The central theme of my previous and ongoing work is the application of tools from the fields of machine learning and complex systems science, alongside more traditional approaches from population genetics and theoretical ecology, to understand the ecology and evolution of antiviral defense strategies.
