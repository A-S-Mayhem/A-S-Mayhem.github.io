I'm a philosopher and cognitive scientist engaged in both theoretical and experimental research in embodied cognitive science. The primary focus of my research is on the implications of embodiment for how we make sense of "higher cognition" and technologically-supported problem solving, including in scientific practice. My main influences are the scientific traditions of Gibsonian ecological psychology and dynamical systems theory, and the philosophical traditions of pragmatism and phenomenology.
