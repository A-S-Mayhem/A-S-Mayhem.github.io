## Infographics

As a volunteer in [Economica](https://economica.pe/), I am in charge of designing infographics on topics in economics. Here you can find some of my research and designs :

* [Las Microfinanzas como herramienta para lograr el objetivo de la inclusión financiera](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaTHzh-r2yE/?igshid=NWRhNmQxMjQ=) - Revista Economica, (February 2022, Peru)
    <em>With Diana Casimiro</em>

 This infographic seeks to explain what microfinance is and how microfinance institutions are constituted in the Peruvian market. After having made these terms clear, it was found that microfinance entities concentrate the highest penetration of microcredits to MYPES in the poorest sectors of our country (14.05%) in 2020, and instead the other financial companies traditional concentrated 3.79%, which demonstrates the fundamental role of MFIs in deepening and reducing poverty in the country.

Also, here are some web articles I wrote in Spanish:

 * [La controversia de los COAR: una puerta para la discusión de la calidad del sistema educativo](https://economica.pe/la-controversia-de-los-coar-una-puerta-para-la-discusion-de-la-calidad-del-sistema-educativo/) - Revista Economica, (Nov 2020, Peru) 
 
    This article points out some axes of debate with respect to the High Achievement Schools (COAR). The relevance of their existence is controversial insofar as it involves the component of equity in the quality of education, the cost that this strategy represents for the state and the mixed results it has on students. The discussion on whether or not this model should be followed highlights a precarious education system that we are all familiar with, but which, in times of crisis, is impossible to ignore and calls for a call for quality public education for all.
 
 * [Las licencias obligatorias de las vacunas y sus posibilidades en la pandemia del Covid-19](https://economica.pe/las-licencias-obligatorias-de-las-vacunas-y-sus-posibilidades-en-la-pandemia-del-covid-19/) - Revista Economica, (Feb 2021, Peru)
 
    The vaccine supply crisis leads us to consider possible avenues for a solution. Among them, compulsory licensing presents a way to increase vaccine availability, but not without its corresponding challenges for the countries that implement it. Therefore, a review of what compulsory licensing is, what it entails, how it can help in this crisis, and how it can do so successfully, is undertaken. 

* [Cuando migrar no es suficiente:  Una comparación de la calidad del empleo de los migrantes y no migrantes en el Perú urbano entre el 2019 y 2020](https://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/economica/article/view/25082) - Revista Economica, (March 2021, Peru)
    <em> With [Diego Delgado Díaz](https://github.com/DiegoDelgadoD/)</em>
 
    This research seeks to analyse the job quality of interdepartmental migrants in urban areas during 2019 and 2020. Job quality, under the decent work approach, encompasses dimensions of workers' well-being. After constructing an index and finding that job quality deteriorated, we find, using a generalised ordinal logit, that there is no-relation between being migrant and job quality. Nonetheless there are other sociodemographic characteristics that migrants usually share which are linked to the lowest job quality. 

**As research assistant volunteer at City Makers**, I support a proyect related the impact of STEM education on women in Moquegua. I assisted PhD.candidate Fabiola M. Alba Vivar and other multidisciplinary members of the organization.
