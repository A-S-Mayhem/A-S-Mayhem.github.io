## Infographics

As a volunteer in [Economica](https://economica.pe/), I am in charge of designing infographics on topics in economics. Here you can find some of my research and designs :

* [Las Microfinanzas como herramienta para lograr el objetivo de la inclusión financiera](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaTHzh-r2yE/?igshid=NWRhNmQxMjQ=) - Revista Economica, (February 2022, Peru)
    <em>With Diana Casimiro</em>

 This infographic seeks to explain what microfinance is and how microfinance institutions are constituted in the Peruvian market. After having made these terms clear, it was found that microfinance entities concentrate the highest penetration of microcredits to MYPES in the poorest sectors of our country (14.05%) in 2020, and instead the other financial companies traditional concentrated 3.79%, which demonstrates the fundamental role of MFIs in deepening and reducing poverty in the country.

Also, here are some web articles I wrote in Spanish:

 * [¿Qué son los bienes públicos mundiales?](https://www.instagram.com/p/CZDRdVwL6nr/?igshid=NWRhNmQxMjQ=) - Revista Economica, (January 2022, Peru) 
    <em>With Diana Casimiro</em>
 
   Here, we define global public goods as those whose benefits affect all citizens of the world. Given that it involves a large number of individuals, it is essential to guarantee the supply of this type of goods and the most appropriate institution to coordinate the supply of local and national public goods is the state government. Finally, as an example of the triumphs and limitations of international coordination, the ratification of the Paris Agreement is given as an example.

    The vaccine supply crisis leads us to consider possible avenues for a solution. Among them, compulsory licensing presents a way to increase vaccine availability, but not without its corresponding challenges for the countries that implement it. Therefore, a review of what compulsory licensing is, what it entails, how it can help in this crisis, and how it can do so successfully, is undertaken. 

* [Cuando migrar no es suficiente:  Una comparación de la calidad del empleo de los migrantes y no migrantes en el Perú urbano entre el 2019 y 2020](https://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/economica/article/view/25082) - Revista Economica, (March 2021, Peru)
    <em> With [Diego Delgado Díaz](https://github.com/DiegoDelgadoD/)</em>
 
    This research seeks to analyse the job quality of interdepartmental migrants in urban areas during 2019 and 2020. Job quality, under the decent work approach, encompasses dimensions of workers' well-being. After constructing an index and finding that job quality deteriorated, we find, using a generalised ordinal logit, that there is no-relation between being migrant and job quality. Nonetheless there are other sociodemographic characteristics that migrants usually share which are linked to the lowest job quality. 

**As research assistant volunteer at City Makers**, I support a proyect related the impact of STEM education on women in Moquegua. I assisted PhD.candidate Fabiola M. Alba Vivar and other multidisciplinary members of the organization.
