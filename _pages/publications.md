## Current Research

**[Can Supply Shocks facilitate Price Coordination? Evidence from the Airline Industry] (Very preliminary)**
**Summary:** *I start with a descriptive analysis of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding. I show that ticket prices increased significantly on affected routes using a differences-in-difference event study framework. The price increases are primarily driven by Southwest (the low cost carrier) while the remaining major airlines (AA, Delta, and United) reduced prices in response to the shock. I start by measuring the welfare effects of this supply shock by estimating demand. I then focus on the conduct angle--can the rival airline prices increases be explained by Nash-Bertrand? I use Ciliberto and Williams' (2014) conduct tests to answer this question.*

**Previous Versions:** This paper was originally written in 2019 for Eric Ohrn's senior seminar in Microeconometrics at Grinnell. It was titled "Market Power in Airlines: Evidence from the Boeing 737 MAX Grounding." It won the Midwest Economics Association's Best Undergraduate Paper Award in 2020.

**[Racial and Gender Bias in Child Maltreatment Reporting Decisions: Results of a Randomized Vignette Experiment] (Draft coming soon)**
(with Ian Ayres and Sonia Quinn)
**Summary:** *In this randomized vignette experiment, we asked 4,000 respondents through a YouGov survey to decide how likely they would be to report potential instances of child maltreatment to authorities. We used racialized and gendered names to suggest randomize the identities of the parents and children that respondents viewed in each of the ten vignettes that were based on real-life eventsthey were shown. We find that respondents were less likely to report potential child maltreatment when the vignette used non-White names to describe the family participants. Respondents were less likely to report when a male child was involved, and more likely to report when a male parent was involved. The uncovered racial and gender were more pronounced in vignettes that were of intermediate severity.*

**[The Impact of Involuntary Outpatient Committment Laws on Mental Health Outcomes] (Very preliminary)**
(with Ian Ayres)
**Summary:** *We aim to measure how changes in the Involuntary Outpatient Committment (sometimes known as Assissted Outpatient Laws, AOT) can impact the health outcomes of suicide rates. AOT laws rely on a standard of dangerousness (although this varies by state) to committ individuals to outpatient facilities for a few days. In 1971, Florida passed the "Baker Act" which allows the involuntary institutionalization and examination of an individual by judges, law enforcement officials, physicians, or mental health professionals. Similar laws have been enacted in 43 states since then. These policy changes offer an opportunity to measure the impact of involuntary committment on health outcomes, especially suicide and gun violence. We also utilize variation in mental health capacity at the county level to measure the heterogenous impacts of these laws.*
