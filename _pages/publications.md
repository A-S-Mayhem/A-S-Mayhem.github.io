     <h2 class="accordion-header">Synthetic Homotopy Theory and Classifying Principal Bundles in Homotopy Type Theory</h2> 
     <div class="accordion-content"> 
        <p>My masters dissertation, written over the course of Hilary Term 2019. It introduces homotopy type theory and looks at doing                _synthetic_ homotopy theory, focussing particularly on the theory of fibre bundles. The main result is a proof in homotopy                  type theory of a theorem originally due to Gottlieb about the homotopy groups of the space $Map(X, K(G,1))$ of maps from a                  base space $X$ into the classifying space of a discrete group $G$.</p>
