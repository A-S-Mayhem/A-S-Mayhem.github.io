<br><b>Abstract</b>. Nationwide, school principals are given wide discretion to use disciplinary tools like suspension and expulsion to create a safe learning environment. There is legitimate concern that this power can have negative consequences, particularly for the students who are excluded. This study uses linked disciplinary, education, and criminal justice records from 2008 to 2016 in North Carolina to examine the impact of principal-driven disciplinary decisions on middle school student outcomes. We find that principals who are more likely to remove students do appear to create safer schools through a reduction in minor student misconduct. However, this deterrence comes at a high cost – these harsher principals generate more juvenile justice complaints and reduce high school graduation rates for all students in their schools. Students who committed minor disciplinary infractions in a school with a harsh principal suffer additional declines in attendance and test scores. Finally, principals exhibiting racial bias in their disciplinary decisions also widen educational gaps between White and Black students.

<br>Sorensen, Lucy C. and Stephen B. Holt. <a href="https://www.edworkingpapers.com/ai20-263">Charter School Growth and the Evolution of Local Teacher Labor Markets</a>. Annenberg Institute EdWorkingPaper 20-263.
<br><b>Abstract</b>. Since their introduction in the 1990s, charter schools have grown from a small-scale experiment to a ubiquitous feature of the public education landscape. The current study uses the legislative removal of a cap on the maximum number of charters, and the weakening of regulations on these new schools, in North Carolina as a natural experiment to assess the intensive impacts of charter school growth on teacher quality and student composition in traditional public schools (TPS) at different levels of local market penetration. Using an instrumental variable difference-in-differences approach to account for endogenous charter demand, we find that intensive local charter entry reduces the inflow of new teachers at nearby TPS, leading to a more experienced and credentialed teaching workforce on average. However, we find that the entry of charters serving predominantly White students leads to reductions in average teacher experience, effectiveness, and credentials at nearby TPS. Overall these findings suggest that the composition of the teacher workforce in TPS will continue to change as charter schools further expand, and that the spillover effects of future charter expansion will vary by the types of students served by charters.

<br><b>Abstract</b>. The “defund the police” movement has recently called for the removal of police – or school resource officers (SROs) – from schools. This call is driven by concerns that SROs may heighten student contact with criminal justice or lead to disproportionately harsh disciplinary consequences. The current study uses linked disciplinary, academic, juvenile justice, and adult conviction data from North Carolina to estimate the effects of middle school SROs on a variety of student outcomes. Our findings indicate that SROs decrease the incidence of serious violence, but also increase the use of out-of-school suspensions, transfers, expulsions, and police referrals. This study provides new insights into the effects of police in schools, and implies new directions for policies, training, and accountability.

<br><br>Sorensen, Lucy, Youngsung Kim, and Moontae Hwang. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3717648">Property Tax Caps and the Opportunity Gap Between Low- and High-Wealth Districts</a>. SSRN Working Paper.
<br><b>Abstract</b>. The property tax burden experienced by households varies widely across the country. Many states have instituted laws to limit property taxes, with downstream implications for local finances and the provision of public services. The current study examines the impacts of a property tax cap introduced in New York State in 2011 on public education revenues and student achievement. It uses an instrumental variables approach with a panel dataset of 663 school districts from 2006 to 2016. Our findings show that for each $1,000 of per-pupil predicted levies above the allowed amount under the cap, districts lost $235 per pupil in total revenues. For each $1,000 loss in per-pupil revenues from the cap, student performance subsequently dropped by approximately 0.04 standard deviations in both reading and math. These financial and educational costs accrued primarily to high-wealth districts, as lower-wealth districts were buffered from adverse effects by their low reliance on property taxes.
