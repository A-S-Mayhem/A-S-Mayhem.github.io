    Various illegal activities on Ethereum are rampant, seriously jeopardizing the systemâ€™s trading security and long-term development. In this paper, we propose the first general
framework for account risk rating on Ethereum, which includes
a devisable suspiciousness metric to adapt to various illicit fraud
detection and a network propagation mechanism to formulate
the relations between accounts and transactions.

    Since money laundering on Ethereum is an emerging means, little
is known about money laundering on Ethereum. To fill the gap,
in this paper, we conduct an in-depth study on Ethereum money
laundering through the lens of a representative security
event on Upbit Exchange to explore money laundering traits
on Ethereum. we summarize the findings of money laundering
on Ethereum, which lay the groundwork for money
laundering detection on Ethereum.
