## Research highlights

Kaaronen, R. O., Manninen, M. A., & Eronen, J. T. (2023). [Body-based units of measure in cultural evolution](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf1936). _Science, 380_(6648), 948-954. [Open access link](https://osf.io/rjde7/).

> We documented body-based units of measure across the world in 186 cultures. We argue that body-based measurement systems have had some advantages, such as ergonomic design, and that consequently body-based measurement has persisted even millennia after the first measurement standards emerged.
