### Inventor's Inequality Aversion
### Abstract:
The consequences of income inequality extend beyond social and moral considerations, with tangible economic implications for the long-term performance of companies. Using the first-time disclosure of the SEC-mandated CEO-worker pay ratio as proxy for within-firm inequality, I find a significant decrease in innovation of firms disclosing high pay ratios, explained by an increase in inventor mobility and a decrease in productivity. Inventor characteristics, such as gender, race, and age cohorts, explain variations in responses, consistent with the inequality aversion theory.

### On the Resilience of Managerial Overconfidence
### Abstract:
This paper examines the resiliency of CEO overconfidence using a staggered Difference-in-Difference model of natural disasters occurring between 1996 and 2017 as proxy for distress. I examine the role of overconfidence in mediating the relationship between corporate innovation and natural disasters. The results are two-fold: (1) Affected firms led by overconfident CEOs consistently underperform relative to affected firms led by non-overconfident CEOs (2) The negative relationship between disasters and innovation outcomes documented in the literature is driven entirely by overconfident CEOs. Neither changes in R\&D expenditure nor changes in inventor productivity explain the results. However, risk perception and an increase in risk-aversion of Overconfident CEOs following natural disasters could explain the reduction in innovation outcomes. The results are robust to alternative specifications of both disaster risk and managerial overconfidence. The findings highlight the limitations of the benefits of overconfidence. 

## Risk Management and Insurance
### The National Flood Insurance Program, Racial and Ethnic Disparity, and the Pursuit of Environmental Justice 
*With Jing Ai*
### Abstract: 
Flood insurance by the NFIP is the most important risk management infrastructure in the 
U.S. to protect vulnerabilities and build resilience to increasing natural disasters. Racial 
and ethnic minorities comprise the most vulnerable populations. We examine disparities 
in insurance outcomes for these groups. Using a combined dataset of nationwide flood 
insurance policies and claims, and census tract level demographics, we find that 
minorities tend to pay higher premium, obtain less coverage per premium dollar, and 
have a lower likelihood of getting claims paid. They also have lower insurance take up 
rates. Our results add to the discussions on discrimination by institutions and have significant public policy implications.

### The Demographics of Property Insurance: Evidence from the Homeowners Insurance Market 
*With Jing Ai and Charles Nyce*
### Abstract:
We provide evidence that there is a disparate impact on minorities of the availability of private 
market property insurance in Florida. We show that demographic factors explain reduced private 
market penetration. Results are largely consistent between the two measures of residual market 
(Citizens’) market presence (policy count, total exposure) and across the fixed effects models 
with or without the spatial lag. In general, we find that while risk exposure does seem to be 
contribute significantly to Citizens’ presence, supporting its purpose as a last resort insurer, both 
its market share and property risk exposure are significantly higher in minority concentrated 
census block groups.
