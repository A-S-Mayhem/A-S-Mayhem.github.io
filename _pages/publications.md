## Book
- Manning, C., Smith, I. & **Tuncel, O.** 2023. [Parties, politics, peace: Electoral inclusion as peacebuilding](https://www.routledge.com/Parties-Politics-Peace-Electoral-Inclusion-as-Peacebuilding/Manning-Smith-Gurlek/p/book/9781032318936). *Routledge*. (expected June 2023)
   -  <details><summary> Abstract </summary> <br> Parties, Politics, Peace: Electoral Inclusion as Peacebuilding tries to understand post-conflict parties as political actors, and especially to understand their role in the longer-term processes of state building and peace building. This work will be the first book-length, large-N comparative study to explore systematically the empirical record of participation and performance in electoral politics by political parties formed out of armed insurgencies in the era of “liberal peacebuilding.” The project is informed by our analysis of an original dataset tracking the formation, participation, and performance of electoral parties by former armed insurgent groups. The original data that covers all civil wars ending in 1990 or later, and includes conflicts that vary in duration, intensity, incompatibility, and several other factors. The book uses a multi-method approach, beginning with quantitative analysis of post-insurgent party formation and plotting the electoral performance of these parties over time. The book finds consistent patterns in electoral performance over time and set out to explore the meaning and importance of these patterns through several different small-n comparative analyses. This book is written for academic audience (scholars in the field and graduate students), but we also expect that non-academic audience can also read and benefit from the book. </details>

   -  <details><summary> Abstract </summary> <br> The Post-Rebel Electoral Parties (PREP) dataset provides longitudinal data on the electoral participation and performance in national elections of political parties formed by armed opposition groups after civil war. Post-rebel electoral parties sit at the center of overlapping research agendas that address how best to build durable peace, and how to build resilient political systems and capable states after devastating conflict. A better understanding of how and why these parties participate in and perform in elections over time is critical to any assessment of liberal peacebuilding. These parties – their strategic choices, organizational development, and impact on the political systems in which they participate – are also relevant to the broader study of comparative democratization, political parties, and party systems. Our dataset follows these parties forward through up to three decades of participation in post-war electoral politics. The current version of the data consists of 77 distinct PREP actors derived from 56 conflict actors. The data cover 321 legislative election years and 215 executive elections in 39 countries over 30 years. This article describes the data and articulates the need for and motivation behind the dataset. We then offer some illustrations of its relevance for advancing research in the study of post-conflict politics. </details>

   - <details><summary> Abstract </summary> <br> Since 1990, multilateral organizations have invested in the idea that multiparty political systems are an essential part of building durable peace, and that former insurgents must be converted to political actors. To what extent does this foster longer term democracy and stability? In this paper, we focus on the role of electoral inclusion for post-rebel parties in the creation of stable party systems as one feature that supports both democratization and durable peace. We find that political integration of former insurgents in electoral politics not only serves the short-term purpose of bringing such groups “inside the tent” and smoothing the transition from war to peace. It also lays a foundation for the creation of stable party systems. We test our propositions with an original dataset and offer explanatory analysis of small set of parties. </details>

   -  <details><summary> Abstract </summary> <br> Since 1990, Western powers and multilateral organizations have invested in the idea that multiparty political systems are an essential part of building durable peace, a core feature of the post-war political order. Yet despite growing interest in rebel-to-party transitions, the long-term party trajectories of these parties, and their implications for the political systems of which they are a part, remain understudied. Our research brief presents a retrospective, longitudinal view on the performance and impact of these parties in the post-war political system. How well have post-rebel parties fared in electoral politics? To what extent has their inclusion and participation in politics over the long term contributed to the establishment of durable political systems? This research brief builds on published research by Carrie Manning and Ian Smith on party participation (Manning and Smith, 2016) and party performance (Manning and Smith, 2019), as well as on new, unpublished research by Manning and Tuncel, which explores the impact of these parties on party system formation. The study of former rebel groups and their transition to politics has grown rapidly in the last decade. In addition to building on our own previous work, our research brief will situate our findings on rebel-to-party transition and performance in the larger body of scholarship on these transitions. For example, scholars have examined the implications of rebel group ideology, rebel governance, and other organizational adaptations on the performance of these parties. Our research brief includes policy-relevant conclusions about how and when the systematic conversion and inclusion of rebel groups into political life in the era of liberal peacebuilding has contributed to a durable political system. </details>

- The glimmer of hope in the bleak future of civil society under oppressive regimes: An example from the Turkish educational civil society. Forthcoming, *Journal of Civil Society.*
  -  <details><summary> Abstract </summary> <br> This article attempts to explain the role of the educational civil society in Turkey, where the regime excessively co-opts and controls associational life while maintaining a veneer of democracy. Despite growing oppression, both liberal and government-friendly civil society organizations are rising in number and quality. Also, the regime is inclusive in terms of the policymaking process. This research shows the role of civil society under repressive competitive autocratic regimes and which mechanisms the state uses in its shifting approach to civil society organizations in policymaking. By addressing a gap in the literature, this article claims that the state co-opts government-friendly civil society organizations and alters existing laws and regulations to create a veneer of democracy. The state continues to include different civil society organizations into the policymaking process because the state’s limited capacity and civil society organizations’ extensive knowledge and expertise give invaluable insight to educational civil society in Turkey. Based on elite interviews of state officials and civil society organizations, and document research, this article can present a glimmer of hope in the bleak future of civil society under oppressive regimes. </details>
