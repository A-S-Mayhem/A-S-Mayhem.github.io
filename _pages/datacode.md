Data and code packets for published papers are either available on the publication website or upon request from my coauthors and I (except when data sharing limitations apply).

### Data
I am currently working on building two historical datasets (data will be made public when first project for each is accepted).
* Historical county-level vehicle registration data in the United States (1900-1960)
* Historical state-level minimum driver license age data (1968-1995)

### Code
Under development. Current project share is a Mata encoding of exposure function Malmendier & Nagel (2011).
