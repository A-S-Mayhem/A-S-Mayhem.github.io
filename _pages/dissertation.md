In my dissertation, I use statistical, network, and computational methods to study how social movements (i.e.,shareholder and stakeholder activism) shape corporate political spending activities and related governance practices. Drawing on data from multiple sources such as CPA, WebSraping (e.g., media reports), and other big administrative records, I attempt to address two sets of questions: 1) Why some U.S. publicly traded companies are targeted by shareholder and stakeholder activism in terms of political spending activities? 2) What are the consequenes of those shareholder and stakeholder activism regarding corporate status and performance?
