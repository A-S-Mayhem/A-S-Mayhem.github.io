My dissertation research addresses the pre-electoral coalitions formed in electoral autocratic regimes. Substantively, I study opposition coordination and the communication between opposition parties and the incumbent both before and after national-level elections. I adopt a mixed-methodological approach - large-N quantitative analysis, causal case selection, and site-intensive methods - to explore how political parties' organizational structures and ideological and political agenda diversity explain opposition bargaining prior to the elections. In testing my theory, I draw on an original dataset on elections in electoral authoritarian regimes and archival materials, interviews with party chairs and co-chairs, and shadowing insights. I focus on Turkey in my fieldwork, but I also explore elections in Armenia, Guatemala, Hungary, and North Macedonia as influential and pathway cases. 

My dissertation research has been supported by the [Warren E. Miller Fund in Electoral Politics](https://connect.apsanet.org/centennialcenter/research-grants/) supported by the APSA Centennial Grant, Craigie Fellowship, and GSU's [Library Dissertation Award](https://graduate.gsu.edu/dissertation-library-travel-awards/).  

My dissertation project is part of a larger substantive research that seeks to understand the role of political parties in democratization and regime change. My methodological agenda is an extension of my substantive interests and is centered around the development of necessary original data and the synthesis of tools to account for complex causal mechanisms to understand how political parties and elites behave.
