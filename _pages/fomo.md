# Pro-tips and bucket lists

I was getting some FOMO the other day and realized that it was in part because I was sad to be missing out on things in Boston, but also that I was sad to not have enough time to do all the cool things I want to on my [road trip](/travel/). So I'm writing them down!

## Arkansas

### Pro-tips

- Ouachita forest: so many rec areas!

### Bucket list

- Just all of it again but slower

## Grand Canyon

### Pro-tips

- Backcountry office is way less busy than the visitor center, it has flush toilets, and parking fills up less quickly than the visitor center
- camp in the forest just outside the park: you won't be alone. If you're not in an RV, have dinner at a picnic area _in_ the park first, stop by a bathroom, and then head to the forest. Don't lock yourself out though.

### Bucket list

- Tanner Trail
- Rim to rim hike
- Bright angel again, but start a bit earlier and go all the way to Plateau Point
- Check out the North rim

## North of Grand canyon/South Grand Escalante, Kanab region

### Pro-tips

- Badger Canyon "camp" is awesome

### Bucket list

- All of it! Spencer Lake trail for next time, but I'd definitely do Cathedral Wash again.
- Buckskin gulch trail (but starting from Wire tap)
- Actually get your shit together to go do The Wave lottery (but remember: Arizona and Utah might be an hour different if it's daylight savings!)
- Maybe the Peek-a-boo slot canyon that's to the west of Kanab?

## Zion National Park

### Bucket list

- as many trails as possible from the East side
- hike through the Narrows (with a friend who knows how to prepare for a hike through a river)

## Bryce Canyon National Park

### Pro-tips

- Bryce Canyon Coffee Co in Tropic is super lovely! Also attached to a motel.
- All of the viewpoints have parking, so if you're early enough in the day you probably don't need to take the shuttle. (It comes every 15 min, so it's not as frequent as in Zion). The additional parking seems to fill up by 10 am or so.

### Bucket list

- If I'm feeling like backpacking: the under-the-rim trail seems awesome.
- If not, figure out what the trail is that leaves from Rainbow Point and goes out to the point in front of it.
- Maybe try to find some hikes in the forest between Bryce and Tropic (or go back and do Red Canyon hike?)
## Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument area

### Pro-tips

- Unlike most other areas I've camped in, this one has no service!

### Bucket list

- Petrified forest state park
