Pro-tips and bucket lists

## Arkansas

### Pro-tips

- Ouachita forest: so many rec areas!

### Bucket list

- Just all of it again but slower

## Grand Canyon

### Pro-tips

- Backcountry office is way less busy than the visitor center, it has flush toilets, and parking fills up less quickly than the visitor center
- camp in the forest just outside the park: you won't be alone. If you're not in an RV, have dinner at a picnic area _in_ the park first, stop by a bathroom, and then head to the forest. Don't lock yourself out though.

### Bucket list

- Tanner Trail
- Rim to rim hike
- Bright angel again, but start a bit earlier and go all the way to Plateau Point
- Check out the North rim

## North of Grand canyon/South Grand Escalante

### Pro-tips

- Badger Canyon "camp" is awesome

### Bucket list

- All of it! Spencer Lake trail for next time, but I'd definitely do Cathedral Wash again.
- Buckskin gulch trail (but starting from Wire tap)
- Actually get your shit together to go do The Wave lottery (but remember: Arizona and Utah might be an hour different if it's daylight savings!)

## Zion National Park

### Bucket list

- as many trails as possible from the East side
- hike through the Narrows (with a friend who knows how to prepare for a hike through a river)
