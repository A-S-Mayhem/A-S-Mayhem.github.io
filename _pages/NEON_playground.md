# Measuring phylogenetic diversity within communities

The main goal of this turorial is to present basic understanding about measuring phylogenetic diversity within communities or best known as the analysis of community phylogenetics. The community phylogenetics integrates ecological and evolutionary concepts and explores the mechanisms (e.g., biotic interactions or environmental filters) governing the assembly of ecological communities.

We will download data of plant communities directly from NEON and to do that we will use the R package {neonUtilities} and the function ‘loadByProduct’. Before proceed let’s take a look at the core information required in this function. To do that you just can type ?loadByProduct in your console and the documentation for this function will appear in the Help window of RStudio.

# Using hyperspectral remote sensing data to predict biodiversity 

In this lab we will explore some aspects of hyperspectral remote sensing obtained from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) with the goal of predicting biodiversity from the sky. Specifically, we will use hyperspectral remote sensing data from the NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) (more information here and here). As you will see, working with hyperspectral information/data is similar to work with any other information/data (e.g., species abundance, presence-absence) and consequently it can be used to calculate any metric of biodiversity. In this sense, spectral diversity can be considered as a dimension of biodiversity.
