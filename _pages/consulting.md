I am currently working as an independent consultant. Areas of expertise include math education, inquiry-based learning, Team-Based Learning, inclusive teaching, and alternative grading.  Some institutions I have worked with recently:

* Illinois State University
* Institue for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation, University of Chicago

I also frequently give workshops/presentations on the aforementioned topics, most often in a faculty development context.  Some recent presentations include:

* Team-Based Inquiry Learning, multi-day workshop
* Promoting Student Learning in Mathematics Courses, 8 hours of content with sessions on Active Learning in Mathematics; Policies and Practices; Collaborative Learning in Mathematics Classrooms; and Assessment for Learning
* Rehumanizing Assessment: Outcomes-Based Grading
