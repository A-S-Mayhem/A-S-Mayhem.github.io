## Exam
---
The exam will take place on **Tuesday, June 25th** from **11:00 - 13:00**. The exam is on location in **Remindo**. The exam makes up **60%** of your grade, with the remainder determined by your grade for homeworks (**20%**) and the group assignment (**20%**).

The exam will test your understanding and comprehension of data analysis theory, methods, and data analysis skills. **Note** that during the exam you will not need to produce R code yourself, but your comprehension of R code (e.g., annotating code) is part of the exam.

Exam material includes the required readings, lecture slides, and materials discussed during labs. As a guideline to which parts of the readings are most important, refer to the topics discussed during the lectures and labs. Material related to “Interactive data visualization” is **not part of the exam**.

Questions will be a combination of:

- Case studies
- Multiple choice questions
- Fill-in-the-blank questions
- A (limited amount of) open questions.

A week before the exam, we will provide you with some **example exam questions** to give you a taste of what the exam will be like. This is not a practice exam, as it will be much shorter than the actual exam and will not cover all topics of the exam.

Grades will be communicated on **Tuesday, July 2nd**, and the retake will take place on **Tuesday, July 9th** from **11:00 - 13:00**.

Note that general rules of the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences for being allowed a resit hold for the **UU wide minor students**, and rules of the **Utrecht University School of Economics** for being allowed a resit hold for the **Economics students**.
