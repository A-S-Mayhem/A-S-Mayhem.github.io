As a sophomore, I encountered huge difficulty in knowing which books or papers should I read when I started researching the history of computing. This field has a limited number of researchers, making it challenging for beginners to obtain sufficient information without taking significant initiative or encountering good fortune (There are only five researchers in this field in Japan...). I decided to write an introductory article for beginners to help those who are struggling, like myself at the time, and to increase awareness of the field of the History of Computing.
