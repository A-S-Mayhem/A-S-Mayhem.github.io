As a sophomore, I encountered huge difficulty in knowing which books or papers I should read when I started researching the history of computing. This field has a limited number of researchers, making it challenging for beginners to obtain sufficient information without taking significant initiative or encountering good fortune. (In Japan, there are about five researchers in this field... I am grateful to my academic adviser for granting me a high level of autonomy and offering me appropriate guidance, despite being far from his expertise.) I decided to write an introductory article for beginners to help those who are struggling, like myself at the time, and to increase awareness of the History of Computing field.  I will provide some comments for someone fluent in Japanese (such as the availability of Japanese translation).


What is the History of Computing
======
Everything has a history.

Like historians in other disciplines who read Latin or Ancient Greek, Historians of Computing should also be familiar with early programming languages such as ALGOL, LISP, and Prolog.

* Journal: *IEEE Annals of the History of Computing*

History of the History of Computing
======
Approximately 50 years have passed since the beginning of this field. If you would like to know more, please check this page.

Introductory/Must-read Books and Papers
======
* *Computer: A History of the Information Machine* 『コンピューティング史』，『コンピュータ200年史』
  * 
  * 『イラストで学ぶ　世界を変えたコンピュータの歴史』
* *A History of Modern Computing* 『モダン・コンピューティングの歴史』
  * The first edition is more technical and focuses on software. 
* Swade, Doron. (2022). *The History of Computing: A Very Short Introduction*
  * I plan to translate this into Japanese

Recommended Books and Papers (I have not kept up with the latest research.)
======
* History of Computer Science
  * 
    * Mahoney, Michael S., edited by Thomas Haigh, *Histories of Computing* (2011). 
    
* History of Theoretical Computer Science (TCS)
    * 
    * Jones, C.B., “The Early Search for Tractable Ways of Reasoning about Programs.” (2003)
  
* Philosophy of Computing
  * 
  * "Philosophy of science without history of science is empty; history of science without philosophy of science is blind." (I. Lakatos, The methodology of scientific research programmes, Philosophical Papers, Vol. 1, 1978, p.102)
  
* History of AI
  * 
  
* Cybernetics
  * 
  * 
    * Gerovitch, Slava, *From Newspeak to Cyberspeak*, (2004). 
      * This book deals with the reception of cybernetics in the Soviet Union. Although the history of cybernetics is complex and difficult to write about, the third chapter of this book provides a complete and clear summary of the history, noting the similarities between Kolmogorov and Wiener. I found the history of science in the Soviet Union fascinating after reading this book.
