Simon Gravel, Principal investigator

<img align="left" src="/images/photo_simon.jpg" style="width:100px;height:160p"/>
I try to understand the relationship between genetic diversity, history, biology, and disease. I often do this through mathematics and statistics, and collaborations with people who know biology, history and anthropology. I am also scientific co-director of the [CARTaGENE cohort](https://cartagene.qc.ca/).
