**Big Bend National Park --> Austin, TX**

Another long driving day today. Managed to stay off of I-10 for a while though, got to see some excellent Texas countryside.

Three excellent things happened today:

1. I had lunch at the Oasis Cafe, where the staff talked to everybody like they knew each other so well. And where the border patrol lady from the checkpoint nearby (where I did stop this time!) came to pick up her milk shakes.

2. Drove _right through_ Fredericksburg without even once thinking about stopping in antique shops. Felt so good. (As a kid, we were often dragged to Fredericksburg to go antique shopping and it was SO BORING OMG)

3. Had a Fast Dryer reunion because Lauren was also in town tonight! Lots of fun reminiscing about high school, realizing all the people (but not names!) that we've forgotten, and being fiercely reminded by Shelby that even if we weren't the greatest musicians, being in an all-girl punk rock band in 8th grade was awesome and brave and we should be proud.

**Big Bend National Park**

I'm actually writing this on the 23rd, and I'm glad I waited a day to do so because now I can paint you a full landscape of solitude.

Most of the day was full of excellent solo hiking. Big Bend is weird because there's a lot of driving to lots of different short hikes, which is especially nice to do alone because it avoids decision fatigue. You just do what you want.

Hiked to the Santa Elena canyon, which my friend-with-the-two-thumbs-up from the other day told me about and added, with a scoff, "build a wall".

<img src="/images/2019/road-trip/2019-02-22_st_elena_canyon.jpg" width="50%">

Did a few other hikes as well on the drive back, loved the feeling of going at exactly my own pace at every moment. Nobody but me and the desert.

<img src="/images/2019/road-trip/2019-02-22_desert_selfie.jpg" width="80%">

Got back to camp, my head hurt and I was feeling very lazy so I decided not to cook a full-on dinner and instead just ate some leftover pasta. Picture the scene: one girl sitting next to her car in the desert in the dark, slicing of some swiss cheese and putting it in her mouth at the same time as cold pasta to make like she was eating pasta with cheese, alone and doing exactly what she felt like doing even if some part of her felt like she _should_ be less lazy and make real food, or like this scene _should_ somehow be sad. In the experience of it: just neutral.

Then I headed to sleep fairly early because of the headache and the long drive ahead of me. It was super windy, so after an hour of feeling like the tent was going to fly away, I decided to pack up and just sleep in my car. Turns out the wind had slid my phone under my mattress and I shattered the screen (big ol' bummer). It was also pretty difficult and nerve-wrecking to pack up the tent in gale force winds without it flying away. Not the greatest. Also not the worst.

**Big Bend National Park**

Did two hikes today in Big Bend, both were supposed to be 3 hours but ended up being more like 1 or 1.5 -- I think Big Bend is tailored more toward the RV crowd than the live-out-of-your-car crowd!

So far, pros of traveling alone:

- You can sleep in exactly how much you want.   
- Packing up camp or moving onto something new can be super fast.   
- You can say your internal monologue out loud and no one has to know.

Cons of traveling alone:

- No one to help you navigate, change the playlist, or look stuff up on the drive.
- Don't have anyone to outsource making decisions to.
- Sometimes you can't open your cayenne pepper to remove the protective seal for your avocado toast.

BUT THAT'S OKAY I don't need no man I'm an independent woman and I figure it out!

Had a good chat with a Polish man at the top of Lost Mines trail (so beautiful!) and then headed to my new campsite for a stupendous sunset.

Sitting in the back of the car, warm weather and beer in hand -- life doesn't get better than this.

**Madera Canyon Trail --> Big Bend National Park!**

Attention everybody, we have had our _first bluebonnet sighting_!!!

<img src="/images/2019/road-trip/2019-02-20_bluebonnet_selfie.jpg" width="50%">

We are indeed truly in Texas.

I drove the ~3 hours left to Big Bend today, and was lucky to find a camping spot in the backcountry for the next few days. I thought Big Bend was supposed to be quiet, but it's basically all full right now - partly due to the nice weather, partly due to the shutdown.

The reason I'm here is that (1) I grew up in Texas and never came here, which is a shame and (2) when people asked me where I wanted to go on my post-PhD roadtrip Big Bend was the first thing that came to mind, and so after a while of repeating it I figured I might as well go for it. Call it a self-fulfilling prophecy, I suppose.

Hung out at some hot springs, got two thumbs up from a retired guy when I told him I was traveling by myself, did a very short hike, and made it to my campsite before dark (for the first time this trip)! Also pretty pumped to be sleeping in my tent, where I can actually sit up straight and starfish all I want! :D

**Indian Bread Rocks --> El Paso, TX --> somewhere between El Paso and Big Bend (Madera Canyon Trail roadside camp)**

Today was a big driving day.

<img src="/images/2019/road-trip/2019-02-19_i-10.jpg" width="80%" alt="blurry but beautiful">

Today's thoughts: I-10 is an amazing beast, New Mexico is amazingly way less amazing than Arizona, highway signs don't fuck around. I now know what to do in case of a dust storm (pull over, turn off car, foot off brake pedal, wait till dust settles). New Mexico does not mess with dust storms. A bit bummed I didn't experience one, tbh.

<img src="/images/2019/road-trip/2019-02-19_welcome_new_mexico.jpg" width="80%">

My favorite highway sign so far: there's a prison in the area, "please" don't pick up hitchhikers. It's the only one that's not yelling at you, like it's reasoning with you and making sure you're both on the same side of the issue.

Turns out Big Bend is really far from things. Also turns out there isn't much BLM land in Texas. Given my lack of preparation, ended the day a bit earlier than the past few days (i.e. around 8 pm instead of 10) at one of the few campgrounds I saw on the app I'm using (FreeRoam) between here and there.

Tomorrow, off to Big Bend!

**Sonoran Desert --> Mesa, AZ --> Indian Bread Rocks camp**

Spent most of today in an extremely suburban coffee shop in Mesa, AZ getting some work done. I thought I was in an apartment complex (I might have been).

Paid homage to my birthplace before leaving:

<img src="/images/2019/road-trip/2019-02-18_mesa_hospital.jpg" width="80%">

Some thoughts. Wow Mesa is so flat and expansive. I can't imagine what it was like for my parents, two Frenchies with two kids, to move here from France. The desert is beautiful though, and I love when Arizona looks like its license plate (which is not that infrequently, as far as I can tell). Must be in my blood.

Had dinner in Tucson, where I realized that it takes an accumulation of 3-4 independent things to get my sketchiness/poverty alarm bells ringing. Today, this was:

1. A man and a woman in a fight on the street, the man yelling after her, as she's walking away from him.    
2. The security guard at the gas station, right by the entrance.    
3. The two security guards at the grocery store, right by the entrance.    
4. There being more Dollar Generals than actual grocery stores. (This was the one that clinched it for me)    

Am trying to get to Big Bend soon, but my timing isn't great and there doesn't seem to be too many BLM campsites between here and there that aren't huge detours.

Because I left Mesa so late, just made it to Indian Bread Rocks BLM campsite tonight, a bit over two hours outside of Tucson. It started raining/snowing on the drive; driving into oncoming rain with your headlights on in the dark feels like being in a wormhole.

**San Diego, CA --> Sonoran Desert National Monument**

It begins!

![](/images/2019/road-trip/2019-02-17_san_diego_departure.jpg)

I flew to San Diego on Wednesday. I finished up some reviewer comments, got everything I need for my trip (except all the things I forgot), and now I'm off.

To catch everybody up: I'm borrowing my parents' car (Subaru Forester XT, 4-wheel drive woop woop) and road tripping around the US.

The plan so far:

- **February**: Leave from San Diego, head straight to Big Bend. Then Austin, New Orleans, and anywhere else on the way back to Boston that's interesting and warm-ish in February.    
- **March**: Go to Malaysia on a sampling trip with the [Global Microbiome Conservancy](http://microbiomeconservancy.org/).     
- **Early April**: Head to New York for the Microbiome Center's workshop and spend a week there visiting friends. Go back to Boston for my Lasik appointment on April 7th.      
- **April -- May**: Drive back to San Diego, this time via Nashville, Memphis, maybe St. Louis, and all the Southwestern and Western parks I can do. Definitely on the list are Badlands, Smoky Mountains, Yellowstone. (Are those even possible to do all on the same trip? No idea. Haven't gotten that far yet). Also Seattle and SF, of course.     
- **June**: Be back in Boston in time for Commencement. Then, probably head off to Europe to see Carolyn, my family, and my friends' wedding in Greece!

I'm hoping to keep this updated during my road trip parts, at least with a photo of where I slept the night before. Maybe I'll also include a selection of thoughts I've had on the road or experiences I had that day. We'll see.

For today, one lulz for you: I accidentally "blew right through" a stop sign at a border patrol checkpoint. Thought it was like at the Mexican border where you just slowly inch your way through but nope, the dude thought I was legit trying to get away from them. "Good thing you stopped," he said, "or there would have been a chase." _Good thing I'm a harmless-looking white girl_, I thought, _though I probably shouldn't push it by taking this moment to put more eye drops in my eyeballs_.

Here's where I slept tonight:
