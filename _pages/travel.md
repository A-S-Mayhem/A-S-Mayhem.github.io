**San Diego, CA to Sonoran Desert National Monument**

It begins!

I flew to San Diego on Wednesday. I finished up some reviewer comments, got everything I need for my trip (except all the things I forgot), and now I'm off.

To catch everybody up: I'm borrowing my parents' car (Subaru Forester XT, 4-wheel drive woop woop) and road tripping around the US.

The plan so far:

- **February**: Leave from San Diego, head straight to Big Bend. Then Austin, New Orleans, and anywhere else on the way back to Boston that's interesting and warm-ish in February.    
- **March**: Go to Malaysia on a sampling trip with the [Global Microbiome Conservancy](http://microbiomeconservancy.org/).     
- **Early April**: Head to New York for the Microbiome Center's workshop and spend a week there visiting friends. Go back to Boston for my Lasik appointment on April 7th.      
- **April -- May**: Drive back to San Diego, this time via Nashville, Memphis, maybe St. Louis, and all the Southwestern and Western parks I can do. Definitely on the list are Badlands, Smoky Mountains, Yellowstone. (Are those even possible to do all on the same trip? No idea. Haven't gotten that far yet). Also Seattle and SF, of course.     
- **June**: Be back in Boston in time for Commencement. Then, probably head off to Europe to see Carolyn, my family, and my friends' wedding in Greece!

I'm hoping to keep this updated during my road trip parts, at least with a photo of where I slept the night before. Maybe I'll also include a selection of thoughts I've had on the road or experiences I had that day. We'll see.

For today, one **lulz** for you: I accidentally "blew right through" a stop sign at a border patrol checkpoint. Thought it was like at the Mexican border where you just slowly inch your way through but nope, the dude thought I was legit trying to get away from them. "Good thing you stopped," he said, "or there would have been a chase." _Good thing I'm a harmless-looking white girl_, I thought, _though I probably shouldn't push it by taking this moment to put more eye drops in my eyeballs_.

Here's where I slept tonight:
