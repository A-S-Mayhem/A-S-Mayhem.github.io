---------------------
The lab explores questions related to foreign aid, climate change, and international political economy. Currently, team members are digitizing historical World Bank documents to create a database of all proposed projects from 1955 to 2021. The project aims to use the full sample of projects to understand key selection issues in aid. 

Students interested in joining the lab should email <a href= "coudry@illinois.edu">Dr. Cleo O'Brien-Udry</a> with a short description of their interest and CV.


Current team members:
