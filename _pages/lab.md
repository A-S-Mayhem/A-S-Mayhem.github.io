---------------------
The lab explores questions related to foreign aid, climate change, and international political economy. Currently, team members are digitizing historical World Bank documents to create a database of all proposed projects from 1955 to 2022. Tasks include: systemic digitization of documents, cleaning and merging existing data, historical research on selected aid projects, and network analyses of associated bureaucrats. The project aims to use the full sample of projects to understand key selection issues in aid.
