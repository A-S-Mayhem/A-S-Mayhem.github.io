<p>This is a map of all the places where I've been professionally. The color of each marker specifies what I've done in each place: an <span style="color:#CA2C28">invited talk</span>, a <span style="color:#2981CA">contributed talk</span>, a <span style="color:#CB6B2B">poster</span>, an <span style="color:#2BB7CB">event</span> that I have attended (like a workshop or a seminar where I haven't given any talk or poster), or a <span style="color:#6C28CA">visiting period</span>. Click any marker for more information.<br>
Click any cluster to zoom and expand it<!--, and use the layer control menu to select which category to show:-->.</p>
