I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University's Engineering Science (ENSC) department, deeply passionate about research in deep learning and computer vision. Currently, I am dedicated to exploring the intersections of Information Theory and Deep Learning, with a specific focus on developing learned image codecs for machines. I am experienced in Python programming, both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks, and have been actively engaged with neural networks since 2016.

My research interests include:

* Object Detection and Segmentation
* Learned Image and Video Compression
* Scalable Image Codecs for Humans and Machines


I engage in diverse hobbies and passions. I go to gym three times a week for a dynamic mix of weightlifting and TRX, nurturing both my fitness and overall well-being. I find satisfaction in solving puzzles, as a mental exercise and also a source of enjoyment. While I once immersed myself in crime and mystery movies, due to scarcity of finding one, I switched to historical documentaries and podcasts, with a particular focus on the World War II and Cold War eras.

Sure, I'll try to write a text with my suggestions. Here is a possible version:

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University's Engineering Science (ENSC) department, deeply passionate about research in deep learning and computer vision. I chose to pursue a Ph.D. in this field because I believe it has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our society, such as healthcare, education, entertainment, and security. My career goal is to become a leading researcher and innovator in this domain and contribute to the advancement of science and technology.

Currently, I am dedicated to exploring the intersections of Information Theory and Deep Learning, with a specific focus on developing learned image codecs for machines. I am experienced in Python programming, both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks, and have been actively engaged with neural networks since 2016.

My research interests include:

* Object Detection and Segmentation
* Learned Image and Video Compression
* Scalable Image Codecs for Humans and Machines

Some of the projects that I have worked on or contributed to are:

* A novel method for object detection and segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms.
* A state-of-the-art learned image compression system that outperforms JPEG 2000 and BPG in terms of rate-distortion performance.
* A scalable image codec that can adaptively encode and decode images for different devices and applications using a single bitstream.
