I am a medical doctor, a clinical epidemiologist, and a public health specialist. I received a medical degree from the University of Medicine, Mandalay in 2002, a Master of Medical Science in Public Health (with distinction in Biostatistics) from the University of Medicine, Mandalay in 2007, a Ph.D. in Clinical Epidemiology from the Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, the Mahidol University of Thailand in 2017 (with a full scholarship from the Mahidol-Norway Capacity Building Initiative for ASEAN (CBIA)), and a Diploma in Medical Education from the University of Public Health, Yangon in 2019.

Most of my responsibilities at Medical Universities involve teaching Preventive and Social Medicine, Community Medicine, and Research Methodology, Biostatistics, and Critical Appraisal to Postgraduate Medica Students at Health and Health-Aligned Universities. Supervising my students' research proposals and evaluating their theses are also among my primary responsibilities. Assisting numerous postgraduate students with data analysis, thesis and dissertation writing, and manuscript creation is also one of my primary responsibilities. To ensure the ethical conduct of research, I have also reviewed numerous studies from a variety of disciplines for ethical approval. To expand my professional network, I collaborate on research projects with other medical-related departments locally and internationally. I was also trained as a Quality Assurance Assessor for the University's Quality Unit Team, where I reviewed and revised some curricula to conform to global trends.
Biostatistics, data science, evidence-based medicine, systematic review, and research ethics are among my main interests. My research interests include noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer), pregnancy outcomes, maternal and child health, personal development, and productivity. Many of my colleagues refer to me as an IT/computer genius because I have outstanding strengths in this area and am proficient in statistical software (Stata, SPSS, R, Python). With my IT talent, I am constantly sharing my knowledge about research, statistics, EBM, and productivity through my self-developed websites [mebm.net](www.mebm.net), [mebm.org](www.mebm.org), [winedu.me](www.winedu.me), and my [MEBM YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MEBMCARE4u). As part of my volunteer charity activities, I am currently running an international bestseller review in Sandi's Education Reader's Club, where we review one book each month. I also share my knowledge of R statistics every week under the title "Myanmar Learners to R (MLTR)" through social media channels. I share all this with my younger colleagues and all medical professionals and business students. I have extensive experience in public health, epidemiology, biostatistics, evidence-based medicine, student supervision, and medical research. I received training in EBM teaching methods from Professor Gordon Guyatt, a famous EBM pioneer. Now I teach EBM and critical appraisal (CARE - Critical Appraisal of Research Evidence) to many health professionals, both in person and virtually through the online classroom.
I continually update myself by enrolling in courses on Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Future Learn, and a variety of free and paid online webinars. I believe that continuous learning is essential for all academics because, as Henry Ford once said, “anyone who stops learning is old, whether they are twenty or eighty. Whoever continues to learn remains young”. I strongly agree with Albert Einstein’s statement that intellectual development should begin at birth and end at death.
I have a strong interest in the scientific method and in research. My interest in examining the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease in patient populations, as well as my passion, has motivated the links between exposures or treatments and health outcomes for this area of research. In addition, I have developed a sharp eye for correctness and efficiency in research thanks to my expertise in the teaching of public health, epidemiology, biostatistics, and evidence-based medicine (EBM), as well as in supervising students and taking part in medical research.
