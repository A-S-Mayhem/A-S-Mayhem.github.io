I work on the development of global models (GEOS-Chem and GTMM), and apply these models to study the fate of anthropogenic emissions mercury in the environment. If you'd like to chat about science, or want a PDF of a paper, please let me know!

__Currently active projects include:__

- Characterizing trends in mercury emissions from the U.S. power sector and associated human health impacts
- Developing a second generation global model of terrestrial mercury accumulation and exchange with the atmosphere
- Investigating the factors controlling rates of mercury preservation in marine sediment
