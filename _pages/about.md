I am a fifth year computer science PhD student at GESIS, Leibnitz Institute for the Social Sciences and RWTH-Aachen, with Prof. Claudia Wagner at the Computational Social Science (CSS) Department. Through natural language processing, and measurement theory, my research focuses on how researchers and policy makers can draw better and more transparent insights from digital trace data.


Before my PhD at GESIS, I obtained my Master's in Computer Science from IIIT Delhi, working with Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru at Precog, where I was also a research assistant. And even before that, I did my Bachelor's (also in CS) in Vellore Institute of Technology.
