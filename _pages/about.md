I recently recieved my Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences with a Concentration in Cognitive Neuroscience from the [Department of Cognitive Sciences](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/) at the University of California Irvine. I am a member of the [Spatial Neuroscience Lab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/lab-members/). My advisor is [Prof. Elizabeth R. Chrastil](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/) and my research focuses on [human navigation and spatial cognition](https://lilianyou.github.io/portfolio/). I also work with [Prof. Jeffrey Krichmar](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~jkrichma/) on computational neuroscience modeling.

I received my B.S. in Psychology from [South China Normal University](http://psy.scnu.edu.cn/english/), M.A. in Geography from [the University of California Santa Barbara](https://geog.ucsb.edu/), and M.S. in Cognitive Neuroscience from the [University of California Irvine](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/). My transdisciplinary background enables me to think about research questions across different scales.

Outside of research, I am a science communication advocator. As an active member (and the former co-chair of the adult outreach committee) of the [UCI Center for Neurobiology of Learning and Memory Ambassador Program](https://cnlm.uci.edu/ambassadors/), I promote events to help people in the Irvine community to learn more about neuroscience. I am also passionate about data science and science communication. During graduate school, I was a [data science project instructor](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/you-lilian-cheng) at Coursera teaching interactive and fun guided projects to global learners.

I go by Lily :)
