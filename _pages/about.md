# About me [[My CV_CN](https://github.com/Luoxd1996/Luoxd1996.github.io/blob/master/files/xiangdeluo_cv.pdf)]
* I am a 2-nd year Ph.D. student in the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Guotai Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z2sFN4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Shaoting Zhang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=oiBMWK4AAAAJ&hl=en). 
* My research mainly focuses on the area of medical image analysis, particularly in data-efficient learning for medical image computing, such as semi-supervised learning, weakly-supervised learning and human-in-the-loop, as well as extending them for clinical applicable use.
* I received my Bachelor Degree in the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), on July 1, 2018.
<!--* Now, I am seeking for a research internship position about medical image segmentation during 2021.06-2021.10, feel free to contact me! [[My CV](https://github.com/Luoxd1996/Luoxd1996.github.io/blob/master/files/xiangdeluo_cv.pdf)]-->
