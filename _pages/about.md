I am currently undertaking my second year of Ph.D in Machine Learning at Sorbonne Université. 
I work within the departement of statistics (LPSM) under the supervision of Claire Boyer (Sorbonne-Université) and Erwan Scornet (Ecole Polytechnique).

My research is focused on the theoretical aspects of ML. I am particularly interested in studying Neural Networks from an interpretability perspective. More generally, I am very enthusiastic about deep neural networks seen as either mathematical objects or practical tools.
