I am a first year PhD student at National University of Singapore under A-STAR SINGA programme. I am co-advised by Nancy Chen from A-STAR / I2R and Min Yen Kan from NUS / SoC. I am interested in working with text data, especially the conversational ones. Some specific topics I am focusing on currently are reading comprehension and summarization on dialogue data. Previously I got my Bachelors in Bilkent University in Computer Science and also worked part-time for a year in Milsoft as a software engineer.

Apart from my academic studies, I like to read Japanese literature and sci-fi / fantasy novels. I also like to play board games (Battle Line, Catan, The Resistance and Puerto Rico are among my favorites).
