I am a recent graduate from Georgia Tech having completed my MS in CS with a specialisation in Machine Learning. I am currently working in Prof Srijan Kumar's CLAWS lab as a research engineer/external researcher. My research interests lie broadly in the intersection of understanding social media, machine learning, and social good, with an emphasis on natural language processing.  

At my time at GeorgiaTech, I worked on projects on using AI to generate a recommendation system for background music based on image and video clips to using self-supervised learning for reconstruction of MRI images. 

Previously, I have interned at Amazon as an Software Developement Engineer, where I developed an end-to-end product to compare and identify loss of data in changing file formats. 

As an undegrad from Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering in Mumbai, India, my final project was using Generative AI to create a story and it's respective visual representation. I was heavily involved with 'Unicode' a collegiate group that aimed at mentoring 2nd and 3rd year CS students on web and app development and project management. 

I love to write, having been a part of my school and college editorials, I finally started publishing some of my writings on substack. I love to read and would love if you recommend books that have made you (and can make me) cry. I love the outdoors and spent a good chunk of my summer in Seattle hiking. I document my hikes/days on my instagram page, which apart from a take on my name, is also something (a habit of saying yes in order to represent a taste for adventure) that I am trying to inculcate in my life. 

I'd love to chat, get your advice on research, future directions, discuss my work, writings and coffee. I am a huge Taylor Swift fan, and would love to sing along!
