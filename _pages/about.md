# Hello! I'm Charlie.

I'm a doctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University, currently completing my Ph.D. My dissertation explores how to automate programming feedback using open-source language models, with a focus on supporting novice programmers in large-scale learning environments.

The broader goal is to move beyond systems that depend on large language models and instead build lightweight, locally deployable tools powered by small models. These systems are designed to assist teaching teams by identifying, explaining, and helping correct issues in student code—especially in settings where individual feedback is hard to scale.

To develop effective solutions, I draw inspiration from how teaching assistants interact with students: giving hints, nudging thinking, and fostering conceptual understanding. My work blends technical methods (e.g., reinforcement learning, program repair, small-model fine-tuning) with insights from programming education.

## A Bit of Background

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Aalto University, where I focused on intelligent systems (AI/ML). My master’s thesis, conducted with the [LeTech](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/LeTech/) research group, used data mining and predictive modeling to understand learning behavior in online programming courses. That work underscored how struggling with programming assignments is one of the strongest predictors of dropout—reinforcing the importance of timely, intelligent feedback.

From my time as a teaching assistant in programming courses, I’ve seen firsthand how challenging it is to support every student. This challenge continues to drive my research.
