I am a master student under the supervision of [Associate Prof.Xiuhua Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiuhua-Li-2). My research interests are mainly in deep learning applications in agriculture, including crop disease diagnosis, disease image generation, 3-dimensional point cloud segmentation and crop phenotype extraction, remote sensing image segmentation and object detection. I am also passionate about open source projects, project details can be found on [my Github page](https://github.com/dbcopper).
