I am currently a Ram√≥n Y Cajal Fellow at the Faculty of Political Science and Law at the University of Barcelona. 

Research
======
My research covers three main areas: Protest, interest groups and collective action; agenda dynamics and political representation; and methodological innovation. [My last research project on political organisations and policy processes](https://ccristancho.github.io/rrigo/) uses data from social media and parliamentary records in a comparative perspective. I use computational linguistics, machine learning and network analysis to address core questions on inequalities and influence processes of interest groups and social movement organizations through the study of language in the parliamentary arena and social media platforms.


Teaching
======
I have experience in teaching political behaviour with an emphasis on collective action, political attitudes, and public opinion; political sociology, concentrating mostly on organizations in politics; public policy with a focus on agenda dynamics; research methods, and applied statistics at the introductory and intermediate level on multiple subfields. 
I also teach computational methods for text and network analyses techniques as well as R language courses. I regularly teach short seminars on applied data science for multiple universities and research centres in social sciences, data journalism, entrepreneurship, or social activism.
