Under Construction!!!&#128679;
======
* I will update this website by late August&#128583;.

Hi there! I am a research student in [the Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/) at the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04) in Japan (*Please note that the university will be renamed [the Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) on October 1, 2024). Before joining Tokyo Tech, I majored in History and Philosophy of Science and minored in Computer Science at [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). I am recently interested in program analysis, type systems, computational effects, and building compilers. I am applying to graduate programs in computer science for the 2025 cycle. Here is my CV (This is an [old version](http://yudaiurabe.github.io/files/20241106YudaiUrabe_CV.pdf). I will upload a new one soon!).


Miscellaneous
======
* The Purpose of this Website
  * My background differs from that of typical computer science students, so I will introduce myself through this website (When I first encountered the terms 'monad' and 'type theory' during my junior year at university, I initially associated them with Leibniz and Russell&#128579; The former has little to do with Leibniz, while the latter was conceived by Russell). Although I also love alone time, as an ambivert, I really enjoy interacting with other people as well. I hope this site, which I created for the first time, will help me to interact with various people in graduate school.
  
* I have been interested in extracting essential structures from complex objects (like systems, programs, societies, and natural languages), and the elucidating underlying premises.\\
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Like a mechanic deconstructing a machine into its parts, I liked to deconstruct abstract objects such as theories and concepts to grasp their structure. I was also interested in the **premise** of how and when each deconstructed idea was conceived. In particular, I was interested in how the "established" theories and technologies we learn about in classes and textbooks, such as automata, Turing machines, program semantics, compilers, and operating systems, were originally conceived (The original ideas were not as organized as what we see in textbooks today!). Then, I conducted research on the history and philosophy of science (especially the history and philosophy of computer science).\\
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In the process, I audited classes on functional languages and automata theory, which strongly attracted me to the mathematical aspects of computers, and I became interested in the basic principles and structures of computers and programming languages (I was particularly fascinated by the property of automata that can describe infinity with finite descriptions). Though much attention has been paid to what programs to write in recent years, as a person who is concerned with **premises**, I was particularly interested in programming languages as tools necessary for writing programs and expressing ideas. (I think this is similar to Wittgenstein's interest in language). What captivates me the most about PL is the amalgamation of both the engineering aspect—writing and implementing code—and the scientific aspect—rigorously employing mathematics and logic to write proofs.
    
* What I believe is important
  * The various experiences of the last year have made me believe that while knowledge and skills are important, emotional and social intelligence may be even more crucial in conducting research. This includes respecting others, asking for help, maintaining intellectual independence, making a continuous effort, being self-motivated, having a positive attitude, and being adaptable to change.
