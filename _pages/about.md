I am an **[Old Dominion University](https://online.odu.edu/) undergraduate senior majoring in computer science**. I am also enrolled in Old Dominion University’s [B.S.C.S. & M.S. program in Computer Science](https://www.odu.edu/academics/programs/linked/computer-science), where I expect to graduate with my bachelor’s degree in Spring 2024 and my master’s degree in Spring 2025. As a member of the Old Dominion University [Perry Honors College](https://www.odu.edu/honors), I maintain an overall GPA of 3.94 and a departmental GPA of 3.93.

Technology, the exploration of different cultures, and continual learning have always been central to my life.  I thrive on the excitement of generating creative and innovative solutions within a collaborative setting while continually learning from others and my own experiences.

In December 2023, I began organizing for two local Southwest Florida Meetup communities, [Python SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/pythonswfl/) and the [Tech Alliance of SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/techallianceswfl/).

I am passionate about technology, community, travel, concerts, and mastering Spanish!
