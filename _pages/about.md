I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Bordeaux School of Economics (Univ. Bordeaux). I was a Fulbright visiting student at UC - Berkeley in 2022-2023 and the University of Georgia in 2021.

My research focus on understanding the constraints preventing quality-upgrading in local agricultural value-chain in sub-Sahara Africa context. I work on topics related to technology adoption, crops quality, and social protection.
