I am a computational social scientist in the Political Science and Law Department at Universitat de Barcelona (Ramón y Cajal research fellow 2023-2027). My research covers topics related to protest politics and interest groups. I use computational linguistics, network analysis, and experimental and survey data to address core questions on representation, inequalities, and influence processes in Europe and Latin America.

[My research project on rhetorical influence, political organisations and policy processes](https://ccristancho.github.io/rrigo/) uses data from social media and parliamentary records in a comparative perspective.
