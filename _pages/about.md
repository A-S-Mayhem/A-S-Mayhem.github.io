<!-- I am a Researcher at Microsoft. I obtained my Ph.D. from the College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS), University of Massachusetts, Amherst under the supervision of Prof. Alexandra Meliou (Ph.D. Dissertation). My primary area of research revolves around data management; but, the application areas of my research have been interdisciplinary, spanning from program synthesis and software engineering to machine learning, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. I am interested in designing mechanisms for enhancing system usability and developing intelligent tools towards boosting productivity for a diverse group of users, ranging from end users to data scientists and developers. -->

I am a PhD Candidate @ Purdue University.
