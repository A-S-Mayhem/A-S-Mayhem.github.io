Welcome! I am a post-doctoral researcher in computational molecular biophysics,  part of the Biophysics of Complex Systems team at Institut des Sciences Analytiques, France. 


My motivation is to understand how biomolecular function emerges from structural dynamics by describing the atomically-detailed mechanisms. For this, I combine molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, and experimental biophysics. 



Topics I am working on include:

- Structural basis for energy conversion by molecular motors, such as myosin or ATP synthase
- Mechanism of Pi release by actin filaments
- Function of intrinsically disordered proteins involved in bacterial resistance to silver-based antibiotics
- Structural dynamics and surface immunogenic sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
