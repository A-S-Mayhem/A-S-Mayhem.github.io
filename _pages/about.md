I am a [Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow](https://ppfp.caltech.edu) in [Dr. Richard Murray](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page)'s lab at Caltech. My research uses a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to improve cell-free protein expression systems for synthetic cell operations. Before joining Caltech, I obtained my Ph.D. from [Dr. Mark Styczynski](https://sites.gatech.edu/styczynski/)'s lab at Georgia Tech, where I focused on developing cell-free biosensors for point-of-care diagnostics. I earned my B.Sci. in Chemical Engineering from Cornell University, where I was first introduced to synthetic biology in [Dr. Julius Lucks](https://luckslab.org)'s lab, focused on developing RNA-based genetic regulators. Please refer to the [Publications page](https://yzhang952.github.io/Publications.html) for more details about my research background.

My long-term research interest is to use cell-free synthetic biology to advance diagnostics and medical treatments, particularly in the topics of:
-	Cell-free proteomics
-	Self-assembly
-	Point-of-need deployment
If any of these interest you for collaboration, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to me at yz473@caltech.edu or any of the social media platforms listed.
