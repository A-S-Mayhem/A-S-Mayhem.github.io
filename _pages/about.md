I am a first year doctoral student in Health Policy at UC Berkeley. My research works towards improvements in health equity and addressing health disparities, especially those related to race/ethnicity and income. 

To achieve this, I draw from theoretical perspectives from the social sciences and leverage methods from health policy, health services research, and economics. My current work focuses on the social safety in provision of health services as well as policy solutions to medical debt.
