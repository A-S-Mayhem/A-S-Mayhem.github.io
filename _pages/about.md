About me
======
Hi there! Iâ€™m Sahana Anand, an engineer with an interest for all things automotive and embedded systems. I have recently completed my Masterâ€™s in Mechatronics and Cyber-Physical Systems, and Iâ€™m now diving even deeper into research (probably, with my PhD, not sure yet!!). Currently looking for oppurtunities to grow.

Iâ€™ve always been curious about how things work, especially when it comes to cars and smart systems. Over the years, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in the automotive industry, working on projects like Driver Monitoring Systems and automated parking assistance simulations. I also enjoy exploring exciting areas like machine learning, computer vision, and radar signal processing.

Beyond my professional life, I love tinkering with microcontrollers (yes, I have an STM32 at home!) and taking on hobby projects that challenge me to learn something new. Whether itâ€™s building an object detection system or simulating autonomous parking, I find so much joy in turning ideas into reality.

Right now, Iâ€™m excited about my research journey, which focuses on blending AI with automotive systems to make vehicles smarter and safer. My dream is to contribute to the future of autonomous driving and see how technology can transform the way we move.

When Iâ€™m not busy coding or experimenting, you can find me learning German (Iâ€™m at B1 level!), exploring new tools, or just relaxing with a good book or some music.

Feel free to check out my projects and drop me a message(email, in this case) if youâ€™d like to connectâ€”Iâ€™m always open to collaborations! ðŸ˜Š

#Selected Projects
======
