I am an MD-PhD student in Computational Biology and Biomedical Informatics at the Center for Biomedical Informatics under the direction of Neil Sarkar. He holds an Sc.B. from Brown University in Applied Mathematics. My research interests focus on the development of biomedical informatics methods that leverage population-level data to improve the accuracy of cardiovascular disease risk estimation. My work aims to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines, enhance the precision of preventative medical therapies, better explain observed health outcome disparities in racial and ethnic minority populations, and develop mechanisms for translating omics research into clinical medical practice.

Before returning to Brown, I spent two years as part of the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital working to understand cardiovascular pathophysiology including heart failure using exercise as a physiologic probe. Among other projects, I demonstrated that increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure relative to cardiac output during exercise predicts exercise capacity and heart failure outcomes.
