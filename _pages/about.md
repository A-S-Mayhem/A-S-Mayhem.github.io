I am a PHD student supervised by [Michael Greenspan](https://www.ece.queensu.ca/people/M-Greenspan/index.html) at [RCVLab](https://rcvlab.engineering.queensu.ca/), ECE, Queen's University at Kingston. I am currently working on a research project on the topic of 6DoF Pose estimation for robotics bin picking. My hobbies are traveling and traditional Chinese instrument [Erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu).
