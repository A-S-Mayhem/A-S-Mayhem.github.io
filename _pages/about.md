I hold more than 3 years of experience on embedded systems and signal processing techniques in Bioelectronics and 
Medical Devices. I commit myself to the development of human technology in the field of bioelectronics, medical devices,
aerospace and specially, the application of signal processing techniques and evolution of modern electronics. 

I started my professional career as a research engineer in the microelectronics laboratory (MeLAB) at the University of 
Glasgow, where I worked on the European HERMES project. There I was responsible for the electronic design, simulation 
and fabrication of an implantable brain device. Later, I was part of the Microelectronics Institute of Seville 
belonging to CSIC where I worked on signal processing techniques for the treatment of epilepsy using 
Microelectrode Array (MEA) signal recordings. I currently hold the position of firmware and electronics developer at 
Analog Devices Inc. in the Medical Products group of the Digital Healthcare division. 

I began my PhD in September 2020 at the National Centre of Microelectronics of Seville, in Spain, as part of The Group 
of Neuromorphic Systems, under the supervision of Dr Teresa Serrano-Gotarredona and Bernabe Linares Barranco. 
My project falls under the research of algorithms, circuits and adaptative systems to be integrated on biological 
tissue and detection, analysis and pattern detection of epilepsy seizures. 

I am a very proactive person, always open to collaboration and expand my knowledge. I quickly adapt to new scenarios
and environments. I am a fast-paced and constant learner. My academic experience has strengthened my communication 
skills, not only for presentation but for logical conversation, debates and solutions to conflicts. I have been an
international reviewer for more than three years in IEEE international conferences and published in international 
journals.
