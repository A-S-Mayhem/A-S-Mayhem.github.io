I am currently studying Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Imam Khomeini International University (IKIU) pursuing an undergraduate degree. I am majoring in Software Engineering (SE) with strong enthusiasm and knowledge for Machine Learning (especially Data/Web/Video Mining). Also, I have a solid background in Web Development, especially Front-End Development.

As a student of an international university, I have repeatedly been exposed to new cultures and diverse groups of people. This has made me able to quickly adapt to changes and gain a broader perspective. I am always curious about things and enjoy learning/researching. I like twiddling and solving problems and fixing errors. Also, I am a detail-oriented person and I keep my aims and tasks organized to maintain productivity. Also, I do love doing researches about leading technologies and trends in the field of Computer Science.

I believe that the skills that I have attained from the dynamic and competitive work environment and university life define me. I am looking forward to implementing and polishing them in any further opportunities that I receive.
