Hello! I'm a PhD candidate at Georg-August Universität Göttingen with the Research Training Group 2636: Form-meaning mismatches. My project "The semantics of plural morphology in select Niger-Congo; Kwa languages" investigates the plural morphology and it's relation to the mass-count distinction in Asante Twi, Logba, and Avatime.
