## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Zihan Zhang (in Chinese, å¼ æ¢“æ¶µ). I'm a third-year [Industry Doctorate Program (IDP)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/graduate-research/future-research-students/uts-research-degrees/industry-doctorate-program) PhD student at theÂ [University of Technology Sydney (UTS) NLP group](https://utsnlp.github.io/), sponsored by the industry partner [TPG Telecom](https://www.tpgtelecom.com.au/). I am privileged to be supervised byÂ [Prof. Ling Chen](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Ling.Chen),Â [Dr Mo Namazi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mo-namazi/?originalSubdomain=au), andÂ [Distinguished Prof. Jie Lu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Jie.Lu). I am also working closely with [A/Prof. Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io/) from the University of Liverpool. 
I work at TPG Telecom as a **Research Analyst** in the Data and Analytics Centre of Excellence (CoE) team.
Prior to joining UTS, I obtained my Master degree in Software Engineering from the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/).

I have broad research interests centred around natural language processing (NLP). I am particularly passionate about developing NLP systems that are **practical**, **robust**, **efficient**, and can be applied in the industry.
While working at TPG Telecom, I had the chance to apply my skills in solving **real-world business challenges** involving millions of telco data volumes. Specifically, I developed:

- [Clustering-based topic modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09874) to help the Call Centre team find top topics from millions of customer feedback/comments (NPS) to improve service.
- An efficient [data annotation method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14513) for labelling raw dialogue state data, which is
- Market Offer Engine 


Recently, my research has focused on 

While studying Software Engineering, I have gained skills in designing, modelling, and building software applications, especially web applications. Check out previous ðŸ”¨ software applications I built with my teammates if you are interested.
