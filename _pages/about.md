Hello, my name is Marcus Torres and I am a PhD Student in Political Science at the [Universidade Federal de Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/politica). Also, I am [BITTS Catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/people/marcus-torres/).

My PhD project is about the impact of Political Dynasties in social policy outcomes in Brazil. However I have focused many research years about local health public policy in Brazil, and more recently, Non State Actors actions in local social policies.  

If you feel interested about my research, here is my [CV](cv.pdf)
