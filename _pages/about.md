I am a first year doctoral student in Health Policy (Population and Data Science Track) at UC Berkeley. My research works towards improvements in health equity and addressing health disparities, especially those related to race/ethnicity and income. 

To achieve this, I draw from theoretical perspectives from the social sciences and leverage methods from health policy, health services research, and economics. My current work focuses on provider markets and competition, quality of care for Medicaid patients, and medical debt.
