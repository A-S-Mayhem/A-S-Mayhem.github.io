Welcome to my portfolio site. I'm interested in geoscience and data science, this site shows a few of the projects I've been working on in Python and R! [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Reclassification
======
The object of this project was to create and use a custom class in Python. I created a class to seperate lakes in New Hampshire from those under 1 sq km from those over 1 sq km.
[Lakes](https://github.com/kmp24/kmp24.github.io/blob/master/files/lakeclasses.md) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
