I am currently studying my M.Sc. in data science and engineering at [DAUIN](https://www.dauin.polito.it/), [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en). I completed my B.Sc. in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer engineering at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). I have research experience in spiking neural networks, deep reinforcement learning, computer vision, and brain-computer interface (BCI). My current areas of interests are bio-plausible and brain-inspired learning, neural networks and computational neuroscience, and reinforcement learning and computational cognitive science.

For more details about my academic background and projects, please check out my [CV](https://hafezgh.github.io/cv/cv.pdf), [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JCLX6oYAAAAJ&hl=en), and [GitHub page](https://github.com/hafezgh) or send me an [email](mailto:hafez.ghaemi@studenti.polito.it).
