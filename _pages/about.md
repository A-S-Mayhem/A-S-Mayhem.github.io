Biographical sketch
======
I am an interdisciplinary behavioral scientist and evolutionary anthropologist. Currently I am a Research Fellow at [The Institute for Advanced Studies in Toulouse](http://www.iast.fr/people/zachary-garfield?tab=bio-and-research-interests) and maintain an affiliation at Washington State University as Adjunct Faculty in the [Department of Anthropology](https://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/people/zgarfield/). I am also co-director of the [Omo Valley Research Project](http://www.omovalleyresearchproject.org). 


I received a B.A. with highest distinction in anthropology and psychology from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 2012 and completed my Ph.D. in evolutionary anthropology at WSU in 2019.

Research statement
======
My research program focuses on uncovering interactions between individual behavioral strategies and group dynamics in the context of cultural transitions. In particular, I investigate how behaviors such as leadership and followership, decision-making, and economic strategies are related to group-level pressures such as network dynamics, sociopolitical structures, social contexts, and cultural norms. I am especially interested in how relationships between these individual-level and group-level forces vary across populations and across time. I draw on adaptationist, behavioral-ecological, and cultural-evolutionary theoretical frameworks.

A broader focus my research program includes understanding how remote, minority ethnic populations with limited market integration navigate increasing pressures from state-level influences and maintain or adapt long-standing and more traditional components of their social, cultural, and economic livelihoods. The ultimate goal of my research program is to develop more robust, generalizable theories of human behavior, social organization, and cultural change which are supported and tested through solid empirical foundations.

Field research
------
I have conducted fieldwork in Southwest Ethiopia since 2015. I have worked with the [Chabu forager-horticulturalists](https://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/people/zgarfield/chabu-forager-horticulturalists-sheka-forest/) in the Sheka forests investigating traditional and contemporary systems of leadership among women and men in this relatively egalitarian society.

Currently, my field research is focused on developing the [Omo Valley Research Project](http://www.omovalleyresearchproject.org) (OVRP), which I co-direct with colleague Dr. Luke Glowacki. <img align="right" src="/images/OVRP-logo-Black-500px.png"> The Omo Valley is one of the most culturally diverse areas in the world. The OVRP was established in 2019 and is building a large-scale data set from multiple ethnolinguistic groups for comparative and longitudinal social, biological, and health research.

The OVRP is an interdisciplinary non-profit scientific organization focused on 1) understanding cultural change and diversity in human social organization and behavior and 2) facilitating education, conservation, and philanthropy across Southwest Ethiopia.

Scientific phiolosophies
------
* I value quantitative multidisciplinary approaches in the evolutionary human sciences, built upon sound theoretical foundation. I support open science and the coupling of confirmatory and exploratory analytic approaches. 

* The opportunity to collect observational and empirical data from culturally diverse, subsistence-based populations is rapidly diminishing and should therefore be a top priority of the social sciences. 

* Anthropologists are uniquely situated to be meaningful allies as rural and indigenous populations navigate their changing worlds. 

* Contemporary field research can be informed by comparative results and evolutionary scientists should strive to draw on broad phylogenetic perspectives, across cultures and species. The ethnographic record is an indispensable tool for testing predictions and generating theory about the diversity and universality of our species.

* The evolutionary human sciences will be strengthened by increased integration, synthesizing adaptationist, behavioral-ecological, and cultural-evolutionary frameworks.
