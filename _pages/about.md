I'm a Masters student in Political Science at the University of Copenhagen. I work as a Research Assistant at Aarhus University, where I work on the project "The New Politics of the Housing Market", which is led by Associate Professor [Martin Vin√¶s Larsen] (https://www.martinvlarsen.com/). In the Spring of 2023, I was a Visiting Student Research Collaborator at [The Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice] (https://bobst.princeton.edu/) and the [Department of Politics] (https://politics.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University] (https://www.princeton.edu/).

My research interests lie in welfare state development, the politics of housing, redistributive attitudes, and the interplay of markets and states. I aim to pursue a PhD in Political Science with a focus on comparative politics, political behavior and quantitative methodology.
