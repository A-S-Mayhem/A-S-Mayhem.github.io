I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Rady School of Management, UC San Diego, interested in behavioral and political economics. I'm currently working for Professors [Sally Sadoff](https://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty-research/faculty/sally-sadoff.html) and [Alex Wellsjo](https://www.alexwellsjo.com/) on the design and analysis of experiments.
