Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a first-year Ph.D student of [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu). My principal interests lie in Natural Language Processing, Data Mining and deep learning. 

Before coming OSU, I obtained my B.E. degree from [School of Electronics and Information](http://dianzi.nwpu.edu.cn/en/index.htm) at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/index.htm), supervised by [Prof. Ruonan Zhang](http://dianzi.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1270/5979.htm). I also fortunately worked with [Prof. Xipeng Qiu](http://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/xpqiu/en.html) on NLP at Fudan University and [Prof. Zuqing Zhu](http://www.zuqingzhu.info) on Cloud Computing at University of Science and Technology of China.

For more details, please refer to my latest [*resume*](http://xinjin96.github.io/files/CV_XinJin.pdf) (01/2019) or my [*LinkedIn*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xin-jin-889226174/) profile.
