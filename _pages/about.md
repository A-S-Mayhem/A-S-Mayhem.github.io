I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, [Villanova University]([https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html])), PA, USA. I am the menber of the Dr. Xiongâ€™s Research Group supervised by [Dr. Chenfeng Xiong]([https://www1.villanova.edu/university/engineering/academic-programs/departments/civil-environmental/directory/biodetail.html?mail=chenfeng.xiong@villanova.edu&xsl=bio_long])) and [Dr. Arash Tavakoli]([https://www.arashtavakoli.com/about])), and Dr. C. Nataraj.

I received my M.Eng. degree in traffic and transportation from Lanzhou Jiaotong University in 2023, and received B.Eng. degree in traffic and transportation from Lanzhou Jiaotong University in 2020.

Because of a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning, my current research centers on the area of deep learning, automated driving, and transportation big data. I have participated in Coursera's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?) and [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) courses since Aug.2021 and obtained the Online course certificate. Meanwhile, I learned about lane detection and studied the application of self pre-training with masked sequential autoencoders, submitted a paper with this research(August.2022). I participated in [HUAWEI 2022 Global AI Challenge](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/activity/starAI2022/algo/) to study intelligent quality detection of lane rendering data with further understanding of anomaly detection.
