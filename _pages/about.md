I am a PhD student in Natural Language Pocessing at the NLP lab of Bar Ilan University, supervised by Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty.
Previously I did a research internship at Google, obtained an MSc from the University of Edinburgh and a BA from the University of Zurich.

My research focuses on *discourse* phenomena and *pragmatics*. Often I use QA representations to capture propositions and once in a while I look at the modality of events.

Besides this I love going to the "cinemath√®que" and on hikes with my friends.
