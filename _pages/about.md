Hi! I am now a final-year Ph.D. student at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/), Beijing, China. My major research interests are Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. Prior to CASIA, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in 2016.  
<br/>


Research Interests
======
My research targets at developing computational methods to analyze and mine socially-generated contents. Currently, I focus on the following areas:
* **Opinion mining and opinionated/argumentative text generation**  
Stance analysis and argument mining, especially in low-resource (cross-domain & weak supervision), multi-task, and multi-modal settings.
* **Rumor verification and fact checking**  
Determine the correctness of social media messages, textual claims and structured triples in knowledge graphs      
<br/>
