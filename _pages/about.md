I am Ethan Landers, a senior at Old Dominion University majoring in computer science. I am also enrolled in Old Dominion University’s computer science-linked master’s program. I will graduate with my bachelor’s degree in the spring of 2024 and my master’s degree in the spring of 2025. I am also an Old Dominion University Perry Honors College member. I have an overall 3.93 GPA and a 3.91 departmental GPA.

## Work Experience
I worked full-time alongside a Ph.D. professor and several graduate assistants at Old Dominion University on disinformation detection and analytics research funded by the National Science Foundation through their **Research Experience for Undergraduates** (REU) program for the summer of 2022.

I participated in Old Dominion University's spring 2023 **Innovate Cyber** experiential learning opportunity, where I utilized design thinking with peers to create and eventually pitch a cyber hygiene prototype regarding integrating cyber hygiene learning into Virginia K-12 computer classes.

I participated in a program through a partnership with Old Dominion University and NASA called **NASA@MyLibrary** from October 2021 to June 2023, where I coordinated with libraries across the United States to create and host STEM educational programs via Zoom for their audiences to meet their individual needs.

## Publications
I was [published](https://reuns2023.hotcrp.com/paper/21?cap=hcav21iDTrHiRUNCxdztUQbDPKtQzA) as coauthor for my REU research findings in a publication titled **MSVEC: A Multidomain Testing Dataset for Scientific Claim
Verification** in the 8th National Workshop for REU Research in Networking and Systems (REUNS 2023).


## Awards
Since my enrollment at Old Dominion University, I have earned three scholarship awards: the **Cranmer-Skinner Honors Scholarship** in 2023, the **Richard T. and Nancy P. Cheng Award in Computer Science** in 2022, and the **Old Dominion University Presidential Scholarship** in 2020.
