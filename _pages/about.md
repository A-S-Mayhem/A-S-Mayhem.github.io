I'm a data scientist interested in causal inference, experiments, hypothesis testing, and the nuances of data about people. I work on the Experimentation and Metrics team at Pinterest.

I received my PhD in Statistics from [UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu) in 2019. I was a Fellow at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](http://bids.berkeley.edu) and my advisor was [Philip Stark](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/). 

My PhD work lies at the intersection of Statistics and Social Good. I've analyzed data to uncover gender bias in teaching evaluations, evaluate the impact of nutritional policies, and uncover anomalous results in U.S. elections.

Outside of statistics, I am passionate about food and fitness.
