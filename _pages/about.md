Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am a PhD Candidate in Experimental Finance at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, expecting to finish my PhD trajectory in August 2024. 

My research evolves around personal finance and psychology, in particular,  __individual risk perception__ and __stock investment behavior__. I am fascinated by the different choices individuals make when it comes to the short versus the long run. Should we spend an upcoming salary bonus for a skiing trip or contribute to a retirement savings account? The answer to such a question relies on many different factors, which I aim to uncover in my research.

My research interests also include asset pricing, human-machine interaction, and meta-science.
