I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Political Science and Law Department of the Universitat de Barcelona. I hold a JIN grant (Proyectos "Retos Investigación", en la modalidad I + D + I para jóvenes investigadoras con Vinculación temporal – 3 years, 140.000€), where I study the dynamics of policy processes from a discursive institutionalist perspective. I use computational linguistics methods in order to trace rhetorical influence of interest group organisations on partisan discourse online (Twitter) and offline (Press releases) in multiple issues in a comparative perspective. 


Research
======
My research covers three main areas: Protest, interest groups and collective action; agenda dynamics and political representation; and methodological innovation. The results have been published in 14 peer-reviewed articles in top journals. My current research focuses on political organisations and policy processes using data from social media and parliamentary records in a comparative perspective. I use computational linguistics, machine learning and network analysis to address core questions on inequalities and influence processes of interest groups and social movement organizations through the study of language in the parliamentary arena and social media platforms.
I have also been PI for a one-year national project studying attitudes towards interest groups (AGAUR 2018) and I have co-led the fieldwork for three European research projects polling political organizations, designing, and implementing laboratory and survey experiments, doing automated text analysis of news articles, and surveying demonstrators. In these projects I was responsible for the production, collection, management and analysis of social media and spatial data. 
My research has been oriented to provide innovative theoretical and empirical analysis on collective action, especially looking into social movements and interest group organizations with a focus on outcomes, actions, and public perceptions towards them. I have combined these with research on representation, focusing on political representatives and the interaction of legislative agendas and social organizations. 
As a post-doctoral fellow at Science Po, I focused on the study of parliamentary behaviour by looking into the linguistic style of MPs in parliamentary interventions as a measure of inequalities in substantive representation. 
My independent research program is inspired by both my graduate and postdoctoral studies and will investigate topics at the interface of policy and representation studies with a focus on inequalities and a comparative approach between actors, institutions and arenas. I am currently expanding my research in Europe to the Latin America context, focusing on policy dynamics, elite behaviour and political organisations.
A major aspect of my program is the emphasis on linguistic methods to access public discourse in political text as a starting point to study policy dynamics and representation inequalities. 

Teaching
======
I have experience in teaching political behaviour with an emphasis on collective action, political attitudes, and public opinion; political sociology, concentrating mostly on organizations in politics; public policy with a focus on agenda dynamics; research methods, and applied statistics at the introductory and intermediate level on multiple subfields. 
I also teach computational methods for text and network analyses techniques as well as R language courses. I regularly teach short seminars on applied data science for multiple universities and research centres in social sciences, data journalism, entrepreneurship, or social activism. 
I am an accredited assistant professor (AQU Lector 2018) and (ANECA Contratado doctor 2021). 
I have authored two textbooks on applied statistical research (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya). I have directed more than ten master's theses and three of them have received merit awards as the best in their class. I have mentored eight research assistants who have performed excellently and have been motivated to continue with academic research or have continued their learning path on applied methods. I have also served on three PhD committees, reviewed for seventeen international academic journals and I currently co-supervise a PhD thesis and serve as project evaluator for the Research Agency of the Ministry of Science and Innovation. I am a member of the Quality of Democracy research group, and of academic networks such as Comparative Interest Group Survey, Text Mining of Political and Legal Texts (COMPTEXT) and ECPR Standing Group on Political Methodology.
