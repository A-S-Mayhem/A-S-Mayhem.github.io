# about me



###   Career & hobbies, life story, sources of happiness or worry, and anything else about myself. 

I was born in Shihua, a small town in central China. I spend 18 years in this small town, that's all of my childhood. Then, I went to Guangzhou and spend 3 years in that charming city to pursue my bachelor's degree as a first-generation college student(As a first-generation college student in my family and I know it's hard to get good education resources to learn more efficiently. For instance, it took me about 6 years to learn to how spell 26 English letters when I was in primary school. )  in my family. In my senior year, I moved to Beijing to start my career path as a software engineer intern. Since this, I make the decision that software engineering is my job for my life and I'm proud of this job.

I have never got a friendship or Intimate relationship for more than 2 years. So I always looking forward to interesting people.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies(parasite) and tv series(friends), hanging out with my friend, and meeting more funny people! I enjoy reading books(the economic of common goods) and listening to podcasts about science, and economics(for example, some papers that research the relationship between education and income), etc... I enjoy discussing controversial topics, for example, does traditional Chinese medicine work?  `int* p` or `int *p` which syntax is more intuitive in C++?

### Ideas & values, what I believe (politically, socially, economically), including opinions I have that most people don't agree with me on.

I always feel excited when realized some principles work in my past life, which led to the connection of some dots in my life. For instance, I still remember, I read an article about a team-building event. a bunch of employees play some intellectual games, one person did the best job than anyone else in the game. The key can do such a good job is that it had done lots of training in an efficient or scientific way.  At the end of the article, it summarizes a conclusion which is matched the principle I always believed in.

I believed that everyone shares the same intelligence when it was born. we can do anything successfully with long-time scientific training. 

I am an agnostic(I was an atheist) and believe in science.  I am also interested in the origin of Catholicism. 

I never doubt myself and regret the decision I had ever made. 

I believe that democracy and despotism are tradeoffs and I prefer democracy. 

I'm also a half anarchism.

> free feel to let me know if you have the same value as me or not, I also encourage you to share your value with me.

I wish this world would be full of pace & love and be efficient.
