Introduction
I'm Zhiqiang Wei who is working at China Mobile (Suzhou) Software Technology Co.,Ltd now. As a researcher, I focus on machine learning-based network protocol fuzzing test techniques. Currently, I have proposed a novel GAN-based
fuzzing architecture which aims at detecting vulnerabilities in Message Queuing Telemetry Transport(MQTT) protocol. I also investigate how to apply machine learning methods for message queues traffic detection in cloud systems. Before joining Chine Mobile, I worked as a software engineer in Microsoft(Suzhou) for 
three years.
