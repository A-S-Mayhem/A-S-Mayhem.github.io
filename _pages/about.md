I am a PhD candidate in the department of Computer Science at University of California, Davis, working with Professor [Hao-Chuan Wang](http://www.haochuanwang.info/). My broad research interests are Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Data Science, with a focus on collaboration and social interaction, including peer production, peer support, collaborative consumption, online informal learning, and social computing. 


I hold a B.S. in Statistics from Hunan University (2016) and an M.S. in Statistics from University of California, Davis (2018).
