I'm a Ph.D. student studying artificial intelligence/machine learning under Prof. [Maciej Mazurowski](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowski/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) in the [Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.duke.edu/). My research is in deep learning for medical image analysis, in topics such as anomaly detection and zero-shot learning, self-supervised learning and domain adaptation. 

I have also worked in AI robustness and interpretability as a research intern in the Math, Stats, and Data Science Group at the [Pacific Northwest National Lab](https://www.pnnl.gov/).

See my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=a9rXidMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for a full list of my publications. My CV and coursework can be found [here](https://nickk124.github.io/cv/).

I graduated from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) in 2020 with degrees in Astrophysics and Mathematics, where my research with [Prof. Daniel Reichart](https://www.danreichart.com/) focused on the development of statistical techniques for astronomical data applications.

Teaching is also important to me, and I have been an educator in machine learning, physics, math and astronomy [in the academic setting](https://nickk124.github.io/teaching/) and [beyond](https://nickk124.github.io/outreach/). I have also worked on many [side projects](https://nickk124.github.io/projects/) that have captured my interest. 

In my free time I play the guitar and french horn, practice jiu-jitsu and yoga, cook, and read.
