Hello! I am a 3rd year PhD candidate at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. I work with [Prof. Erin Kara](https://space.mit.edu/people/kara-erin/) on nuclear transients like Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and changing-look AGN. These events allow us to study extreme accretion phenomena, like the formation of accretion disks, relativistic jets, and the X-ray corona, and learn about supermassive black holes that are usually dormant and hard to study! I'm an observer at heart and work with a variety of X-ray observatories to study the evolution of these objects during their outbursts, including [NICER](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/index.html), [XMM-Newton](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/home), [NuSTAR](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nustar/index.html), and [Swift](https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Currently, I'm excited about what we can learn my looking at broad-band multi-wavelength data of these fascinating systems and am working on both optical and infrared follow-up of these transients. In addition to nuclear transients, I also have broad interests in high-energy astrophysics and have also worked on high resolution X-ray spectroscopy of nearby AGN and the evolution of AGN feedback in high-redshift galaxy clusters.
