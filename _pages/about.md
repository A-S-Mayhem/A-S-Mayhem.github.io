I am a PhD Candidate at Institute of AI in Management, LMU Munich School of Management, doing applied Causal Machine Learning research under supervision of [prof. Stefan Feuerriegel](https://www.ai.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/team/head_of_institute/stefan_feuerriegel/index.html).

I believe in the data-driven automation and human-computer cooperation â€“ they should become the main booster of sustainable development and inclusive society.

My research interests include 
- Causal Inference 
- Causal Machine Learning 
- Probabilistic Modelling
