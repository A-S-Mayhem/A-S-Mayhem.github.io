My name is Z. Sun, a 4th year PhD candidate at UCL. I am lucky to be supervised by Prof. [F-X Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io) and Prof. [J-H Xue](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakjxu/). My research is mainly funded by EPSRC and UCL jointly; and partially by The Alan Turing Institute. 





## Research Interest
In general, I am very interested in __computational statistics__ and __machine learning__. I am also very interested in applications of statistics and machine learning.


## Academic Activities
   * PhD researcher at The Alan Turing Institute 2021-2022.
   *  Organiser of 2022 [Statistics in Data-Centric Engineering (S-DCE)]() Seminars at The Alan Turing Institute.
