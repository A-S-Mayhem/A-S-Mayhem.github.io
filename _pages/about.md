I am Ethan Landers, a computer science undergraduate senior studying with Old Dominion University's ODUGlobal.  I am enrolled in the ODU Computer Science Linked Program, where I can take four master's courses in my senior year of undergraduate studies.  I am also a part of the ODU Perry Honors College.

## Projects
**Disinformation Detection and Analytics REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) Program**
For the summer of 2022, I worked full-time alongside a Ph.D. professor and several graduate assistants at Old Dominion University on disinformation detection and analytics research funded by the National Science Foundation.  For the project, I developed a data set to test COVID-19 scientific claim verification models' accuracy in detecting disinformation.

## Awards
Since my enrollment at Old Dominion University, I have earned three scholarship awards: the **Cranmer-Skinner Honors Scholarship** in 2023, the **Richard T. and Nancy P. Cheng Award in Computer Science** in 2022, and the **Old Dominion University Presidential Scholarship** in 2020.
