I am a Professor at the Department of Communication, Michigan State University (MSU).

My current research interest includes computational social science, health communication, mobile analytics, and political communication. I am particularly interested in unraveling the structure & dynamics of human communication phenomena with various computational methods (e.g., network and spatial modeling, text mining, temporal and sequential modeling).

I am now serving as the Associate Editor of the Journal of Communication (2022-). Meanwhile, I serve on the editorial board of several peer-reviewed journals in communication research, including: 
* Computational Communication Research
* Communication Methods and Measures
* Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media
* Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication
