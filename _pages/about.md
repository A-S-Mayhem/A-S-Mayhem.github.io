I am a rising junior computer science undergraduate student at Old Dominion University.  I have been apart of a project called NASA@MyLibrary where I educate library audiences about STEM.  For the summer of 2022, I was accepted into a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program at ODU where I research disinformation detection and analytics full time.

For this program, I work alongside a PhD professor and graduate assistants on a research project.  The task for this project is to replicate COVID-19 scientific claim verification model results; then, I will create a generalized dataset for these models to see how effective they are at detecting disinformation when some news articles may not be related to COVID-19.
