I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Yale University. I specialize in comparative and international politics and the political economy of development, with a particular focus on foreign aid.  I also work on the politics of science and technology. 

Prior to starting the PhD, I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Kosovo. I have a Master's in English literature and a very cute cat named Tara. 

I co-founded the <a href = "https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/" >Graduate Student International Political Economy (GSIPE) workshop</a>. Check out my <a href = "https://cobrienudry.github.io/webscrape/" >github</a> page for videos and sample code for getting started with basic webscraping.
