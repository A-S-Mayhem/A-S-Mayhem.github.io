Hi, I'm Paschal *(pas-kal)*.  
I'm a PhD student at Purdue University's Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, currently advised by [Prof Jamie Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/) and [Prof Aravind Machiry](https://machiry.github.io/).

## Research Interests
My research sits at the intersection of software engineering, security, and embedded systems. I use various static and dynamic analysis techniques to design novel vulnerability detection and software defense systems. My research has been published at [ASE 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10298483), [DSN 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10206998), [Arxiv 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14117) and [ESEC/FSE 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3540250.3560879).

## Personal
Fun facts about me
- I love discussing politics, startups, and strategies. 
- I can hardly resist an invitation to join a road trip or visit a new city.
- If I'm not working or reading, I am probably watching a movie.
- I am scared of heights ðŸ˜©.
- I am passionate about Nigeria, and Africa.
