I am an incoming economics PhD student at the University of Wisconsin- Madison interested in family and labor economics. Before graduate school, I worked as a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. During my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, where I majored in Economics and English, I interned at an education policy non-profit and studied the effects of police officers in schools on students' perceptions of safety.
