I am a second year PhD student in the field of Artificial Intelligence at Imperial College London under the supervision of [Prof. Bj√∂rn Shuller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TxKNCSoAAAAJ&hl=en). My current work focuses on Self-supervised learning for auditory inference and Quantised Representation Learning. I am a Teaching Scholar in the Department of Computing currently studying part time for a PGCert in Higher Education and represent the Department of Computing PhD students on the Equality Diversity and Culture Commity ([EDCC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/about/equality-and-diversity/edcc/)). Currently I am seconded to [The Alan Turing Institue](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and the [UK Government's Health Security Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency) working on combatting the COVID-19 pandemic.
