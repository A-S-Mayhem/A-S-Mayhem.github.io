I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Centre for Biomedical and Healthcare Engineering](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/research/5-research-academic-centers/center-biomedical-healthcare-engineering/), [École des Mines de Saint-Étienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/), under the supervision of Assistant Professor [Benjamin DALMAS](http://www.bendalmas.com/) and Professor [Xiaolan XIE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088069933). <br>
After graduating from [XIDIAN University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xidian_University) (Xi'an, China) in 2016, I received two years of basic training in Computer Science at a French Grande École in engineering: [Télécom Saint-Etienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9l%C3%A9com_Saint-%C3%89tienne) (Saint-Etienne, France). In 2018, I started to specialize in the Data Science domain and enrolled in a double master's program in Data Science from [University of Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lyon) (Saint-Etienne, France). In Sept 2019, I received a master's degree in Computer Science and a double master's degree in Data Science.

Research
======
My research interests mainly lie in **Explainable AI applied in healthcare**, but also include data mining, operation research and optimization algorithms. <br>
Indeed, my works focus on **interpretable** analysis of those areas and building scalable and effective **optimization** models for them, from theoretical algorithms to practical applications.

Publications
======
1. **Chen HE**, Benjamin DALMAS, Xiaolan XIE, "ACBI: An Alternating Clustering and Bayesian Inference Approach for Optimizing Medical Intervention Budget under Chance Constraints", in the Proceedings of the IEEE 16th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering, [IEEE CASE 2020](https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE48305.2020.9216791).
