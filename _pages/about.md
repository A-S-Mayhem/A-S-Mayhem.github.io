Iâ€™m Jaspor, a master student in medical robotics. Since April 2022, I studied as a master of science at Laboratory for Computational Science and Robotics in Johns Hopkins University.

I completed my Bachelor at University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, where I worked as a Research Assistant from 2019 to 2022. 

I care about promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science. In my free time, you will find me travelling around the world, discovering the beauty of nature.
