Sarah P. Flanagan has just begun her appointment as a Lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The lab is focused on understanding the evolution of complex, multivariate traits (such as mating display traits), primarily relying on population and quantitative genetics, genomic datasets, simulation modeling. Our empirical work has mostly focused on pipefish and seahorses.
