🏫 I am a first-year PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne, in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Systems.

🔬 Currently investigating automatic venues of frame detection in news coverage of contemporary polarizing issues,
supervised by [Prof. Dr. Lea Frermann](https://www.frermann.de/) and [Prof. Dr. Ed Hovy](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/887453-eduard-hovy)

👨‍💻 Previously, I have completed a Masters in Speech and Language Processing at the University of Konstanz.

📚 My research interests evolve around Natural Language Processing, with a focus on ethical and interpretable approaches.
