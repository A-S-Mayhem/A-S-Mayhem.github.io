I am a Ph.D candidate in Economics at Claremont Graduate University (CGU) and a member of the [Computational Justice Lab](https://www.http://computationaljusticelab.org/). My primary research interest is applied microeconomics; however, my other interests include causal inference and applications of machine learning methods for causal inference.
