I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Milan, working on the project *VIPoP — The Visual Politics of Populism* (PRIN 2023–2025). My research focuses on how parties and leaders strategically use different modes of political communication—both visual and textual—in response to varying incentives. 

I also apply computational tools to legislative politics in the European Union, developing scalable methods to measure how laws structure executive discretion through delegating and constraining provisions. 

Beyond these core areas, I have broader interests in using computational text analysis to explore media narratives, democratic rhetoric, and gender dynamics in political speech.

Before my current position, I was a postdoc in the DAPs&CO program—an initiative for research and undergraduate teaching on computational methods for political science, funded under Italy’s Departments of Excellence scheme. I completed my PhD in Political Science atmy PhD in Political Science at [NASP](https://www.nasp.eu/training/phd-programmes/pols.html), a joint programme of the Department of Social and Political Sciences of the University of Milan, where I studied online campaigning and affective polarization during the 2019 European Parliament elections.
