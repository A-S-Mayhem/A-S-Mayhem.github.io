I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University's Engineering Science (ENSC) department, deeply passionate about research in deep learning and computer vision. Currently, I am dedicated to exploring the intersections of Information Theory and Deep Learning, with a specific focus on developing learned image codecs for machines. I am experienced in Python programming, both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks, and have been actively engaged with neural networks since 2016.

My research interests include:

* Object Detection and Segmentation
* Learned Image and Video Compression
* Scalable Image Codecs for Humans and Machines
