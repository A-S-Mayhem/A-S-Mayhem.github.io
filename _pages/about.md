I am a lifelong learner who enjoys what I do. I was born in a remote village in Telangana, India's beautiful state known as "South of North and North of South." I earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the <a href="https://vce.ac.in" target="_blank">Vasavi College of Engineering(VCE)</a>, Hyderabad. My masters from <a href="https://jntuh.ac.in" target="_blank">Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University</a>, Hyderabad.

Having 10+ years of an education domain experience in software development using Microsoft .Net and ML/DL technologies with good exposure to the full software development.

Currently I am Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science & Engineering, <a href="http://www.uceou.edu" target="_blank">University College of Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.osmania.ac.in" target="_blank">Osmania University</a>, Hyderabad working under supervision of <a href="https://vce.ac.in/Faculty_Details.cshtml?id=1280" target="_blank">Prof. Ram Mohan Rao</a>. During my doctoral studies, I investigated the field of Anomaly Intrusion detection in Network based using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques.

I am broadly interested in system security and network security where I work on building secure systems, developing practical detection systems for democratizing and accelerating smooth transactions. 

My research is generously supported by the <a href="https://vce.ac.in" target="_blank">Vasavi College of Engineering(VCE)</a>, Hyderabad. Thank you!
