I am a PhD candidate in School of Sociology at University of Arizona, mainly researching social movements, organizational behavior, and policy change. In my dissertation, I use statistical, network, and computational methods to study how social movements shape corporate activity, labor market outcome and related legislative policymaking. I am also interested in family research and demography. My work appears (will appear) in [Journal of Marriage and Family](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12419/full), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9) and Poetics.
