I am a PhD candidate in School of Sociology at University of Arizona, mainly researching social movements, organizational behavior, and policy change. My dissertation uses statistical, network, and computational methods to study the antecedents and consequences of shareholder and stakeholder activism against U.S. corporate political spending practices and policies. I am also interested in family, demography, and terrorism research. My work appears in [Journal of Marriage and Family](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12419/full), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9) and [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001).
