About
======
I am a quantitative social scientist interested in examining how socio-economic inequality shapes the lives of individuals.

Currently, I mainly study wealth inequality with a focus on the family, gender, and the superrich.

For my research I use various methods and data (survey data, experimental data, tax data, and web scraped data).


I work in the [Research Group on Wealth and Social Inequality](https://www.mpifg.de/research/wealth-and-social-inequality) at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne, Germany](https://mpifg.de).
