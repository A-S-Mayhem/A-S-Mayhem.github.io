I am currently working as a research assistant and pursuing my Ph.D. in Economics at the [Chair of Economic Policy and Economic Research](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/wirtschaft/vwl/wuw) at Dresden University of Technology. As an applied microeconomist, my focus lies within the area of political economy and social choice. In my research, I delve into the relationship between policy and voting behavior.
Specifically, I explore various aspects, including the influence of information on voting modes and turnout, the repercussions of relocating polling stations on voter participation, and the impact of natural reserves on party outcomes. My work aims to contribute valuable insights to the intersection of economics, politics, and social decision-making.
