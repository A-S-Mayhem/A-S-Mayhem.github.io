Hello, I am a post-doctoral researcher at RMIT University's [Intelligent Automation Research Group](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/engineering/research/research-groups/intelligent-automation-research-group) in Australia. I obtained my Ph.D. from the same institution in 2022, under the supervision of [Prof. Alireza Bab-Hadiashar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-bab-hadiashar-0a881a31/), [Prof. Reza Hoseinnezhad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rezahn/) and [Dr Ruwan Tennakoon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruwan-tennakoon-923a3437/). My research primarily focuses on machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) topics such as representation learning, domain adaptation and generalization, Bayesian deep learning, information theory, geometric vision (3D reconstruction, stereo matching, optical flow), semantic/panoptic segmentation, image classification, and object detection.

In addition to my research, I have experience working as a tutor and lab demonstrator for the Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses at RMIT University in 2021 and 2022. Prior to that, I was also a lab demonstrator and teaching assistant for courses like Digital Fundamental and Introduction to Mechatronics. I am an active reviewer for top-tier CV conferences such as ICCV and CVPR.

I activately serve as reviewer for top tier CV conferences such as ICCV and CVPR. I am passionate about acquiring new knowledge and delivering novel solutions developed from theoretical research to solve practical industrial problems. I also very much enjoy teaching&#128214;, doing research&#128187;, and drinking coffee&#9749;.

I am passionate about using theoretical research to develop novel solutions for practical industrial problems. As a lifelong learner, I am always seeking new knowledge to improve my understanding of ML and CV. When I am not working, I enjoy reading&#128214;, fishing:fishing_pole_and_fish:, and savoring a good cup of coffee&#9749;. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me.
