Hi, I am a first year PhD student at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata advised by [Prof. Mandar Mitra](https://www.isical.ac.in/~mandar/) and [Dr. Debapriyo Majumdar](https://www.isical.ac.in/~debapriyo/). I have been reading some recent papers on Explainability and Interpretability, Neural IR to find a suitable research problem for my doctoral research.
