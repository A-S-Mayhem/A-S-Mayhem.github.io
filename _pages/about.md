I am a Research Associate in the ECE Department at the University of Waterloo. We seek to combine the high-performance merits of data-driven approaches with the theoretical guarantees of stability and safety benefits of classical model-based control methods. Prior to joining the University of Waterloo, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the ECE Department at Queenâ€™s University. I proposed a high-performance path following algorithm that combines Gaussian Processes (GP) and Feedback Linearization (FBL) with Model Predictive Control (FBLMPC) for ground mobile robots operating in off-road terrains, referred to as [GP-FBLMPC](http://jiewang.name/publications/GP-FBLMPC2021/). 

I received my PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in robotics control, from the University of Calgary, Canada. The research focused on locomotion mode selection and motion planning of a leg-tracked [quadrupedal robot](http://jiewang.name/publications/arXiv2019/). After that, I worked as a Postdoc Fellow at the University of Calgary. I developed and implemented perception solutions for micro aerial vehicles including [visual SLAM](http://jiewang.name/publications/slam2019) and CNN-based multi-object detection and [tracking](http://jiewang.name/publications/rsmdpi2019).
