This is Wei Cheng (Michael)'s page on the web.

I am currently a research assistant in Academia Sinica working on the architecture for the next generation memory. My research interests includes: Computer Architecture, Non‐Volatile Memory, Graph Analytics Accelerators.

I have been interested in the hardware/software co-design of computing systems since my undergraduate study. I was first fascinated by the power of parallel computing (especially GPUs) and software-level optimizations; however, I then noticed that it is necessary to understand the hardware system to come up with a thorough solution. Therefore, I have been polishing my hardware design skills and designing my own chips (FPGAs and ASICs) since my master's study. Moreover, I set foot in the field of emerging memory and found that it is a promising candidate in the post-Moore’s law era, so my master's thesis is about the performance modeling of a graph analytics accelerator based on non-volatile memory systems. Aside from these research topics, I have experience in some open-source RISC-V emulators and RV-based CNN accelerators.
