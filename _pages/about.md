I was born in Zaragoza (Spain), where I also obtained my Computer Science Engineering degree. Now I am living in Madrid, where I work as a research engineer Desilico Labs S.L. while I am finishing the final project for my Master's degree in Computer Graphics, Videogames and Virtual Reality.

I really enjoy playing videogames, reading books and watching movies. Also I like to work on projects related to render, offline and real-time, but specially physically based offline render projects.
