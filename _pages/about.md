I'm a junior-year undergraduate student at WPI(Worcester Polytechnic Institute) majoring in Robotic Engineering and Computer Science. Currently, I am doing research supervised by Prof. [Ziming Zhang](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/zzhang15) at [VISLab@WPI](https://zhang-vislab.github.io/), Prof. [Markus Nemitz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/mnemitz) at [RMG](https://wp.wpi.edu/roboticmaterialsgroup/), Prof. [Christopher Julius Nycz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/cjnycz), and Prof. [Gregory S.
