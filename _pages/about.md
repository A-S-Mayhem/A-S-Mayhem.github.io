Welcome to WE lab, where the intricate landscape of human emotions is explored, dissected, and understood. Specifically, we focus on Emotion Representation (formation and representation of emotions) , motion Prediction (the mechanisms that enable us to accurately anticipate and interpret the emotions of those around us) and Emotion Representation and Prediction in Special Conditions (extended research on special conditions and clinical contexts) Our work investigates the concept of emotion on a fundamental level. Using behavioral, EEG, FMRI, Multi-channel Physiological Recorder, alongside the computational Modeling, we strive to advance the field of emotion science. Our work not only sheds light on the fundamental nature of emotions but also has practical implications for improving well-being, mental health interventions, and human-computer interactions. Join us on this journey of discovery as we explore the fascinating realm of emotions, aiming to contribute to the betterment of society through our research endeavors. Welcome to WE Lab, where emotions become the gateway to a deeper comprehension of the human psyche.
