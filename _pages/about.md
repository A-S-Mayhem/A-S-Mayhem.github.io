Welcome! My name is Baileigh Brown and I am a gradute student at Kennesaw State University getting my masters in software engineering. I received my undergraduate degree from Gordon State College in Education. I am a informational technology intern at Mckenney's Inc. in Atlanta, Georgia where I get to explore a plethora of technological concepts and gain a better understanding as I get experience in the field.
