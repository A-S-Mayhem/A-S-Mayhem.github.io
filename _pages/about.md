My name is Kia Rahmani and I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year PhD student of computer science at Purdue University. 
I am a member of the [programming languages group](https://purduepl.github.io/), 
working under the supervison of Professor [Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/).
My main topics of reseach interests include formal methods of modeling, analysis and verification of applications. 
I specifically focuse on automated generation of
verifiably correct and scalable distributed database-backed applications.




## Projects
#### Sound Static Detection of Bugs in Highly Scalable Distributed Applications for Weakly Consistent Databases
#### Enforcement of finde-grained consistency guarantees using effect orchestration
#### Coq Implementation of Quelea
