Jerson is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biostatistics at Brown 
University and works under the supervision of Professor [Roee Gutman](https://roeegutman.wordpress.com/). His 
areas of interest and research include Bayesian data 
analysis, missing data, causal inference and machine learning.

Jerson received a B.S. with Honors in Mathematics from Stony Brook 
University (SBU) in 2015. He went on to receive an M.S. in Statistics from the Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics at SBU
under the supervision of Professor Hongshik Ahn. In addition, Jerson served 
as a [lecturer](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=1879597) in both the Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics and 
the Department of Mathematics from 2015-2016. 

Jerson joined Dr. David Lederer's lab in 2014 at Columbia University Medical 
Center as a trainee in Pulmonary & Intensive Care Translational Outcomes 
Research where he worked on the Lung Allocation Score. Their work re-examined 
factors predisposing patients to respiratory
failure while awaiting lung transplantation in order to readjust the lung 
allocation scoring system.

From 2016-2018, Jerson was a Fellow in the Department of Biostatistics 
at Brown University where he was recognized by the School of Public Health 
with an [Impact Award](https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostats/news/2018/10/congratulations-jerson-cochancela)
for his commitment to equity and inclusion. As a 
Fellow in 2017, Jerson joined the 
[Hassenfeld 
Insititute](https://www.brown.edu/hassenfeld/community-learners/summer-scholars/2017) and was involved with Lifespan researching childhood asthma. 
Using geospatial data specific to Providence, RI, he examined how neighborhood 
risk moderates the association between asthma and asthma
related emergency room visits ultimately informing interventions in high 
risk neighborhoods. In 2018, before beginning his Ph.D. at Brown University, 
Jerson joined the Data Science team at Johnson & Johnson and developed 
anomaly detection software by refactoring Prophet, the Facebook Bayesian 
forecasting package, in order to curb malicious 
purchasing patterns.
