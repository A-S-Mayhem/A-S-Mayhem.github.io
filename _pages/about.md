<h3><i>Using cutting edge microscopy to understand the role of physical forces in cellular behaviour.</i></h3>
<br>
During biology classes in high school most of the students get the chance to see the structure of onion tissue. The way that onion cells are connect to each other might lead to the wrong idea of how tissue are organised. Our body is made of different tissues, with different properties. Different cells form different tissues. However, not only cells are responsible for such differences.
In mammalian tissues the majority of the cells are not directly connect to each other. Like the cement that keeps bricks in a wall, cells use polymers to hold together as a tissue. This mesh of
