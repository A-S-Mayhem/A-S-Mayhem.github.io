## About Me

I am a PhD student working on building photovoltaic applications. Especially, my work focuses on modelling failures as well as quantifying diagnostic methods in order to build a performance garantee on solar installations. My personal belief is that research owes to find solutions to mitigate the human environmental impact.

## Where I come from 

Originally from the mountainy area of Grenoble in France, I have been educated through two MSc in Engineering and Sustainable Energy respectively from CentraleSupelec (France) and DTU (Denmark). 

On my spare time, I love adventuring in the mountains, breathing fresh air and embracing the beauty of nature. My activities include hiking, ski-touring, climbing but also doing judo.

## Five random facts about me

1. In 2016, I left my native land of Grenoble, FRANCE with ambitions to finally come back in 2022... with more convictions.
2. My desire of travelling and hiking led me to feel like an astronaut when climbing the Chachani Summit in Peru, 6000m in 2017.
3. My hatred towards programming turned to love when I got to learn to use it to apply mathematics, build data pipelines and analytically support energy trading at Orsted. 
4. I found myself on top of the podium at the Judo Danish Championship 2019.
5. I cannot stop initiating and following long-term goals.
