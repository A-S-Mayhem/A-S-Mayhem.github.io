I am an **[Old Dominion University](https://odu.edu/) graduate student** pursuing an **M.S. in Computer Science**, where I expect to graduate by Spring 2025.

Technology, understanding different cultures, and continual learning have always been central to my life.  I thrive on the excitement of generating creative and innovative solutions within a collaborative setting while continually learning from others and my own experiences.

In December 2023, I began organizing for two local Southwest Florida Meetup communities, [Python SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/pythonswfl/) and the [Tech Alliance of SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/techallianceswfl/).

I am passionate about technology, communication, travel, concerts, and mastering Spanish :)
