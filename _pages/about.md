I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Georgia State University](https://politicalscience.gsu.edu/) in Atlanta, Georgia. I received my BA and MA from [Political Science and International Relations Department at Bogazici University](https://pols.boun.edu.tr/). My current research agenda focuses on political parties, opposition cooperation and coordination, and authoritarian regimes. 

My research has been published in the *Party Politics*, *Journal of Peace Research*, and *Journal of Civil Society*. My published and working papers can be found on my [publications page](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/publications/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q4RzaGMAAAAJ&hl=en). Access my most current CV [here](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/cv/).

My dissertation research addresses the pre-electoral coalitions formed in electoral autocratic regimes. I adopt a mixed-methodological approach - large-N quantitative analysis, causal case selection, and site-intensive methods - to explore how political parties' organizational structures and ideological and political agenda diversity explain opposition bargaining prior to the elections. My dissertation research has been supported by the [William A. Steiger Fund for Legislative Studies](https://connect.apsanet.org/centennialcenter/2022/09/01/pre-electoral-opposition-coalitions-in-authoritarian-regimes/) of the APSA Centennial Grant, Craigie Fellowship, and GSU's [Library Dissertation Award](https://graduate.gsu.edu/dissertation-library-travel-awards/). See details of my dissertation project [here](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/dissertation/).

I was the Chair of the [Atlanta Symposium on Political Science](https://sites.google.com/view/asops2023/home?authuser=0) (ASOPS). I also served as elected Ph.D. representative of my department's Diversity and Inclusion Committee. In my free time, I volunteer at [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) or I like to hike, cook, read, and play tennis or tabletop games.
