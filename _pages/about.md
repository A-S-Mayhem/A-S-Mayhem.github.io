I am a research assistant and Ph.D. student in Economics at the Chair of Economic Policy and Economic Research at [Dresden University of Technology](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/wirtschaft/vwl/wuw). Specilizing in applied microeconomics, my interests are primarily in the fields of political economy and social choice. My research centers on the examination of policy effects on voting behavior, specifically addressing topics such as the impact of information on voting modes and turnout, the consequences of relocating polling stations on voter turnout, and the effects of natural reserves on party outcomes.
