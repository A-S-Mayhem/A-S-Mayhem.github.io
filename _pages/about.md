I am a researcher in statistics and machine learning in the [MAGNET](https://team.inria.fr/magnet/) team of Inria Lille. I am notably focused on decentralized learning methods, on the different tradeoffs that appear when trustworthy constraints (privacy, robustness, fairness) are imposed, and on provably quantifing the prediction uncertainty of decentralized models.

From June 2023 to July 2024, I was a postdoc in the [ARGO](https://www.di.ens.fr/argo/) team of Inria Paris and [DI ENS](https://www.di.ens.fr/) (computer science department of Ecole Normale Supérieure), working with [Kevin Scaman](https://kscaman.github.io/) on the generalization properties of Federated Learning algorithms. I also worked in close collaboration with [Aurélien Bellet](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/), [Marc Tommasi](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/tommasi/) and [Giovanni Neglia](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/). Before that, I was a postdoc in the [MAGNET](https://team.inria.fr/magnet/) team, working with Marc Tommasi, Aurélien Bellet and [Anne-Marie Kermarrec](https://people.epfl.ch/anne-marie.kermarrec) (EPFL) on decentralized optimization. 

In January 2021, I completed a PhD in applied mathematics at Centre Borelli, ENS Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of Prof. [Nicolas Vayatis](https://nvayatis.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) and [Argyris Kalogeratos](https://kalogeratos.com/psite/). My thesis work focused on statistical learning problems for data observed over graph structures, with applications to anomaly and change-point detection.

Prior to my thesis, I obtained a master in mathematics, computer vision and machine learning (MVA) at ENS Paris-Saclay.
