I am a PhD candidate in Eric Lyonâ€™s lab (http://www.lyonslab.net/) at University of Arizona. My primary research focus is on identification and characterization of long non-coding RNAs while I spend my spare time learning and teaching computational skills to biologists. I am also an active Data Carpentry instructor rooting for open-science.
