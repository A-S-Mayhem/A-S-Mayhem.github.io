I'm a fifth-year PhD candidate in the Swartz Lab in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Brown University. 

Bats, the only mammals capable of powered flight, find themselves in a unique thermal environment. Since they are primarily active at night
their wings are subjected to substantial radiative and conductive heat loss, even in warm ambient conditions. Despite the potential for 
heat loss, bat wing muscles are so poorly insulated as to be clearly visible through the skin. How do bats maintain flight performance 
from a biomechanical and physiological perspective, if their flight muscles are consistently cool?
