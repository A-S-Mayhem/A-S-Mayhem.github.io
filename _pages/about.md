My name is Kia Rahmani and I am a PhD candidate of computer science at Purdue University. 
I am a member of the [programming languages group](https://purpl.cs.purdue.edu/), 
working under the supervision of 
Professor [Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/) 
and 
Professor [Benjamin Delaware](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bendy/)
.
My research interests include formal methods of modeling, analysis and verification of (classical or quantom) computer programs. 
My PhD thesis is focused around compilation, synthesis and testing of modern database-backed programs.


I was previously a research intern at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), working on a new program synthesis technique based on pre-trained language models. My work was supervised by Dr. [Mohammad Raza](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/moraza/) and Dr. [Sumit Gulwani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumitg/).
