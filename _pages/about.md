Hi! 
------

Thanks for stopping by. My name is Siqi and I am a PhD student under the advisement of Professor [Liu Nan](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/directory/detail/liu-nan) at Duke-NUS Medical School.

I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in both Statistics and Mathematics from the University of Michigan in April, 2021. 
Prior to my experience at UM, I've spent two years at Huazhong University of Science & Technology studying Biosciences.
