Hi there! I'm Jia Yi, a rising senior in [School of Mathematical Science](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), specializing in Statistics and concurrently pursuing a double major in Economics.

I have a very broad interest in Statistics, Machine Learning and Quantitative Finance. Currently I'm doing research about mutual fund market efficiency in China by Machine Learning methods, advised by Prof. [Ruixun Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/ZhangRuixun%20/index.html). I have previously interned at Citadel Securities as a Quant Researcher. I have also studied at Harvard college as a visiting undergraduate student in 2023 Spring. Check out my [CV](https://pkuyijia.github.io/files/CV_Jia.pdf) for more information!

Feel free to reach out if you have anything to chat!
