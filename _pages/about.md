I am an epidemiologist, modeler, and multidisciplinary data scientist with
experience in infectious disease, microbiome science, microbiology, antibiotic
resistance, statistics, computing, and mathematical modeling. I have developed
skill sets in facilitation, technical communication, and project management.

## Work history

I work at [Biobot Analytics](https://www.biobot.io), where I lead the Epidemiology
group in the Data Science Team. Our goal is to
connect wastewater-based data streams with public health
actions. Biobot performs Covid-19 monitoring for places
like [Boston, MA](https://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm).

During 2020--2021, I was a part-time Research Analyst in the [Center for Public Health
Preparedness and Resilience](https://www.cna.org/centers/ipr/phpr/) in the
[Institute for Public Research](https://www.cna.org/centers/ipr/) at
[CNA](https://www.cna.org/). CNA is a nonprofit research institute that
provides objective analysis to Federal, state, and local government. At CNA,
I helped advise the US Navy, Federal agencies, and state and city
officials, especially on their Covid-19 responses.

As an independent epidemiological consultant with Dr. [Yonatan
Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/), I co-designed a model used
to inform the design of the National Basketball Association's "bubble"
for the 2020 play-offs.

Before COVID-19, I was Scientific Director at
[OpenBiome](http://www.openbiome.org), a non-profit stool bank based in
Boston. OpenBiome provides material for fecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) for use in treating *C. difficile* infection and for research.

## Educational background

I did my postdoctoral training with [Yonatan
Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/) at the Harvard Chan School
of Public Health, where I focused on antimicrobial resistance, and my PhD
with [Eric Alm](http://almlab.mit.edu/) at MIT, where I worked in
environmental microbiology, human microbiome science, and clinical trial
design.

At MIT, I was a founding member of MIT's [Biological Engineering
Communciation Lab](http://bewritinglab.mit.edu/), where I co-led the
development of the first [CommKit](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/), a guide to
communication tasks designed by scientists for scientists. I was also a
founding member of the MIT [Biological Engineering REFS](http://berefs.com/),
a peer-to-peer conflict management and mentoring program, and a Diversity
Chair on the department's graduate student board. During my postdoc I served
as the President of the [Harvard Chan Postdoc
Association](http://hsph.me/pda) and served on the School's Committee for
Diversity and Inclusion.
