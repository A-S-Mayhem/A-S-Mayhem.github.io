Hi there! Excited to meet you! <br />
I'm Dipendra Yadav and I'm living my dream as a Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute of Data Science](https://datascience.uni-greifswald.de/) of the [University of Greifswald](https://www.uni-greifswald.de/en/). I'm lucky to have [Professor Kristina Yordanova](http://stenialo.org/about-me/) as my supervisor and together, we're exploring uncharted territory in the fields of Data Science and Natural Language Processing. With my background in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, and a major in NLP, I bring a unique perspective to the table. <br />
Before diving into the depths of research in NLP, I was a Research Assistant at the chair of [Mobile Multimedia Information Systems](https://www.mmis.informatik.uni-rostock.de/) of the [University of Rostock](https://www.uni-rostock.de/en/) where I delved into Neural Density Estimation. And at [PLANET AI](https://planet-ai.de/), I sharpened my skills as a Software Engineer and got to work on developing and testing cutting-edge [Intelligent Document Analysis](https://planet-ai.de/products/ida/) software. <br />
This website is a glimpse into my world of research, education, and work experience. I hope you'll enjoy learning more about me and my journey!
