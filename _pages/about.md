I am fascinated by geoscience and interested in the interctions between climate and tectonic processes that impacts all facets of life, hibitability and sustainability. My research focuses on quantifying climate-tectonic interplay in shaping earth's surface and paleoenvironment using (1) dating techniques, such as thermochronology, optically stimulated luminescence; (2) remote sensing data; (3) multidisiplinary sedimentology, tectonics, and geomorphology approach; and (4) statistical and numerical modeling. I have worked on Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya (specifically in the Siang, Dibang and Lohit river valley), Shillong plateau, and Belt of Schuppen (specially in the southeastern boundary of Assam valley and western part of Nagaland).
