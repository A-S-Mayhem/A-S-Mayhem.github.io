## About Me

Hi! My name is Zirui. I am interested in theoretical and computational astrophysics. 

I earned my undergraduate degrees in Physics and Astronomy at Columbia University, where I was a John Jay Scholar, a Junior Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated with departmental honors. During my undergrad, I had the pleasure to work with Greg Bryan and Drummond Fielding on developing analytic models for turbulent radiative mixing layers in galaxies, and with David Kipping on transit patterns of circumbinary planets. 

In Fall 2022, I am going to start pursuing my (Astro)physics PhD at UC Santa Barbara, where I will be working with [Siang Peng Oh](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~peng/), supported by the [James and Mary Jo Hartle Graduate Fellowship](https://giving.ucsb.edu/Funds/Give?id=348).
