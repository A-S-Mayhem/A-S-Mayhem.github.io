I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/). I am co-advised by Professor [Bistra Dilkina](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Dilkina/Bistra) and Professor [Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/index.html).

In 2019, I received my B.E. in computer science from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University.

In Spring 2018, I was a research intern at Carneige Mellon University advised by Professor [Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/).   
In Summer 2018, I was a research intern at The University of Hong Kong advised by Professor [Zhiyi Huang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/).

My research interests lie in artificial intelligence, with a focus on multi-agent systems, combinatorial optimization, machine learning, computational game theory and computational sustainability.
