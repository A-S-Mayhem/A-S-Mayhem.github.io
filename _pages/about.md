I'm a philosopher and cognitive scientist engaged in both theoretical and experimental research in embodied cognitive science and ecological psychology.  My research focuses on the implications of embodiment for how we make sense of "higher cognition" and technologically-supported problem solving. 

Since May 2020 I've been a postdoctoral researcher at Technische Universität Berlin, where I founded the [EMBODY Research Group](https://embody-rg.github.io/). My postdoc mentors are Miriam Kyselo (Philosophy @ NTNU) and Klaus Gramann (Biological Psychology and Neuroergonomics @ TU Berlin).

Previously, in 2019 I received my PhD in philosophy at the University of Cincinnati (working with Angela Potochnik). There I also received graduate training in experimental psychology at the Center for Cognition, Action, & Perception (working with Paula Silva and Tony Chemero). Before Cincinnati I was a visiting student for two semesters at the Georgia Institute of Technology (working with Nancy Nersessian) and for one semester at Georgia State University. Before that I earned a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in philosophy from the University of São Paulo (Brazil), where I'm from.  

About 
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
