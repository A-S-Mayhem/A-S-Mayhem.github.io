About Me
======
I am a robotics engineer with 5 years of experience utilising machine learning and optimisation techniques in a unique combination of applications for the design, development, and data analysis of soft sensors, and controllers for soft tensegrity robots, which has culminated in the successful development of multiple novel sensors and data-driven solutions, both in research and industry.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working under the supervision of Professor Dario Floreano in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. I am a contributor to the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (MERGING) where I applied data-driven methods to help bring robots into assembly lines for manufacturing deformable objects. I was previously a PhD candidate in the Soft Robotics Group at the University of Bristol, supervised were Professor Helmut Hauser and Professor Jonathan Rossiter. During my PhD, I developed optimisation and machine learning algorithms to automate the design of soft sensors.
