I am a PhD student at CREST, under the supervision of Vianney Perchet, since September 2020. My PhD title is "Online Matching in Random Graphs". I am interested in statistics and learning theory, and more specifically in online learning and algorithms. My current topics of research are Online Matching and Multi-Armed bandits.

Before that I got an engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique and graduated the master MVA (Machine Learning and Computer Vision) from ENS Paris-Saclay.
