I am a first year PhD student at [CDT in NLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/), [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) advised by [Dr. Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/) and [Prof. Mark Steedman](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/). My research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing. I am associated with the [STATMT](http://www.statmt.org/ued/) group. I will be exploring the area of multilingual dialogue systems.

Previously, I completed MS (by Research) from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) 
where I was jointly advised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/). My thesis involved incorporating information from unstructured data to improve dialogue systems. I was also associated with [RBC-DSAI](https://rbc-dsai.iitm.ac.in/).
