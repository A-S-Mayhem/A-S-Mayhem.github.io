An economist using programming skills to get original data.

I am part of Research of research group in the [think-tank IDEA](https://idea.cerge-ei.cz/) at [CERGE-EI](https://cerge-ei.cz/). I am also a Ph.D student on [Institute of Economic Studies](http://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/) on Faculty of Social Sciences of Charles University. My dissertation focuses on academic misconduct and globalization in science. My supervisor and close co-author is Martin Srholec. 

Research
======
The starting point of our research is the research environment in the Czech Republic. We aim to identify problems, find the data accurately describing it and analyze it.

My largest contribution in the process is the passion about data processing. I do everything from scraping the data from the internet to interactive visualizations in Javascript and [D3](https://d3js.org/).
