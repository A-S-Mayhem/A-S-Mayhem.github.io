  <img class="img-responsive" style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/images/profile.jpg" width="320"> I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Economics Department at UC Berkeley. Before my doctoral studies, I received my MSc degree in Economics at University College London and B.A. at Universidad del Pacífico in Peru. I have worked as a research associate at Universidad del Pacífico and as an evaluation specialist in Peru's Ministry of Economics and Finance. In addition, I have been awarded a Chevening Fellowship Award from the Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO) in the United Kingdom.
I work on topics in labor, discrimination, education economics, and applied econometrics. For more information, please see my CV.
