Hi, all! I am a senior student in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department at Bilkent University. I am also a Machine Learning Researcher in Prof.Dr.Suleyman Serdar Kozat's research group.

My research interests are Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Signal Processing. The research I conducted with Prof.Dr.Suleyman Serdar Kozat focuses on statistical learning, data analysis, the design of state-of-the-art algorithms for time series and spatio-temporal prediction, and feature selection in high-dimensional spaces.
