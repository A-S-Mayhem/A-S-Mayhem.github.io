I'm a scientist interested in the fields of neuroscience and mathematical modeling of the brain. With a background in both mathematical engineering and computational biology, I have been always  fascinated by the intricacies of the human brain and how it gives rise to our consciousness, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

I've worked on numerous research projects focused on developing mathematical models that can help explain the complex interactions between brain cells and networks,  and understanding the neural and computational basis of consciousness. In addition to my research, I'm also an avid educator, regularly giving lectures and teaching courses on the brain and consciousness to both undergraduate and graduate students.
