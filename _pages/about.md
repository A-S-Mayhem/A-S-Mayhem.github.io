I an economics PhD student at Northwestern University with research interests in health and macro-labor. Prior to Northwestern, I studied (and [ran!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eidacczk0gg)) for the University of Chicago, served as an AmeriCorps VISTA at the [IndyEast Promise Zone](https://indyeast.org), and worked as pre-doc (more on that here). I often use this site as a sounding board for my half baked ideas, stored under blog posts. **To be clear, all work shared here is preliminary and personal unless otherwise noted** (don't blame my school for any of my shoddy work). Critiques are welcome at [jaketg97@gmail.com](mailto:jaketg97@gmail.com).
