I am a Climate Economist based at the <a href='https://ehs.unu.edu/' target="_blank">United Nations University - Institute for Environment and Human Security </a> in Bonn, Germany.  My research focuses on climate change attribution of extreme weather and human responses such as migration, displacement and conflict to human-induced climate change.

I hold a DPhil (PhD) from the University of Oxford in the field of Climate Econometrics and Climate Science.  As a scholar of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, my DPhil was supported by Evangelisches Studienwerk Villigst, while my research was supervised by Prof Fredi Otto.  I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Princeton University's Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment (<a href='https://cpree.princeton.edu/people/lisa-thalheimer' target="_blank">C-PREE</a>) with Prof. Michael Oppenheimer in 2022.
