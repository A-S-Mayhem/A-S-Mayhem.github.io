I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), and expected to graduate in May 2023. I work at the intersection of materials science and machine learning. I am actively seeking full-time employment as a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) and and Data Scientist (DS).

I possess a strong skill set in materials science, machine learning and software engineering. I am eager to bring my expertise and passion to a company where I can continue to learn and make a meaningful impact.

Research Interests
------
* Synchrotron x-ray imaging of laser-matter characterization for failure analysis and quality control
* Applied deep learning and data science
* Automation and machine learning for image analysis
