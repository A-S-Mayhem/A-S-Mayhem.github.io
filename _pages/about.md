# About me

My research interests span the fields of financial economics and game theory. My current research in the field of finance includes topics related to corporate finance, asset pricing, corporate governance, banking and risk management, quantitative finance, fat tails and power laws, central bank communication as well as text analysis. In theoretical economics, I am also quite interested in the fields of contract theory, mechanism design, principal-agent problems and industrial organization.
