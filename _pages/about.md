**Hi! 

I'm a graduate student in economics at UC San Diego. My current reseach interests are in education and consumer finance.

Before graduate school, I was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia where I worked with [Andrew Hertzberg](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/our-people/andrew-hertzberg) and [Igor Livshits](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/our-people/igor-livshits).
