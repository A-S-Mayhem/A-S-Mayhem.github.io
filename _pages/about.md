I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre of Excellence in Oil, Gas and Energy (CoEOGE), in Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), India. I am developing a novel software solution for estimating the trajectory of a Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) for the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). The problem has multiple challenges that require constrained optimization for estimating the trajectory of a strapdown inertial navigation system. I have my doctoral degree from a joint PhD programme of IITB-Monash Research Academy, where I used optimization techniques to develop network based planning solutions for inspecting railway tracks using multiple heterogeneous instrumented wagons. I have a specialisation in Control Systems with a background in Electrical Engineering.
