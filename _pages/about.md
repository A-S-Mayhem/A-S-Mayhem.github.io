I am currently pursuing a PhD in the [Adaptive Brain Lab](https://www.abg.psychol.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Zoe Kourtzi](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/professor-zoe-kourtzi). I have broad research interests, working on the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and psychology.

Before that I was working as a machine learning researcher and engineer at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.

During my MPhil, supervised by [Pascale Fung](http://www.ee.ust.hk/~pascale/), I was doing research on machine learning on non-numerical data, especially social signals. I was also working with [Genta Indra Winata](https://gentaiscool.github.io/) on a virtual therapist self-help platform. We were using machine learning to construct dialogue and model, among others, stress and personality of users.
