I am a graduate student at Arizona State University pursuing M. S. Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity. My interests lie at the intersection of **Software and Network Security and Privacy, Artificial Intelligence, Game Development, and Algorithms.**

I am currently working as a graduate teaching assistant for the course of CSE 545 - Software Security at Arizona State University under [Dr. Erik Trickel](https://www.trickel.com/). I am working on my thesis at [PERSUE Lab](https://persue-lab-asu.github.io/) (PrivatE, Reliable, and SecUrE Computing Lab) under Dr. Rakibul Hasan in field of network security.

I am always looking for opportunities to work on interesting projects. Feel free to reach out to me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aastha-rastogi/).
