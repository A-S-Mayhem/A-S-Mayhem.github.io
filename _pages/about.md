I have a strong background in Machine Learning and Data Science and have my main focus in Probabilistic Machine Learning and interpretability of Deep Learning models.

 <!-- I have a Bachelor's Degree in [Articifial Intelligence and Data](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/undergraduate/undergraduate-programmes-in-danish/bsc-eng-programmes/artificial-intelligence-and-data).  -->

What is this site for? 
======

The purpose of this website is to give any interested reader an insight into the aspects of Machine Learning and Data Science that I've been working with. My main motivation has been to create a platform for me to experiment with writing [blog posts about my daily encounters with Data Science](https://albertkjoller.github.io/posts).  -->
