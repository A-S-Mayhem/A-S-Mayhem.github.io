I am a postodoctoral reseaercher at the Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry (MPI-BPC) at the group of Dr. Juliane Liepe.
Here, my work primarly involves building software pipelines and tools based on machine learning techniques for systematic analysis of large-scale mass-spectrometric data for quantification and prediction of peptides.

Before, I have completed my Dr.-Ing. degree from the Univeristy of Stuttgart working in analysis of robustness in signaling networks under deterministic and stochastic environment. 

Besides, being a computational and systems biologist, I am also a computer science engineer worked on application of spectral graph theory in complex network analysis.
