Thanks for visiting, this site is still under construction!

I am a PhD (DPhil) candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. My research interests are in development, labour, and behavioural economics. I use randomised and natural experiments to help answer policy questions. My current research studies firm and household behaviour in low-income rural settings.

I am also affiliated with the [Centre for the Study of African Economies](https://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/), the [Applied Microeconomics research group](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/applied-microeconomics-0), the [Mind and Behaviour Research Group](https://mbrg.bsg.ox.ac.uk/), and the [Bissau Economics Lab](https://bissaueconomicslab.weebly.com/).
