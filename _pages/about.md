I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Vijay Chidambaram](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/). I am a part of the [UT Systems and Storage Lab](http://utsaslab.cs.utexas.edu/) and the [Lab for Advanced Systems Research](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/lasr/).

**Research interests**

Broadly, my research interests are in and around distributed storage systems. My work primarily focuses on building I/O efficient storage systems for emerging technologies like blockchains and Persistent Memory. Some of my recent work is around building key-value stores and file systems for Persistent Memory.

**Internships**

I was a research intern at Microsoft, Redmond, USA, in the summer of 2020. I worked with [Anirudh Badam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/anbadam/) and the Azure Global Research team on accelerating multi-stream spatio-temporal ML workloads with a new systems infrastructure.

In the summer of 2019, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK. I worked with [Dushyanth Narayanan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dnarayan/), [Ant Rowstron](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/antr/), and the [HSD team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hsd/). We were working on co-designing software and hardware for the [holographic storage medium](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/in-search-for-future-of-cloud-storage-researchers-look-to-holographic-storage-solutions/), which is a part of their [Optics for cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/optics-for-the-cloud/) research program.

I was a research intern at VMware Research, California, USA, in the summer of 2019. I worked with [Michael Wei](https://research.vmware.com/researchers/michael-wei) and [Dahlia Malhi](https://dahliamalkhi.github.io/) to design a new architecture for public blockchains that increases their transaction processing rate.

**Undergraduation**

Before grad school, I was an undergrad at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India (IIIT-H). I received a Bachelors in Technology with Honors in Computer Science, with [Prof. Suresh Purini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m8_F5SoAAAAJ&hl=en) as my advisor. I was a part of the [Software Engineering and Research Center (SERC)](https://serc.iiit.ac.in/), and a proud recipient of the [best all-rounder gold medal](https://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/Telangana/2017-08-12/IIIT-Hyderabad-celebrates-16th-Convocation/318581) for UG-2013 batch.

**Life outside research**

I am trained in [Kuchipudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuchipudi#:~:text=Kuchipudi%20is%20a%20dance%2Ddrama,major%20classical%20dances%20of%20India) (an Indian classical dance form), and I enjoy [dancing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2-7wu9DUyT9yBDYJpBijXw) and painting. In my free time, I like to go out for a run, and recently, I started playing Tennis.
