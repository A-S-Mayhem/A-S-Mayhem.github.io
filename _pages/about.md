Hello I am Zach Mackin!

I just graduated with a degree in Statistics and Computer Science at [University of California Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). My research interests are centered upon Forecasting, Interpretable Deep Learning, Physics-informed Machine Learning, and High-Dimensional Data Analysis. I most recently have done research identfying illegal sand minds with the [UC Berkeley School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/). I am currently reducing risk of wildfires as a member of the Public Safety Power Shutoff team at [PG&E](https://www.pge.com/).

My research is in a multitude of areas such as forcasting human sleep data with the [Center for Human Sleep Science](https://www.humansleepscience.com/), exploring a country's risk of defaulting with the [Economist Intellingence Unit](https://eiu.com),  accounting for growth in pollution within the Chesapeake Bay with the [Chesapeake Legal Alliance](https://chesapeakelegal.org), and effectively developing UAVs with [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).

Additionally, I have extensive teaching experiences within Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Data Science courses.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, golf, disc golf, traveling, and developing forcasts for sports, geopolitics, and existential risk.
