Hi! My name is Kahfi, and I am currently collaborating with Prof. Haryadi Gunawi on the intersection of machine learning and systems. 

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia's top engineering school.

I have a firm background in storage systems and machine learning, with over 2 years of experience in systems research. I envision myself to become an expert in computer systems. 

<span style="color:red">I'm currently applying to the Computer Science Ph.D. program. My main research interests are in storage, machine learning, and distributed systems. I aim to optimize these systems due to the higher increasing demand for space and speed. I'm open to any area of systems research.</span>
