I am an numerical modeler and oceanographerï¼Œmy research focuses on the effects
of ocean surface waves on air-sea momentum and heat fluxes, and their influence
on the atmospheric boundary layer and extreme processes such as tropical cyclone.

I am also the developer of the regional coupled model [FIO-AOW](https://github.com/Biao-Zhao/FIO-AOW).

the goal of my research is to better understand the air-sea-wave coupled processes and to improve tropical 
cyclone and wind energy predictions.
