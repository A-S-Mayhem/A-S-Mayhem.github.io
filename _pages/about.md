I am a Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience in the industry. Currently, I am working as a **Senior Data Scientist** at [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai/).
I am one of the maintainers of the **[TensorFlow-addons](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons)** package. I am also a **Google Developers Expert** in Machine
Learning, and the **first [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html) GDE**. 

In terms of work, my knowledge in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning spans in **T-shape**. Though I have worked in multiple domains, Computer
Vision with Deep Learning is my favorite field to work with. I love simplifying Data Science and Machine Learning concepts, especially the maths behind
them. I love Python, and that's my primary language to work with. You can find some of my education-related content on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aakashnain/code?userId=536977&sortBy=voteCount&tab=profile)

I try to remain updated with the latest research as much as possible. Not only do I read a lot of research papers, but I also annotate them to make them 
simpler to understand. You can visit the [annotated research papers](https://github.com/AakashKumarNain/annotated_research_papers) repo to check out
all the papers I have annotated to date (Star that repo if you are interested in learning about the latest research in the field of Machine Learning and
Deep Learning).

Things I love to discuss:
* Machine and Deep Learning
* Research Papers related to ML/DL
* OSS
* API designs
* MLOps

*Python in breakfast, Machine Learning in lunch, and Deep Learning in dinner!*
