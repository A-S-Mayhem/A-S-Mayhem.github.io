I study computing education from a critical perspective!

I'm a PhD candidate advised by [Aman Yadav](https://www.amanyadav.org/) and a member of the [Justice, Education, and Technology (JET) Lab](https://msujet.org/) in MSU's [Educational Psychology & Educational Technology (EPET)](https://education.msu.edu/cepse/epet/) program.

I will be on the job market starting fall 2024!
