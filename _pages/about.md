I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Yale University. I specialize in international political economy and the political economy of development, with a particular focus on foreign aid.  I also work on the international politics of science and technology. 

Prior to starting the PhD, I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Kosovo. I have a Master's in English literature and a very cute cat named Tara. 

I am a Research Fellow for the Changing Nature of Aid project at the <a href = "https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil/" >Research on International Policy Implementation Lab</a>, an affiliate of the Bridging the Gap program. I co-founded the <a href = "https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/" >Graduate Student International Political Economy (GSIPE) workshop</a>.
