Welcome !


I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Paris-Saclay within [CIRED](http://www.centre-cired.fr/en/) and [PSAE](https://www6.versailles-grignon.inrae.fr/psae_eng/) research units. Here is my [CV](https://RomainFillon.github.io/files/CV_academique.pdf).

I work on climate change and I am particularly interested in climate tipping points and social preferences under risk and uncertainty. I also work with quantitative spatial models.

Feel free to contact me : rfillon@protonmail.com !

Work in progress 
+ "Climate madaladaptation: a dynamic and spatial reappraisal", in progress.
+ "Alternative ethical stances on a possible Amazon rainforest dieback", with T. Gasser (IIASA), C. Guivarch (CIRED) & P. Ciais (LSCE, Paris-Saclay University), in progress.
+ "The uncertain fate of the Amazon rainforest", with T. Gasser (IIASA), C. Guivarch (CIRED) & P. Ciais (LSCE, Paris-Saclay University). Draft available upon request.
