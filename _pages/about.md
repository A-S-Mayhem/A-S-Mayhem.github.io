<p>Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p>

About Me
======
I am currently a PhD student at University College London (UCL) under the supervision of 
(<a href="https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/people/nadia-berthouze/" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Prof Nadia Berthouze</a>). I focus on sensor fusion based ubiquitious computing. I am investigating multimodal machine learning to automatically learn multisensory data communicative features without human intervention to make robust inferences.

Prior to joining UCL, I studied Artificial Intelligence (MSc) under the supervision of (<a href="https://vradu.uk/" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Dr Valentin Radu</a>) and Electronics and Electrical Engineering (BEng), supervised by (<a href="h https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-tughrul-arslan/" style="color:#5dbcd2;">Prof Tughrul Arslan</a>), at the University of Edinburgh.
