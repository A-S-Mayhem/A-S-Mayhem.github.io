Hey there! I am a master's student at University of Chicago working with [Dr. Wilma Bainbridge](https://brainbridgelab.uchicago.edu/) and [Dr. Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) examining memorability and attention using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Previously, I was an undergraduate at University of Alberta working with [Dr. Peggy St Jacques](https://sites.psych.ualberta.ca/MElab/) on investigating the influence of dimensionality on vividness of event-related episodic memory in virtual reality (VR); [Dr. Peter Dixon](https://research.com/u/peter-dixon) on mind wandering and cognitive coupling.

Fall 2024: I will be an incoming PhD student working with [Dr. Brian Levine](https://levinelab.weebly.com/levine-lab.html) to assess how vividness moderates episodic memory and visual imagery in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through a cognitive neuroscience approach!
