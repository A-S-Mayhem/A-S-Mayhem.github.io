Welcome !
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Paris-Saclay University within [CIRED](http://www.centre-cired.fr) and [PSAE](http://www2.agroparistech.fr/PSAE-Paris-Saclay-Applied-Economics.html) research units. Here is my CV.
I work on climate change and I am particularly interested in climate tipping points and social preferences under risk and uncertainty.
Feel free to contact me!
