I am an **[Old Dominion University](https://online.odu.edu/) undergraduate senior majoring in computer science**. I am also enrolled in Old Dominion University’s computer science-accelerated master’s program, where I expect to graduate with my bachelor’s degree in Spring 2024 and my master’s degree in Spring 2025. As a member of the Old Dominion University Perry Honors College, I maintain an overall GPA of 3.94 and a departmental GPA of 3.93.

Technology, exploring different cultures, and continuously learning have been at my life's forefront. I love the thrill of producing creative and innovative solutions in a collaborative environment while continuing to learn from others and from my own experiences.

In December 2023, I began organizing for two local Southwest Florida Meetup communities, [Python SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/pythonswfl/) and the [Tech Alliance of SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/techallianceswfl/).

I am passionate about:
#Technology  #Community  #Travel  #Concerts  #MasteringSpanish
