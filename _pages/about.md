Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)**. My research focuses on development economics, specifically examining the interplay between technology and firms in lower-income countries, particularly in Francophone West Africa. 

My dissertation investigates the adoption and impact of various technologies on small and medium-sized businesses. In particular, I study how relationships between individuals within and across firms influence technology adoption and business outcomes. My research places a special emphasis on digital technologies, which have experienced rapid growth in Africa over the past decade.

In the past eight years, I have been involved in research projects in Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Senegal, and Togo.
