## Who am I?

Hello, I'm Ali Keramati, currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering at University of Tehran. My journey into the world of programming commenced during my high school years and continued to flourish as I pursued my higher education in Computer Engineering. In addition to my major in Computer Engineering, I chose to delve into the fascinating realm of Educational Science, a decision that has significantly enriched my perspective. This exploration was more than a choice; it was a nod to my childhood, shaped by my father's influential career who is an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, introducing me to the world of educational exploration from an early age.

Presently, I proudly serve as an undergraduate research assistant at the prestigious Cognitive System Lab at the University of Tehran. My primary focus revolves around the dynamic intersection of Educational Technology and the utilization of Artificial Intelligence in the realm of education. It's an exciting journey, one that constantly fuels my curiosity and passion for innovative solutions in the field.

## Research Interests

I am passionately dedicated to revolutionizing education through advanced technologies. My research focuses on employing machine learning algorithms, especially reinforcement learning, to create adaptive learning systems tailored to individual students. Additionally, I explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing techniques like fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), to generate personalized educational content. By merging these technologies, my goal is to make learning more engaging, accessible, and effective, shaping a future where education is truly inclusive and personalized for every learner.

As I continue to learn and grow, I am excited to bridge the gap between technology and education, creating innovative solutions that make learning accessible and engaging for all.

## Other Interests

In addition to my passion for technology, I have a deep love for the arts. From painting and music to movies and theater, I find inspiration in various creative forms. Movies and series captivate me, painting is my outlet for creativity, and music fuels my focus during programming sessions. Last summer, I delved into the world of acting and film direction in a school theater named [Tazeh Theater](https://www.instagram.com/tazeh_theater/?hl=en), enhancing my understanding of cinematic storytelling. My interests form a unique blend of technology and creativity, shaping a diverse and fulfilling journey.
