About
======
There is a growing consensus that land models need to be confronted with a wide range of data to constrain uncertainty in parameters, initialize surface states, and address model structural uncertainty. Many land modeling (sub)groups are using data assimilation (DA) to quantify and reduce uncertainty in their land model predictions, and thus to improve their near-term weather forecasts or longer-term climate projections. This work is often highly technically challenging, with many groups working in relative isolation over many months and years to find solutions to these challenges. At the same time, this technical work often is not published in peer reviewed journals, and there limited opportunities to discuss these challenges at regular scientific meetings. In 2020, the [AIMES](https://aimesproject.org) [Land DA Working Group](https://aimesproject.org/ldawg/) was formed with the chief objective of building a collaborative community of land model DA scientists. 

With the objective of building a land DA community in mind, in June 2021 they held a [virtual workshop](https://aimesproject.org/lda_workshop/) on "Tackling Technical Challenges in Land Data Assimilation".
