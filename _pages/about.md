I'm Leonardo Pacciani-Mori /leo&#39;nardo pat&#39;tʃani &#39;mɔːri/, a PhD student in Physics at the University of Padua. I work in the [LIPh lab](https://liphlab.com/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> under the supervision of Prof. Amos Maritan. I have also been appointed as *Fellow of the Department of Physics* at Harvard University, working in [Prof. Murray's group](https://murraylab.fas.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> under the supervision of [Dr. Andrea Giometto](https://scholar.harvard.edu/andreagiometto/home){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.

I work in the broad field of biological physics: I use methods and approaches characteristic of statistical physics to create models of biological and living systems.<br>
My current main research interest is the study of how adaptation in consumer-resource models can help us understand better how microbial systems works, ranging from the dynamics of a single microbe to the coexistence of several species in one community.

<!--### Random fun facts

## My work at a glance
<!--### Collaboration network-->
<p>Below is a network representing my publications and collaborators; the color of each node specifies if it represents <span style="color:#1722C1">co-authors</span>, <span style="color:#90d185">preprints</span>, <span style="color:#138400">publications</span> or <span style="color:#8e20c1">theses</span> (in this case co-authors are supervisors). Hover and click on each node for more information, or drag them around to change the network's shape:</p>

<!--### Talk map
<p>Here, on the other hand, you can find a map of all the places where I've given a talk; the color of each marker specifies if it represents an <span style="color:#CA2C28">invited talk</span>, a <span style="color:#2981CA">contributed talk</span> or a <span style="color:#C7CA28">poster</span> (click any marker for more information).
