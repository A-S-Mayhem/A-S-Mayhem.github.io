Hi! I am currently a staff engineer in the Search Ads team at Baidu Inc., working on developing large language models. Prior to that, I was an algorithm expert in the Ad Tech team at Alibaba Group, honored with "Alibaba-Star" ("阿里星"). I received my Ph.D. degree in June 2021 from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and my B.Eng. degree in June 2016 from Wuhan University (WHU).  


Research Interests
======
My research interests are in **Computational Advertising** and **Generative AI**, and broader interests include reinforcement learning, federated learning, graph neural networks and their applications in advertising, search and recommendation.
