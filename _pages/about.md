Iâ€™m a fifth year PhD candidate in the [Statistics Department](https://statistics.berkeley.edu) graduating in May, 2019. I'm a Fellow at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](http://bids.berkeley.edu). My advisor is [Philip Stark](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/). 

My work lies at the intersection of Statistics and Social Good. I'm interested in using inference to solve simple problems with big impact. I've analyzed data to uncover gender bias in teaching evaluations, evaluate the impact of nutritional policies, and uncover anomalous results in U.S. elections.

Outside of statistics, I am passionate about food and fitness.
