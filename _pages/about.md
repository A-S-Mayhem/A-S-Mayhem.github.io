About
------
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki. I consider myself a multidisciplinary human scientist. I'm interested in what makes humans human, how cultures evolve, and how humans — past and present, across cultural boundaries — have solved everyday problems. My work sits at the intersection of cognitive science, (cognitive) anthropology, cultural evolution, complexity science, and sustainability science. Accordingly with the latter, I (at least try to) apply my research to help preserve a more ecologically and culturally diverse world, along with the rest of our [Past Present Sustainability Research Unit (PAES)](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/organisations/past-present-sustainability-paes). As a researcher, I am interested in the broad methodological palette, ranging from computational methods to ethnographic research. As a human, my fancy is tickled by kayaking, foraging, the outdoors, [photography](https://500px.com/p/roopekaaronen?view=photos), and music. Wherever possible, I try to combine these personal and research interests: I have a firm belief that the best theory emerges from practical knowledge.
