Hello!

I am a 4th year PhD student in the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine program, which combines the resources of Weill Cornell Medical College & Cornell University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Rockefeller University. I am researching the genetic basis of human disease within the labs of Olivier Elemento and Andrew Clark at Cornell's NYC and Ithaca campuses.
