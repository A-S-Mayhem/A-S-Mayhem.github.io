I am a (soon to be) PhD student at the University of Cambridge (starting October 2020). I am working with [Blake Sherwin](http://bccp.berkeley.edu/sherwin/) at the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/). The main focus of my work is on probing the neutrino mass with the help of CMB lensing. I am also joining [Trinity College Cambridge](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/).
I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Physcis from Haverford College in May 2020. At Haverford I worked with [Daniel Grin](http://danielgrin.net/) and [Bruce Partridge](https://www.haverford.edu/users/bpartrid).
