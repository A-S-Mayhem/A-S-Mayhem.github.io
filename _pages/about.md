Hello I am Zach Mackin!

I am a Junior studying Statistics and Data Science at the [University of California Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). My research interests are centered upon Deep Learning, AI Alignment, and Biological Applications of ML. My coursework has been focused on Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science courses. I am currently doing research with the [Center for Human Sleep Science](https://www.humansleepscience.com/). 

I have done research and projects in a multitude of areas such as exploring a country's risk of defaulting with the [Economist Intellingence Unit](https://eiu.com),  accounting for growth in pollution within the Chesapeake Bay with the [Chesapeake Legal Alliance](https://chesapeakelegal.org), and effectively developing UAVs with [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).

Additionally, I have extensive teaching experiences within Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Data Science courses.
