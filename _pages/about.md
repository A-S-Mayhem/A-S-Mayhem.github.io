I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Mannheim and a Doctoral Researcher at ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research. 

My research interests are in applied microeconometrics, with a focus on labour and health economics.

Here is my [CV](http://chiaramalavasi.github.io/files/malavasi_cv.pdf).
