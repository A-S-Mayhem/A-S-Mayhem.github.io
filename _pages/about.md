About Me
=

I am a PhD student in the [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/) and [Visual Information Laboratory](https://vilab.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) at the University of Bristol. I use binary Convolutional Neural Network and other parallel techniques to deploy algorithms on a novel visual device [SCAMP](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/jianing.chen/scamp5d_lib_doc_html/index.html) (under the support of EPSRC [AGILE](https://sites.google.com/view/project-agile/home) project) for robotics-related research and applications. My advisors are Professor [Walterio Mayol-Cuevas](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~wmayol//), Dr [Laurie Bose](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=HRkkhyIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and Dr [Thomas Richardson](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/tom-s-richardson/overview.html) .
