I am first year Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology.

My research interest is the intersction of Deep Learning and Software Engineering. More specifically, I applied Deep Learning into Program Analysis to help software developers to write a good software.

I apply Deep Learning to develops tools and techniques to improve software in real
world systems. Currently my goal is to bring the Deep Learning techniques into
software testing to build intelligent tools to automatically detect the vulnerability in source code.
