Hello I am Zach Mackin!

I am a Junior studying Statistics and Data Science at the [University of California Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). My research interests are centered upon Machine Learning, Computational Biology, and Applied Statistics. My coursework has been focused on Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science courses. I will be beginning a Software Engineering Internship at [Gusto](https://gusto.com/) this summer. 

I have done research and projects in a multitude of areas such as exploring a country's risk of defaulting with the [Economist Intellingence Unit](https://eiu.com),  accounting for growth in pollution within the Chesapeake Bay with the [Chesapeake Legal Alliance](https://chesapeakelegal.org), and effectively developing UAVs with [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).

Additionally, I have extensive teaching experiences within Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Data Science courses.

Thank you for visiting my page! To reach out you can send an email to zachmackin (at) berkeley (dot) edu or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-mackin-408ba51bb/).
