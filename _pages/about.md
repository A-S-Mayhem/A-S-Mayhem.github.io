Hi! I'm Albert - an passionate and engaged Data Science student pursuing a Master's Degree in [Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/Human-Centered-Artificial-Intelligence) at DTU (Technical University of Denmark). I have a strong background in Machine Learning and Data Science and currently put my focus towards topics like Signal Processing, Time Series Analysis and interpretability of Deep Learning models.

 <!-- I have a Bachelor's Degree in [Articifial Intelligence and Data](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/undergraduate/undergraduate-programmes-in-danish/bsc-eng-programmes/artificial-intelligence-and-data).  -->

What is this site for? 
======

The purpose of this website is to give any interested reader an insight into the aspects of Machine Learning and Data Science that I've been working with. My main motivation has been to create a platform for me to experiment with writing [blog posts about my daily encounters with Data Science](https://albertkjoller.github.io/posts) - and most importantly; to write these in a fashion such that the content is interesting both for people that are part of and for people that are not part of the Data Science community. 

Do you have comments on blog posts or want to collaborate on a project?
