Welcome to my website.

I am a Quant at QLS Advisors in Cambridge, MA. Previously, I was a software engineer at Siemens Digital industries software working on computational geometry for the Parasolid geometric kernel used in many CAD/CAE/CAM packages.

I obtained a BSc in Mathematics at Imperial College London and a MSc in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Oxford. I then graduated from Harvard University with a ME in Computational Science and Engineering where I was fortunate to be advised by Pavlos Protopapas and Marios Mattheakis.

My Erd≈ës number is 4. I like Machine Learning and Network Science.
