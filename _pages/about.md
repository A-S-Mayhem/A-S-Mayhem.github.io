Chen is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, with a research focus on NLP and computer vision. He feels fortunate to be working with [Professor Chris](https://people.cs.vt.edu/chris/) on his research. He possesses a keen interest in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Chen has gained extensive expertise in multimodal learning, knowledge graph construction, and pre-trained language models. Specifically, his Master's research project revolves around developing techniques for representing knowledge from various multimedia sources and generating hypotheses. His significant contribution lies in building a multimodal multi-document knowledge graph for detecting disinformation. Before pursuing his graduate studies, Chen completed a Bachelor's degree in engineering at the National Changhua University of Education.
