Thanks for stopping by. My name is Siqi and I am a PhD student under the advisement of Professor [Liu Nan](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/directory/detail/liu-nan) at Duke-NUS Medical School, Aug 2021 intake.

I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in both Statistics and Mathematics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
