I research K-12 CS education, specifically teaching the social impact of computing!

I'm a PhD student advised by [Aman Yadav](https://www.amanyadav.org/) and a member of the [Justice, Education, and Technology (JET) Lab](https://msujet.org/). My work is at the intersection of K-12 education, computer science, and social justice.
