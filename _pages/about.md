Welcome to WE lab, our lab focuses on the representation and prediction of emotion, particularly in the context of emotional disorders such as depression. The aim is to explore how individuals identify and understand their own and others' emotions. The core objective is to uncover the cognitive and neural mechanisms of emotional representation, to more accurately predict and regulate emotional responses. To achieve this goal, we employ a multidisciplinary and comprehensive methodological approach, combining functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Experience Sampling Method (ESM), Polygraphy, Electroencephalography (EEG), Computational Modeling, and behavioral experiments. We hope our research not only contributes to a deeper understanding of the normal process of emotional representation but also offers new perspectives and tools for the diagnosis and treatment of emotional disorders such as depression.
