I am a PhD candidate in the department of Computer Science department at University of California, Davis, working with [Hao-Chuan Wang](http://www.haochuanwang.info/). My broad research interests are Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Data Science, with a focus on issues of collaboration and social interaction, including peer production, peer support, collaborative consumption, crowdsourcing, online informal learning, and social computating. 


I hold a B.S. in Statistics from Hunan University (2016) and an M.S. in Statistics from University of California, Davis (2018).
