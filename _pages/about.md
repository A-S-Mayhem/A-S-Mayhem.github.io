## Currently

I am a PhD Candidate in the Chemical and System Biology Department at Stanford. I am  working on my thesis in the laboratory of Stephen Quake. We aim to develop new technological approaches that solve fundamental and medical problems of interest. 

I am particularly interested in understanding the dynamics of the immune system and the application of this knowledge towards creating better cell-based therapies.


## Previously

I studied Biochemistry at Claremont McKenna College. My first interest in biological research was sparked by Mary Hatcher-Skeers and  Bryan Thines who co-taught an integrated Biology and Chemistry course. 

I then had the great pleasure of working performing my undergraduate research with Babak Sanii. We worked on understanding the biophysical properties of supported lipid bilayers, with the broad goal of developing bio-compatible sensors and devices. 

After graduating, I worked at MiRagen Therapeutics in Boulder, Colorado. While there, I learned about the pre-clinical drug development process from the masters: Corrie Gallant-Behm and Joseph Piper.
