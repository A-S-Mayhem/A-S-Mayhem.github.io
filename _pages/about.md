I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre of Excellence in Oil, Gas and Energy (CoEOGE), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), India. I work on novel software solution for estimating the trajectory of a Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG), in colaboration with the Pipeline Research Division of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). I use online EKF based and offline optimization based estimation methods for estimating PIG trajectory. I have my doctoral degree from a joint PhD programme of IITB-Monash Research Academy, where I developed optimization techniques for network based planning solutions to inspect railway tracks using multiple heterogeneous instrumented wagons. I have a specialisation in Control Systems with a background in Electrical Engineering.
