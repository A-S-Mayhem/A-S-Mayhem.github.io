**Researcher** (Earth Sciences lab) at **Prayoga Insititute of Education Research**, Bengaluru

Biraj is working on the complex processes that connect rocks, water, and life. His deep interest lies in integrating geoscience, mineralogy, biogeochemistry, and geomicrobiology for studying the impact of climate change and environmental pollution on water and food for sustainable future. As a geoscientist, the scientific tools that fascinate him most include geo-thermochronometric dating, luminescence dating, geomorphometric analysis, reactive transport modeling, and Bayesian deep learning. These tools can provide data about erosion and weathering patterns, regolith formation, and biogeochemical cycling from sediment, rock, and soil samples. Integrating these data can help in understanding how natural processes and humans shape Earth's surface in making our Earth habitable, and this, in turn, can enable better management of Earth's resources effectively and efficiently.
