Welcome!

I am pre-doctoral fellow at the [Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago](https://epic.uchicago.edu/) with Professors Thom Covert (Booth), Ryan Kellogg (Harris) and Rich Sweeney (Boston College). I work on projects focusing on the relationship between misallocation of resources, firm learning, and lease terms on productivity in the US fracking industry. My broad research interests lie in industrial organization, environmental economics, and empirical law and economics.

Prior to joining EPIC, I was a Tobin pre-doctoral fellow at Yale Law School where I worked with Ian Ayres on topics such as corporate finance, behavioral economics, and gun policy. I graduated from Grinnell College with double major in economics and math in 2020 where I also played tennis. I have worked on a variety of technology policy issues at the Brookings Institution, American Action Forum, and TechFreedom in the past. I also spent a summer working as an economic consultant at the Brattle Group in Washington DC.

I enjoy playing tennis and running in my free time.
