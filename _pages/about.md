***Hello, and welcome to my academic page!***


I'm a third-year graduate student from the [School of Management](http://en.som.zju.edu.cn/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). 

In my spare time, I'm an avid reader and a passionate traveler. My favorite book is "Gone with the Wind" because I admire Scarlett's energy and her unyielding spirit. 

When it comes to traveling, I've explored several famous cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Kunming, and Lanzhou. Last summer, I embarked on my first international adventure to Osaka, Japan, which left a lasting impression on me with its unique culture and breathtaking landscapes. I'm eager to continue expanding my horizons and experiencing the wonders of the world.

### Education

I earned my Bachelor's in Transportation Engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2021. I am about to complete my Master's in Management Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University in March 2024.

During my academic journey, I was fortunate to receive several awards:


- Outstanding Postgraduates of Zhejiang University in 2022
- Outstanding Graduate of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2021
- National Scholarship in 2020


### Research Interests

My research interests revolve around optimization. I am particularly fascinated by optimization in traffic and inventory management. My work aims to find efficient and quick solutions to real-life problems. I am also interested in machine learning methods.
