I am a Ph.D. student in the **Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington**, advised by Professor Siddhartha Srinivasa ([Personal Robotics Lab](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/)) and Professor Dieter Fox ([Robotics and State Estimation Lab](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/people/)). My research interests are in the areas of **perception**, **representation**, and **planning** for robot manipulation.

Before my Ph.D., I completed my Bachelor of Applied Science in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) with a specialization in Robotics and a minor in AI at the University of Toronto. There, I conducted research on Learning-based Perception for Transparent Objects, advised by [Prof. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/) and [Prof. Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/). Apart from my academic pursuits, I have worked as a research intern at Huawei Technologies R&D Canada, computer vision intern at EATLAB, and undergraduate research assistant at the National University of Singapore.

I have been honored to receive the [CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award](https://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/#2022) - Honourable Mention and the [National Undergraduate Research Award (NSERC USRA)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp) in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

I have had the priviledge to work with some amazing collaborators, and am always looking for motivated students and new collaborations. Drop me an email if you are interested!
