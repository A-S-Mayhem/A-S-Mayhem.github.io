I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/).

My research interests include robotics (optimal control, MPC) and machine learning. Spefically, I'm interested in contact-rich manipulation and legged locomotion -- enabling robot to interact with complex real-world environments.

Over the last two years of my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti) at the [Machine in Motion Lab, NYU](https://www.machinesinmotion.org/), where I focused on Optimal Control and Model Predictive Control (MPC). In the summer of 2023, I was furtunate to have the opportunity of working under the guidance of [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng) at the [AI4CE Lab, NYU](https://ai4ce.github.io/), on an Egocentric action prediction algorithm using LSTM for Human Robot Interaction.
