I am a Full Professor of Information Systems Engineering at the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Management](https://www.iim.ftn.uns.ac.rs/) of the [Faculty of Technical Sciences](http://ftn.uns.ac.rs), [University of Novi Sad](http://www.uns.ac.rs/), Serbia.

Since March 18th, 2021 I have been dedicating most of my time and effort to developing and heading [The Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Institute of Serbia](http://www.ivi.ac.rs/).

Since July 2019, I have transitioned into the role of Ambassador for [Tandemlaunch](http://www.tandemlaunch.com), a unique startup foundry based in Montreal, Canada. If you would like to start a deep tech startup, let me know. 

Since April 3rd, 2019 I am also an [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/education/) University Ambassador. If you would like me to organize a free Deep Learning training workshop at your university or conference, let me know. 

I spent two years (2013-2015) as a postdoc researcher at the University of Trento, Italy with the [Multimedia and Human Understanding Group](http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/). 

On my more recent sabbatical (2018-2019) I manned the post of Senior Research Scientist at Tandemlaunch.  

While pursuing my PhD degree (2003-2006) at the [Florida Atlantic University](http://www.fau.edu), USA I was affiliated with the Center for Coastline Security and the Center for Cryptology and Information Security.

My current research interests include: Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Data Science, Multimedia, Visual Attention, Image/Video Processing.

I am extremely lazy when it comes to updating my web page, so you would be safer with tracking my professional work on GoogleScholar and LinkedIn, using the links in the sidebar.
