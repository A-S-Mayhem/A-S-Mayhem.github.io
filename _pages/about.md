I'm a Masters student in Political Science at the University of Copenhagen. I work as a Research Assistant at Aarhus University, where I work on the project "The New Politics of the Housing Market", which is led by Associate Professor [Martin Vin√¶s Larsen](https://www.martinvlarsen.com/). In the Spring of 2023, I was a Visiting Student Research Collaborator at [The Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu/) and the Department of Politics at Princeton University.

My research interests lie in welfare state development, the politics of housing, redistributive attitudes and the interplay of markets and states. I aim to pursue a PhD in Political Science with a focus on Comparative Politics, Political Behavior and Quantitative Methods.

In my spare time, I'm a happy resident of the [Egmont H. Petersen dormitory](http://www.ehp.dk/en), where I try to make a new dish when it's my turn to cook for the comunal dinner. I hold three passports, and I used one of them to become the [second best handball goalkeeper on the second worst team in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Men%27s_Junior_World_Handball_Championship). I had stage IV Classic Hodgkin lymphoma in 2022, which I wrote [this article about](https://www.berlingske.dk/kronikker/fremskridt-bliver-konkret-naar-man-faar-kraeft-som-22-aarig). I'm all good now, but not as [wise as I thought I'd be](http://medandreord.dk/jeg-troede-at-jeg-ville-blive-klogere/). I intend to become a tennis player, but struggling to find players on the same mediocre level. If you want to play tennis, discuss research or anything else, don't hesitate to reach out!
