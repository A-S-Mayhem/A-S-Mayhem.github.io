Hi! I'm Chris, a data integration analyst in the [d3B center](https://d3b.center/) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. There, I'm responsible for building and maintaining data pipelines to bring clinical data and genomic data to open-access portals allowing scientists to study the genetics behind pediatric cancer. I also help to make our operations more performant and cost-efficient.

Outside of the office, I make beer and I woodwork.
