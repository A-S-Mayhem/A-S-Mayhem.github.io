    <p>Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the <strong><a href="https://economics.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT)</strong>. My research is in development economics, focusing on <strong>technology and firms</strong> in lower-income countries, particularly in Francophone West Africa.</p>
    <p>My dissertation investigates the adoption and impact of technologies on small and medium-sized businesses, with a particular focus on digital technologies. I examine how relationships within and between firms influence technology adoption and business outcomes.</p>
    <p>Over the past eight years, I have conducted research projects in Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Senegal, and Togo. </p>
