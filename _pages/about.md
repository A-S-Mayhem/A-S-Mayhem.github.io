Selected Projects
======

- Credit Risk Project for authorisation strategies
While working at Murex I have been investigating different authorisation strategies for calculating counterparty credit risk (Pre-Settlement Risk, Settlement Risk) from an analytical point of view. the project involved implementing algorithms that can handle large volumes of trades. Important results range from determining the scenarios where the alternative strategies for calculating risk perform badly (underestimate the exposure) to analysing Monte Carlo simulations and percentage growth of the strategies.

- Final Year Thesis
My Undergraduate thesis investigated the Finite Element Method for 1D and 2D differential equations (Laplace Equation, Heat Equation) and Elliptic PDE's. I created MATLAB programs that solve these differential equations using numerical quadrature and applied the method to the Black-Scholes equation for Euorpean Call/Put Options.

- Miscellaneous projects in Probability + Python
Here I have gathered some short projects that have been interesting to read about/research. Included will be a short paper with some code that you can run yourself!
