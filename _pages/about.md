I am Ethan Landers, a computer science undergraduate senior studying with Old Dominion University's ODUGlobal.  I am enrolled in the ODU Computer Science Linked Program, where I can take four master's courses in my senior year of undergraduate studies.  I am also a part of the ODU Perry Honors College.

## Work Experience
I worked full-time alongside a Ph.D. professor and several graduate assistants at Old Dominion University on disinformation detection and analytics research funded by the National Science Foundation through their **Research Experience for Undergraduates** (REU) program for the summer of 2022.

I participated in Old Dominion University's spring 2023 **Innovate Cyber** experiential learning opportunity, where I utilized design thinking with peers to create and eventually pitch a cyber hygiene prototype regarding integrating cyber hygiene learning into Virginia K-12 computer classes.

I participated in a program through a partnership with Old Dominion University and NASA called **NASA@MyLibrary** from October 2021 to June 2023, where I coordinated with libraries across the United States to create and host STEM educational programs via Zoom for their audiences to meet their individual needs.

## Publications
I was [published](https://github.com/ethanlanders/ethanlanders.github.io/assets/95720144/2421c309-4e08-42e9-80fa-2181bf4f54cf) as coauthor for my REU research findings in a publication titled "MSVEC: A Multidomain Testing Dataset for Scientific Claim
Verification" in the 8th National Workshop for REU Research in Networking and Systems (REUNS 2023).


## Awards
Since my enrollment at Old Dominion University, I have earned three scholarship awards: the **Cranmer-Skinner Honors Scholarship** in 2023, the **Richard T. and Nancy P. Cheng Award in Computer Science** in 2022, and the **Old Dominion University Presidential Scholarship** in 2020.
