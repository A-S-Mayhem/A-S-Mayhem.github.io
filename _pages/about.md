<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Yuke Wang is a third-year Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu">computer science</a> at University of California, Santa Barbara (<a href="https://ucsb.edu">UCSB</a>). He got B.E. in software engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (<a href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/">UESTC</a>).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
At UCSB, he is working with Prof <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yufeiding/">Yufei Ding</a>. His research interests include high-performance computing and deep learning algorithms. His recent ongoing projects cover graph neural network (GNN) optimization and its acceleration on GPUs.
<!-- His major interest is the irregular nature of the graph-related problem that significantly impedes the modern massively parallel GPU hardware from achieving satisfying performance. Therefore, he is particularly focusing on bridging such a gap between the upper-level application and underlying hardware will have a profound impact on the end-user experience. -->
<!-- I have been working on projects in software-hardware co-design for distance-related algorithms, such as KNN, KMeans. I am also interested in deep learning, especially graph neural network (GNN) optimization and acceleration on heterogeneous platforms, such as GPUs. -->
