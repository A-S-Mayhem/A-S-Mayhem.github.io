I'm a Computer Science Ph.D student working with [Earlence Fernandes](http://www.earlence.com/) in the [MadS&P Research Group](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/).
I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the Univeristy of Michigan-Ann Arbor

My research interests lie broadly in the field of computer security, with focuses on system security, network security, and human-computer interaction relating to security.
