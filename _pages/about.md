Hi! Iâ€™m Reza, a Computer Engineering graduate student at <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en" style="color: #0011DB; text-decoration: underline;"> Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnique)</a>, focusing on machine learning, signals, and embedded systems..

I focus on developing efficient and secure hardware accelerator systems, with an emphasis on AI and machine learning algorithms that can seamlessly integrate with the physical world, such as developing software-defined platforms on reconfigurable systems like FPGA and designing hardware data re-organization engines for real-time systems

Currently, I'm a research assistant at Tehran Polytechnique.

**My Research Interests include:**
- AI Hardware Accelerator
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Signal Processing
- Parallel and Distributed Systems
- Real-time and Embedded Systems
