<!--[academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)
[_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml)

Getting started
======
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section 

The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

**Markdown generator**
(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator) 
I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.

I am working toward a PhD in Applied and Interdisciplinary Math (AIM) and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I started my PhD program in Fall of 2023, after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Applied Math, quantum mechanics concentration. I am also a 2023-2024 Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (MICDE) Fellow.

My research interests are developing numerical methods that better resolve complex physical constraints, such as complicated geometry or reducing computational cost of current methods. Currently, I am working with [Prof. Shravan Veerapaneni](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~shravan/), [Prof. Eduardo Corona](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/eduardo-corona), and [Dr. Leo Crowder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-crowder-082190157), on a large-scale low-Re flow simulation.
