I am an rising junior computer science undergraduate student at Old Dominion University.  I have been apart of a project called NASA@MyLibrary where I educate library audiences about STEM.  For the summer of 2022, I was accepted into a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program at ODU where I research disinformation detection and analytics full time.
