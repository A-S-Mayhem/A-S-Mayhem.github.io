Hi, I'm Paschal
I'm a PhD student at Purdue University's school of Electrical and Computer Engineering, currently advised by Prof Jamie Davis.

My work sits at the intersection of software engineering, security and cyber-physical systems. I want to improve the security and safety of embedded systems, through well-engineered software.
I am currently studying software vulnerabilities in Real Time Operating Systems, and my results will influence vulnerability detection, and exploit mitigation in these understudied class of system.

Outside research, I love discussing politics, startups and ideas. I am passionate about Nigeria, and Africa, and hope to contribute to the growth of the country, and continent.
