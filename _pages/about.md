I am a fourth year doctoral student at MIT's [Operations Research Center](http://orc.mit.edu/), advised by Prof. [Dimitris Bertsimas](http://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/). My primary research interests lie at the interface of Optimization and Machine Learning with applications in Healthcare and Finance. Specifically, I work on designing novel Optimization algorithms for Machine Learning problems using tools from Robust and Discrete Optimization.

Prior to joining MIT, I worked at [Google Research](https://research.google.com/) and [IBM T.J. Watson Research Center](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/) as a research associate. I earned an Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computer Science from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).
