About Me
======
I am a PhD student in the [Soft Robotics Group (SoftLab)](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/softlab/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) and [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/). 

I use computer-based simulation, optimisation algorithms and machine learning to automate the design of soft proprioceptive sensors. My advisors are Dr Helmut Hauser and Professor Jonathan Rossiter.
