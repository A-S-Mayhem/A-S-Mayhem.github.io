ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm William Drew

What I'm interested in
======

Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of medicine and computer science by advancing neuroscience research with machine learning to expand our understanding of brain networks and how we might treat neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

What I'm up to
======

Currently, I am a first year MD/PhD student at the [Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons](https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu/).

Previously, I was a Data Analyst at the [Center for Brain Circuit Therpeutics](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/neurosciences-center/center-for-brain-circuit-therapeutics) at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/).

There, I was in charge of the Center's computational infrastructure and computational methods development. In addition to supporting research at the Center, I also developed new ways to investigate lesion network mapping and other types of functional connectivity analyses. In particular, I am developing a set of new tools involving what I call the Precomputed Functional Connectome, a high-resolution voxel-wise atlas of functional connectivity in the brain. Check out what I'm working on [here](https://github.com/thewilliamdrew/pfc-toolkit).
