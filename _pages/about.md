I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, studying Human-Computer Interaction with Profs. Brian Bailey and Karrie Karahalios. My research interests include team formation, STEM education, algorithm awareness, and crowdsourcing. I am also a Graduate Measurement Science and Engineering Fellow with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, working with Michael Brundage, Thurston Sexton, and the Knowledge Extraction Application team in NIST's Engineering Laboratory.

I previously earned my B.A. summa cum laude from Knox College in Galesburg, IL with a major in Computer Science and a self-designed minor in Renaissance/Medieval Studies. I have always been interested in both fields, and in addition to my current research, I am particularly excited about projects that combine the two areas.

When not studying or working at school, I also run a small craft business, Realms of Legend (realmsoflegend.etsy.com), for which I create handmade items inspired by fantasy and sci-fi series that I love, as well as past eras of our own world.
