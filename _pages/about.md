Hi, welcome to my personal website! I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Imaging and Innovation and Research (CAI2R), Department of Radiology, New York University, Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA. I received my PhD degree at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech), at the Center for Computational and Data-Intensive Science and Engineering (CDISE), Moscow, Russian Federation in 2020. I was a one-year (2019) visiting PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE), Cambridge, MA, USA. I received my Diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2016. I grew up in Athens, Greece and attended high school at the Arsakeia-Tositseia Schools of Psychiko.

My resreach interests are focused on computational methods and machine learning algorithms for problems in biomedical imaging and bioengineering. Precisely, I am developing computational electromagnetic simulation tools based on integral equation methods and numerical linear algebra algorithms (matrix & tensor decompositions). I am using these algorithms for radiofrequency coil design, parallel magnetic resonance imaging and electrical property tomography. Other areas that I highly interested in are inverse problems and deep learning.
