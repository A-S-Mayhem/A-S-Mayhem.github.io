Hi, I am Ata Otaran. I am a researcher in the field of robotics, virtual reality and haptic interaction. I develop tangible and smart interfaces that can interact with humans and the environment through haptic interaction. I am interested in combining robotics and human perception knowledge to design novel interfaces. 

Lately, I have been working on the design and simulation of nature-inspired metamaterial-based shape-changing interfaces. I have been also collaborating in or supervising many other projects on haptics, virtual reality and wearable robotics.

On this website, you’ll find highlights of my research, projects, and publications. Feel free to explore, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect or discuss potential collaborations!
