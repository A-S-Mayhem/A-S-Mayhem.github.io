I'm a Ph.D. student in the UChicago Department of [Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/). I am an observational cosmologist. I am currently focusing on developing high-precision local distance indicators, like the JAGB method and tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), to measure the Hubble constant. 
I received my B.A. in physics at [Penn](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/) in 2019.
