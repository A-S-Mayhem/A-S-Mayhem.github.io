I'm a Research Engineer at the [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/), Tübingen, Germany. 
I work at the [Perceiving Systems Department](https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackAtBrown) 
directed by [Michael Black](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/black).
My research primarily is about machine learning for computer vision and computer graphics with the focus on 3D human and animal body in motion.
My motivation at work is to try answering these questions:
Can we build intelligent systems that can perceive, and understand human and animal interaction with the 3D world with nothing more than image inputs?
Can we make that system produce similar levels of realism while interacting with the virtual reality? 

The main source of data that I work with comes in form of monocular videos, images,
and time-sequence marker trajectories captured by marker based optical motion capture systems.

I have attended Tabriz Azad University, [Tabriz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWb1yP-KpMc), 
[Iran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuITzmlIvbc) for my undergraduate education, where I received a BSc. in Electrical Engineering.
Afterward, I attended the [Neural Information Processing](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/master/neural-inf-process/) 
program at the [Graduate Training Centre of Neuroscience](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/) in Tübingen, Germany.
