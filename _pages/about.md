## About Me

My name is Tianyang Wang, a third-year undergraduate student at the [School of AI and Advanced Computing](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/school-of-ai-and-advanced-computing), [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/). I specialize in computer vision with a focus on medical imaging. I am passionate about advancing this field and aspire to pursue a PhD in the same area. ðŸŽ“

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jingxin Liu](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/JingxinLiu) at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.
