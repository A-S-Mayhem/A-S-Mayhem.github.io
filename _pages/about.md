Hi! I am from Odisha, India -- a state with wide range of cultural values near east cost of India. I am a Senior Research Fellow in
[Center of Excellence in Space Sciences India](http://www.cessi.in/) 
at [IISER Kolkata](http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/). Currently I am working on numerical simulations to understand the evolution of solar atmosphere. My research is supervised by Prof. Dibyendu Nandy. I have completed my Master's degree on Theoretical Physics from Central University of Himachal Pradesh.
