Contact me at: josh \[dot\] nguyen \[at\] anu \[dot\] edu \[dot\] au

I am an MPhil student at the [Computational Media Lab](http://cm.cecs.anu.edu.au/), the Australian National University, supervised by [Lexing Xie](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/) and [Colin Klein](http://colinklein.org/). Our current project is "Analysing Real-Word Moral Dilemmas from Online Discussions". We are interested in how dilemmas come about, are presented and are justified on social media, and how to automate the reasoning process similar to that observable on online forums.

Previously I graduated with a BSc in computer science from the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/), the University of Melbourne, Australia. 

In the summer of 2019 and winter of 2020, I worked as an intern at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), the University of Sydney, under the supervision of Dr. [Nguyen Tran](https://nguyenhoangtran.github.io/). Our projects focused on distributed optimization and personalization, with an emphasis on designing communication-efficient distributed ML algorithms for federated learning (FL). If you are interested, I suggest taking a look at [this comprehensive survey about FL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04977.pdf).

During my undergraduate studies, I also worked with Dr. [Charl Ras](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/199833-charl-ras) at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/), the University of Melbourne.

I publish under my official Vietnamese name, Tuan Dung Nguyen.
