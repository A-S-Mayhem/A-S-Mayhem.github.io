I am an Economist in the Research Department of the [Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data). My research interests span urban, environmental, and development economics. I received my PhD in 2017 from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was advised by faculty in both the [Department of Economics](https://econ.ucsb.edu/) and the [Bren School](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/).

Before graduate school, I worked for an energy efficiency consulting firm in Austin, TX. My undergraduate degree is from the University of Texas at Austin, where I majored in Latin American Studies ([LLILAS](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/llilas/)) and Economics. Once upon a time, I spent two years at UNT in Denton, TX, thinking I wanted to study music. Before that, I delivered pizza and gassed up boats.
