Background
======

Greetings, and thank you for visiting my portfolio ! I'm Snehal Chaudhari, a software engineer with a passion for solving complex problems with creative solutions. I specialize in developing custom software applications that are optimized for performance and usability. I have extensive experience working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies to stay ahead of the curve. My focus is on developing scalable, reliable software that delivers a seamless user experience.  My experience ranges from developing enterprise-grade web applications to creating mobile apps that delight users. With a focus on creativity, innovation, and performance, I'm dedicated to delivering software solutions that exceed expectations. My portfolio is a showcase of my technical skills and creative flair, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges. 

As a Master of Science student in Computer Science at Arizona State University, Tempe, and a former Software Development Engineer at Avaya, I have gained over two years of full-stack development experience. During this time, I have developed expertise in technical, leadership, and management skills. I have worked on numerous large-scale software releases that required crucial time management skills and knowledge of the latest developments in the field.

Some of my notable accomplishments include contributing to the development of a subscription model of a PBX system, a web-based softphone and call control application, and designing a collaboration service to connect with external applications like Microsoft Teams. These projects allowed me to cater to large-scale problems and apply my skills in designing architecture to establish communication channels within a product ecosystem.

I'm also passionate about the field of Data Analysis and Natural Language Processing, and I have worked on various projects in my spare time to master my proficiency in these fields. My team and I have developed a voice-based payment system for NPCI, taking advantage of the boom in the online payments market with NLP technology. I have also developed a prototype of a deep learning model for generating realistic models to dive deeper into the field of language processing and analysis.

Please take a look at my portfolio to see some of my recent projects, and let's connect to discuss more.
