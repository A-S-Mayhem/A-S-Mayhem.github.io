Hi! I am currently a staff engineer in the Search Ads team at Baidu Inc., working on developing large language models for ad creative generation. Prior to that, I was an algorithm expert in the Ad Tech team at Alibaba Group with honor "Alibaba-Star" ("阿里星"). I received my Ph.D. degree in June 2021 from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and my B.Eng. degree in June 2016 from Wuhan University (WHU).  


Research Interests
======
My research interests are in **Computational Advertising** and **Generative AI**, and broader interests include reinforcement learning, federated learning, graph neural networks and their applications in advertising, search and recommendation.    

During my Ph.D., my research interests were in **Natural Language Processing** and **Computational Social Science**, especially opinion mining and opinionated text generation in low-resource scenarios (e.g., cross-domain transfer, learning with noisy labels and sequence generation with few paired data).
