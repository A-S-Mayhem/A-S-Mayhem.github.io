Welcome to my website !

 

​I am a Postdoctoral Researcher (Instructor) at the Harris School of Public Policy at [The University of Chicago](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/arduino-tomasi). I received my PhD in Political Science from The London School of Economics and Political Science in 2021. 

As a formal theorist of developing countries, my research makes use of game-theoretic models to further our understanding of the electoral consequences of public policies and the economic distortions caused by political frictions. You can find more details about my work here. 

I hold an MRes in Political Science and a MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the LSE, and a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from Universidad Casa Grande (located in my magnificently chaotic hometown Guayaquil, Ecuador).​

I was the student coordinator of the Political Science and Political Economy Doctoral Workshop at the LSE from 2018 to 2020. Professionally, I have worked as an editorial assistant at the American Political Science Review; and, before devoting to research, I served as a legislative advisor at the Ecuadorian Parliament.


A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
