I am a senior Computer Science major and student researcher at Pomona College, currently applying to PhD programs in Computer Science. I am interested in the privacy and security of ML systems as well as the application of ML to system security problems. Apart from this, I am also interested in genetic algorithms, tech policy, and the evolving privacy and security implications of generative AI.

***The overarching goal that I wish to pursue as a researcher is to develop solutions that make technology used in daily life more secure and safe.***

These days, I am working on two projects related to this goal.
* **Securing Federated Learning Against Post-Breach Evasion Attacks**: I am researching and developing evasion attack defense methods for federated learning systems as my senior thesis advised by Dr. Eleanor Birrell and Dr. Anthony Clark.
* **Adversarial Training for Sim-to-Real Transfer**: I am researching adversarial training and its potential benefits for the sim-to-real transferability of computer vision models in order to develop more safe, robust mobile robots with Dr. Anthony Clark's Autonomous Robotics and Complex Systems (ARCS) Lab.

Since May 2021, I have worked for the ARCS Lab, where I focus on researching and developing creative approaches to ease the pain of sim-to-real transfer. Through cybersecurity and software enginnering internships, I have also gained experience in building out ML-driven security solutions and mobile applications.
