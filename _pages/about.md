Welcome! 
======
I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at Sciences Po, working under the supervision of Pierre Cahuc. My research areas include labor economics, and especially labor supply and active labor market policies. I also benefit from the guidance and expertise of Arne Uhlendorff and Antoine Ferey as members of my thesis committee. You can also find more of my research  [here](https://nicolasghio.github.io/research/). <img style="float: right;" src="/images/profile.jpg">

Prior entering the Ph.D. I worked as a research data analyst for Pr. [Jesse Rothstein](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~jrothst/) (UC Berkeley). and as a junior economist at Institut des Politiques Publiques (PSE / CREST) in Paris. You can also find my resume [here](https://nicolasghio.github.io/cv/).
