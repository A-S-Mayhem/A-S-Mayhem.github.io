Yingqiang Wang was born in Jinhua, Zhejiang, China, in 1997. I received my B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in ocean engineering from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2019 and 2024, respectively. From Nov. 2022 to Nov. 2023, I was a visiting Ph.D. student with the Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland.
I have been deeply involved in the development of a passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning system for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation. My research interests include underwater acoustic navigation, marine robotics, and digital signal processing.

Research Interests

### Underwater Acoustic Navigation
Since 2018, I have actively engaged in conducting research on underwater acoustic positioning and navigation, focusing particularly on the passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning system for small AUV navigation. Given the ongoing advancements in miniaturization and swarm applications in marine robotics, I firmly believe that underwater acoustic navigation should assume an essential role.
### Marine Robotics
Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are gaining traction across oceanographic science, offshore industry, and naval defense. The allure of the captivating and enigmatic ocean fuels our innate curiosity for exploration. As we persist in oceanic pursuits, an array of marine robots, particularly innovative ones with enhanced capabilities, will showcase their strengths and play an indispensable role.
### Biomimetic Underwater System
Nature’s inspiration knows no bounds. Many fascinating scientific problems, such as underwater propulsion, navigation, sensing, and communication, can draw inspiration from marine life. For example, if we combine acoustic navigation and communication with agile robotic fish in a biomimetic manner, a swarm of bionic fish will unlock new frontiers in ocean exploration.
