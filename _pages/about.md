I started my Ph.D. in 2019 at UCSB with an emphasis in the field of Experimental and Behavioral Economics. 
I am especially interested in higher-order beliefs, willingness to pay for information, risk preference elicitation, and misinformation.

I studied for my master's degree in Economics at CIDE.
Before, I studied a Specialization in Applied Statistics 
and got a bachelor's degree in Experimental Psychology at UNAM.
