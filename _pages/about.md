I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Cornell University, starting this fall.


Previously, I was a master's student in Mathematics, curriculum 'Stochastics and Data science' at the University of Turin and a [Senior Allievo at Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/education/allievi-honors-program/), where I was supervised by prof [Stefano Favaro](http://sites.carloalberto.org/favaro/). My master thesis was about *Bayesian Nonparametric cardinality estimation from Sketched Data*. 

I obtained my B.sc. in Statistics at the University of Bologna, where I was supervised by [Christian Hennig](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZG9XA4IAAAAJ&hl=en). Here I worked on [quantile-based clustering](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/electronic-journal-of-statistics/volume-13/issue-2/Quantile-based-clustering/10.1214/19-EJS1640.full), exploring new approaches to estimate the 'true' number of clusters.

In a previous life, I used to be a farmer, I completed an agricultural high school and worked as a farmer every summer.

# Research Interest:
*  **Causal Inference** 
* **Statistical Learning Theory and Decision-Making** 
* **Bayesian Nonparametric Statistics**
