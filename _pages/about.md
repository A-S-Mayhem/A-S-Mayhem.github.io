I ([name audio](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/name.m4a)) am a computational social scientist studying politics, organizations, social movements, and inequality. I received my Sociology PhD in 2020 from the University of Arizona. I am currently working as an Assistant Professor of [Sociology](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/sociology//people/faculty/Zhang.php) and [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/) at Stony Brook University. I am also a research affiliate at New York University.

I combine statistical, network, and computational methods with large-scale datasets to study social, political, and organizational behavior. My past work focuses on the interplay between social movements and social or political changes in the U.S. and the globe. These work has been published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/jomf.12419.pdf), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [International Journal of Comparative Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1177/0020715219837752), [American Journal of Sociology](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/Fiel-Zhang-2019_AJS.pdf), and [PLoS One](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/pone.pdf). I have won the 2020 James Coleman Award from Sociology of Education Section at American Sociological Association and the 2021 SIM Best Paper Submission at Academy of Management. 

My ongoing work focuses mainly on understanding the segregation and polarization in the U.S. I am using big data from FEC with corp data to track the polarization/partisanship trend in corporate elites. I am using population mobility data from [SafeGraph](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns) and Facebook to assess the long-term impact of racial segregation. I am also using deep learning methods to detect and monitor anti-AAPI hate speech and incidents (a direct result of polarization and xenophobia) from [Twitter since the COVID-19 outbreak](https://yongjunzhang.com/posts/2021/04/stopaapihate.md/). This project is funded by a seed grant from IACS at Stony Brook University.

I am teaching Intro to Computational Social Science and Research Methods in Sociology at Stony Brook University.
