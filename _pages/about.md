I am current working as an AI Engineer at [ThirdAI](https://thirdai.com) where I mostly work on a 
variety of machine learning and engineering problems. Prior to that, I was a student at
The University of Chicago where I double-majored in Computer Science and Computational and Applied Mathematics. I was fortunate enough to be advised by Professor [Rebecca Willet](https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu/) and to work with Professor [Raul Castro Fernandez](https://raulcastrofernandez.com/).
