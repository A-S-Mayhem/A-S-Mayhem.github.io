I am a PhD student at Monash University working on gamma-ray bursts, neutron stars and gravitational waves under the supervision of Paul Lasky and Greg Ashton.
I am a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and the Australian research council centre for excellence for gravitational-wave discovery, OzGrav.
