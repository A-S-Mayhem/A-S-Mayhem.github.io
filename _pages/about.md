I am a **Information Technology** undergraduate (B.Tech) student at the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, India. Previously, I've lead and worked on a variety of research projects as a Research Assistant and was fortunate enough to have a mentor like [Dr. Suman Mann](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=-oTZzbkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and discovered my fascination for Machine Learning and its broad applications like Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Time-Series Modelling, Image processing, etc.

Currently, I'm working as Computer Vision Intern at CMATER Lab, Jadavpur University, with [Dr. Nibaran Das](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=vMx63B4AAAAJ&hl=en) in the field of healthcare.  Recently, collaborated with a Phd student for classifying and detecting monkeypox. Prior to this, the aim of the research was to build a classification model for White-Blood-Cells (lymphocytes) capable of performing on par with the models encountered in related literature & our model achieved a maximum accuracy of  99.65%.

Also, in the midst when I was researching for a personal project on novel AIâˆ’Image Captioning solution to assist blind people, I encountered and collaborated with honorable [Dr. Srijith P.K](https://iith.ac.in/cse/srijith/)   on the same project at BRAIN Lab, IIT Hyderabad, with [Dr. Srijith P.K]. 

I am inclined toward designing products and finding solutions using theoretical and applied **Machine Learning**, which can help a large number of people improve the way they work and live. I am still exploring the space of problems in this area and have yet to decide on any specific problem on which I would like to do my research.
