I am currently working as a Research Scientist in the research group Learning in Early Childhood at the MPI-CBS, Leipzig, Germany. My main responsibility is to design end-to-end pipelines for processing Neuroimaging data from multiple modalities incorporating varied techniques. 

I completed a B.Sc. (H) Physics in 2018 and a M.Sc. Life Science Informatics in 2020. The reason I went from Physics to Life Science Informatics is that biological systems, particularly the brain are much more complex than the usual systems we study in Physics. My interests in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence also motivated me to study brain mechanisms and the biological plausibility of Neural Network Architectures. 

Apart from my academic interests, I enjoy getting to know new people and perspectives. In my free time I like to read popular science books and dance.
