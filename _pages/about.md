Hi there! My name is Salvador Balkus, and I am an incoming PhD student in Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 

Previously, I graduated with a BS in Data Science from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. As an undergraduate, I worked as a research assistant under Professor Hua Fang in the [Computational Statistics and Data Science Lab](https://www.umassmed.edu/fanglab/), where I prototyped smart health applications for dietary studies and epidemiological modeling. Before that, I also spent time as a research assistant in the UMass Dartmouth Public Policy Center, where I analyzed diverse sets of socioeconomic data to study the Blue Economy as well as social determinants of health.
