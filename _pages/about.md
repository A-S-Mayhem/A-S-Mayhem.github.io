Ezekiel Soremekun is a Research Associate at 
[SnT](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt) 
-- Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, 
at the University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg. 
HE was formerly a researcher 
and PhD Candidate at 
[CISPA](https://cispa.de/en) and 
[Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), respectively. 
He also attended the 
[Saarbr√ºcken Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de).

Ezekiel's research is primarily focused on *software engineering* (SE), especially *software validation*. 
This includes SE research concerns such as automated debugging, software testing, 
program analysis, and security testing. 
He is interested in studying both functional properties (e.g., correctness)
and non-functional properties (e.g., security, robustness, and fairness) of 
software systems, including aritificial intelligence (AI) -driven systems (e.g., automated classifiers). 


Research Statement
-------------------

Ezekiel's research objective is to apply scientific methods to validate software systems. 
Software systems have become increasingly complex, such that it is impossible to ensure their
correctness without systematic validation.

The over-arching research aim is to provide useful validation techniques, tools and empirical data for the following:
   * __Software Testing__: how to systematically exposing unexpected program behaviors, 
   * __Automated Debugging__: how to automatically diagnose, mitigate and repair such incorrect behaviors, 
   * __Human Factors in SE__: studying developer behaviors during software testing and debugging activities, and 
   * __Human-in-the-loop SE__: building testing and debugging tools that account for developer behaviors and interactions in practice. 

The main goal is to address these key challenges 
by developing methods and tools to support developers 
during software testing and debugging activities.
