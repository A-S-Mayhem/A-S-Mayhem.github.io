I am currently pursuing a master's degree in traffic and transportation with the School of Traffic and Transportation, [Lanzhou Jiaotong University](https://www.lzjtu.cn/), Lanzhou, China. I received a B.Eng. in traffic and transportation from Lanzhou Jiaotong University.

Because of a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning, my current research centers on the area of deep learning, automated driving, and transportation big data. I have participated in Coursera's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?) and [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) courses since Aug.2021 and obtained the Online course certificate. Meanwhile, I learned about lane detection and studied the application of self pre-training with masked sequential autoencoders, submitted a paper with this research(August.2022). I participated in [HUAWEI 2022 Global AI Challenge](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/activity/starAI2022/algo/) to study intelligent quality detection of lane rendering data with further understanding of anomaly detection.
  
My graduate thesis is a study of the environmental impact of highway regions using multi-source heterogeneous data (remote sensing imagery, weather station monitoring data, research collected soil data, air pollutant data, noise data, traffic volume data, etc.) and calculating the traffic capacity of highways under environmental constraints.
