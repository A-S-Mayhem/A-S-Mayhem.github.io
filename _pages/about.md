I am currently working for Planet Labs as a *Computer Vision Engineer*. My work involves building tools to automate understanding of satellite images. In particular, I am performing work on building deep learning driven object detection models using medium-to-low resolution images. Prior to joining Planet Labs., I worked for Autel Robotics as a *Computer Vision Engineer* to help the vision team build autonomous flying capability on the next generation drones. To be more specific, I spent most of my time on developing and implementing a highly efficient visual single target tracking algorithm in the Computer Vision team led by Dr. [YoungWoo Seo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~youngwoo/research.html). Before joining the Autel Robotics Computer Vision team, I pursued my **Ph.D**. (2011-2016) in the [Chester F. Carlson Center for the Imaging Science](https://www.cis.rit.edu) at Rochester Institute of Technology under the advisory of Dr. [Matthew. J. Hoffman](https://people.rit.edu/mjhsma/index.html). My Ph.D. thesis concentrated on utilizing a multi-modal optical sensor to detect and track vehicles from a moving and fixed aerial platform. Also, for short term, I conducted research on 3-D MRI Cardiac Segmentation using Graph Cuts to understand the mechanism underlying the cardiac fibrillation. During my Ph.D., I worked for Huawei R&D (2015-2016) as a *Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer Intern* where I worked on extracting the semantics from a family photo album using deep face and contextual features. My supervisor at Huawei R&D was Dr. Dong-ging Zhang. Before my arrival to RIT, I earned my **Masters** Degree (2011) in the [Electrical & Computer Engineering Department](https://www.bridgeport.edu/academics/schools-colleges/school-engineering/departments/electrical-engineering-department/) at University of Bridgeport. Under the advisory of Dr. [Buket Barkana](https://sites.google.com/site/drbuketbarkanaslab/), I conducted research on non-speech environmental sound classification in the Signal Processing Research Group. This work included the design of a new feature set highlighting the range of pitch values of non-speech sounds. Finally, I pursued my **Bachelors** degree (2009) in the [Electrical & Electronics Engineering Department](https://eee.ogu.edu.tr) at Eskisehir Osmangazi University under the advisory of Dr. [Osman Parlaktuna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VpxK5TkAAAAJ&hl=en). My overall research interests lie in the fields of *visual object tracking*, *object detection*, *image segmentation*, and *audio signal classification*.
