I am transitioning my [website](https://www.scottraulerson.com/) from Google Sites over to Github. This transition is a side project I really only work on when I am tired of dissertating. Bare with me as I build it out.


My background
======
Hydrologist and Data Scientist with a background in interdisciplinary water resource problems. Experienced in water resource modeling, geospatial analytics, and environmental data management. 

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate within the Warnell School of Forestry & Natural Resources at the University of Georgia. I received my M.S. in Geosciences with a focus on Water Sciences/Hydrology from Georgia State University in 2018, and my bachelors degree in Environmental Science with a minor in Geology from Georgia College & State University (now Georgia College) in 2016.
