I’m Mehdi Momen, a Statistical and Quantitative Geneticist and a post-doctoral research associcate at the Department of Animal and Poultry Sciences at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT). I am profoundly interested in the world of Statistical Genetics and Genomics and its connection with the organism life. The highly-specific relay of information processed from the outside of the DNA deep into its appearance intrigues me. I’m currently conducting research in this filed in the [Dr. Morota Lab](http://morotalab.org/). I've been trained in various aspects spanning computational genetics and genomics, now it’s time to extend many of which I've learned during my time as a PhD student at SBUK university (Dr. Ayatollahi Mehrgrardi Lab) and visiting student at Wisconsin-Madison University (Prof. Daniel Gianola and Prof. Guilherme Rosa Lab). 


Research Interet 
======
My research interests span a broad range of topics including animal breeding, plant breeding, and human quantitative genetics. I am particularly interested in applying statistical learning methods to multi-layer omic data, dissection of the genetic architecture of complex traits, predictive ability of dense arrays of variants for animal, plant and human populations. The primary research areas I want to focus on, deriving the prediction error variance by using bootstrap aggregation sampling and investigated the relationship between empirical connectedness measures and prediction accuracy in the cross-validation framework. Also demonstrated the potential of non-parametric relationship matrices to quantify genomic connectedness and prediction accuracy in the presence of non-additive gene actions. Subsequently, development of algorithms finds an optimized training set from a larger set of candidate individuals such that it minimizes the prediction error variance in the test set.
