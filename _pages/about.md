I am a 21 years old student fresh graduate with a Bachelor in Economics and Computer Science. Since September 2021 I am attending a MS in Data Science. I decided to do this experiment since I like coding and found an easy template to develop a simple page. You can find more information on my Github page, at the link on the left panel (follow button if you are using your phone). The repo is named after this website. <br>

Future Projects
======
In the future, I would like to conduct some academic research and earn a doctorate degree, so I hope I will be able to fill this website with talks, publications etc. Feel free to explore its primordial form and make any suggestion! I am also interested in having multiple job experiences, so I am happy to consider any offer and actively apply for interesting positions!

Next steps in my career will be earning my Masters' degree in Data Science and a doctorate / work / whatever will be the best option. In the long term, I would love to apply the knowledge I am acquiring in what I call a _human setting_ dealing with people's problems such as health, environment, national security. Nevertheless, no one knows what life brings us, and I like to explore different fields, talk to people, get to experience whatever attracts me. 

About me & not in my CV
======
Born and raised in the Milan metropolitan area, in a small town with a big identity. Atteded a Scientific oriented high school in Milan, to later move to one of the most prestigious (if not the most prestigious) Economics Universities in Italy. In the free time, I enjoy deepening my understanding of what I am studying, spending valuable time alone, seeing friends, cycling, drinking coffee, doing sports, listening to the radio or expanding my music collection. I like to keep myself busy and at the same time find moments of the day in which I kill time, just to keep a balance between activities.
