I recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where I received my B.A. in Physics, with a concentration in Astrophysics. This Fall, I will be starting my Ph.D. in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. 

At Penn, I worked with Gary Bernstein, where my research primarily focused on developing statistical techniques for reconstructing information (such as the power spectrum or the dark matter density field) from large-scale galaxy and lensing survey data. 

In my free time, I love to play soccer, run, and watch Game of Thrones (excluding season 8).
