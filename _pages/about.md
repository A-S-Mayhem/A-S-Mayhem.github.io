I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science at Georgia State University](https://politicalscience.gsu.edu/) in Atlanta, Georgia. I received my BA and MA from [Political Science and International Relations Department at Bogazici University](https://pols.boun.edu.tr/). My current research agenda focuses on political parties, opposition cooperation and coordination, and authoritarian regimes. 

My dissertation research addresses the pre-electoral coalitions formed in electoral autocratic regimes. Substantively, I study opposition coordination and the communication between opposition parties and the incumbent both before and after national-level elections. I adopt a mixed-methodological approach - large-N quantitative analysis, causal case selection, and site-intensive methods - to explore how political parties' organizational structures and ideological and political agenda diversity explain opposition bargaining prior to the elections. In testing my theory, I draw on an original dataset on elections in electoral authoritarian regimes and archival materials, interviews with party chairs and co-chairs, and shadowing insights. I focus on Turkey in my fieldwork, but I also explore elections in Armenia, Guatemala, Hungary, and North Macedonia as influential and pathway cases. 

My dissertation research has been supported by the [Warren E. Miller Fund in Electoral Politics](https://connect.apsanet.org/centennialcenter/research-grants/) supported by the APSA Centennial Grant, Craigie Fellowship, and GSU's [Library Dissertation Award](https://graduate.gsu.edu/dissertation-library-travel-awards/).  

My dissertation project is part of a larger substantive research that seeks to understand the role of political parties in democratization and regime change. My methodological agenda is an extension of my substantive interests and is centered around the development of necessary original data and the synthesis of tools to account for complex causal mechanisms to understand how political parties and elites behave. My research has been published in the *Party Politics*, *Journal of Peace Research*, and *Journal of Civil Society*. My published and working papers can be found on my [publications page](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/publications/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q4RzaGMAAAAJ&hl=en). Access my most current CV [here](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/cv/).

I was the Chair of the [Atlanta Symposium on Political Science](https://sites.google.com/view/asops2023/home?authuser=0) (ASOPS). I also served as elected Ph.D. representative of my department's Diversity and Inclusion Committee. In my free time, I volunteer at [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) or I like to hike, cook, read, and play tennis or tabletop games.
