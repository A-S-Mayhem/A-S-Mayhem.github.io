Delighted to welcome you! I am currently navigating the exhilarating journey of my second year as a Ph.D. student at the prestigious University of Notre Dame. I am blessed to be in the Computer Science and Engineering program, with my advisor being [Dr. Ronald Metoyer](http://sites.nd.edu/ronald-metoyer/).

I have chosen to devote my research efforts to the field of Human-Computer Interaction and Accessibility. My interests lie in diving deep to understand, design, and develop technologies that can augment the life experience of blind or low-vision individuals. The ultimate goal? Creating accessible interactive systems for data visualizations that significantly enhance their understanding and communication.HD.

And, how can I miss introducing my scholarly partner helping navigate the Ph.D. program? Meet Sunny (the adorable doodle you see in the picture). Far from the rigors of research, he's an expert in napping and has an unparalleled ability to beg for treats. His friendly presence adds an extra dash of joy to my academic journey!
