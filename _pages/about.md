I am a 2nd-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). I am supervised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). 

My research interests lie within the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. At the current stage, I am specifically interested in Pre-trained Language Models, Transfer Learning, Contrastive Learning, Knowledge Graph, etc. You can find my CV [here](/cv/).
