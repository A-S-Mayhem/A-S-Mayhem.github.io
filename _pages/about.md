I am an undergraduate student of computer science at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT)](http://www.bupt.edu.cn/). 

I will be a Ph.D student of computer science and engineering at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in the fall of 2023 under the advice of [Prof. Raymond Wong](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/).

I am working on my final year project under the advice of Prof. Raymond Wong, HKUST and [Prof. Jingyu Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H441DjwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), BUPT.

Supported by [BUPT](http://www.bupt.edu.cn/) Computer Science and Technology experimental class, which is an elite program, my current research interest is in mobile computer systems under the advice of [Prof. Mengwei Xu](https://xumengwei.github.io/). Our project cooperates with [Dr. Ting Cao](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ticao/) of [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/).

Jointly supported by [Mitacs globalink research internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) and [China Scholarship Council](https://www.csc.edu.cn/), I am now a visiting student at [the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia](https://ece.ubc.ca/) and my research interest is dynamic graph algorithms under the supervision of [Prof. Matei Ripeanu](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/matei/).
