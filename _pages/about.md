Hi! I am an Graduate Teaching Assistant University of Wyoming! I am PhD Student under supervision of [Dr. Diksha Shukla]([https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/](http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~dshukla/)). 

As a PhD student specializing in machine learning and natural language processing, my passion lies in developing efficient algorithms and models that can solve real-world problems. Along with my skills in software engineering, I have a track record of delivering scalable and well-documented code. I thrive in collaborative environments but am also confident in taking ownership of projects and driving them to completion!
