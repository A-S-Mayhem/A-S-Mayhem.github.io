* I am a Machine Learning Intern @ [Plural AI](https://plural.ai) where  I am working under [Dr Jaron Collis](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Mupl5E0AAAAJ&hl=en) and together with other smart folks, I am trying to revolutionize the world of financial analysis. Mainly working on NLP models.
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine intelligence, reinforcement learning and cognitive science. I am particularly interested in multi-agent learning (specifically, multi-agent reinforcement learning), opponent-modelling, evolutionary dynamics, the theory of mind and combining all of the above to establish intelligent systems which can reason and act in complex environments.
* I received my Bachelor's degree from [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) where I have graduated with a first class honours BASc degree with distinction (Dean's List), majoring in computer science and minoring in economics. My dissertation focused on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in sequential social dilemmas and was advised by Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/Jun.Wang/) and Dr [Manuela Dal Borgo](http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/cto/md762).
