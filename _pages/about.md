I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, [Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html), PA, USA. I am the menber of the Dr. Xiongâ€™s Research Group supervised by [Dr. Chenfeng Xiong](https://www1.villanova.edu/university/engineering/academic-programs/departments/civil-environmental/directory/biodetail.html?mail=chenfeng.xiong@villanova.edu&xsl=bio_long), [Dr. Arash Tavakoli](https://www.arashtavakoli.com/about), and Dr. C. Nataraj. I am dedicating to the development of DL and transportation!

I received my M.Eng. degree in traffic and transportation from Lanzhou Jiaotong University in 2023, and received B.Eng. degree in traffic and transportation from Lanzhou Jiaotong University in 2020.

My current research centers on the area of traffic data analyzing, machine learning, deep learning, automated driving, and transportation big data.
