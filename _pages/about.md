I am a geoscientist interested in measurement tools that can reveal erosion and weathering patterns, regolith formation, and biogeochemical cycling from sediment, rock, and soil. These tools include geo-thermochronometric dating, luminescence dating, geomorphometric analysis, and reactive transport modeling. Integrating these measurements can help in understanding the connection between life and landscape and making progress in understanding how natural processes and humans shape Earth's surface.
