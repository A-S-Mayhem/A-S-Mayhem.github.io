I am a second year Applied Mathematics Ph.D. student in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) at [Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu).

## News
## July 2022 - I just received the Fundação Estudar Leadership Fellowship. 
The Fellowship aims to support, bring together, and develop Brazil's most promising young people that can generate positive transformations in their sector of activity, whatever it may be. This is the most competitive Fellowship for Brazilians. The process started with 33.876 candidates, and only 30 received this Fellowship (0.088% acceptance rate).
