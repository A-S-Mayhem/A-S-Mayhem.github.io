Hello! I'm a dedicated post-doctoral researcher at RMIT University's Intelligent Automation Research Group in Australia, specializing in machine learning and computer vision. My journey in this fascinating field began at the same institution, where I earned my Ph.D. in 2022, mentored by esteemed [Prof. Alireza Bab-Hadiashar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-bab-hadiashar-0a881a31/), [Prof. Reza Hoseinnezhad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rezahn/) and [Dr Ruwan Tennakoon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruwan-tennakoon-923a3437/). My research delves into diverse areas including representation learning, domain adaptation and generalization, Bayesian deep learning, geometric vision, and more.

Beyond research, I bring a wealth of experience in teaching, having served as a tutor and lab demonstrator for Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses at RMIT University. My teaching journey extends to foundational courses in Digital Fundamentals and Introduction to Mechatronics. I pride myself on being an active reviewer for prestigious computer vision conferences such as ICCV and CVPR.

My passion lies not only in advancing theoretical knowledge but also in applying these insights to solve real-world industrial challenges. This dual focus fuels my commitment to lifelong learning and continuous improvement in the realms of machine learning and computer vision. Outside the lab, I find joy in reading&#128214;, fishing&#127907;, and indulging in my love for coffee coffee&#9749;.

Thank you for stopping by to learn about my professional journey and interests. I'm always open to collaborative opportunities and discussions in the fields of ML and CV. Let's connect!
