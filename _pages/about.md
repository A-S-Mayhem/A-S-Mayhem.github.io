<div style="text-align: justify;"><br>

<br><br>Welcome to my website !

 

​I am a Postdoctoral Researcher (Instructor) at the Harris School of Public Policy at [The University of Chicago](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/arduino-tomasi). I received my PhD in Political Science from The London School of Economics and Political Science in 2021. 

As a formal theorist of developing countries, my research makes use of game-theoretic models to further our understanding of the electoral consequences of public policies and the economic distortions caused by political frictions. You can find more details about my work here. 

I hold an MRes in Political Science and a MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the LSE, and a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from Universidad Casa Grande (located in my magnificently chaotic hometown Guayaquil, Ecuador).​

I was the student coordinator of the Political Science and Political Economy Doctoral Workshop at the LSE from 2018 to 2020. Professionally, I have worked as an editorial assistant at the American Political Science Review; and, before devoting to research, I served as a legislative advisor at the Ecuadorian Parliament.
