I am a 4th year graduate student at Harvard in the Physics Department working on the intersection of machine learning, astrostatistics, and the interstellar medium. My Ph.D. advisor is [Douglas Finkbeiner](https://faun.rc.fas.harvard.edu/nebel/dfink/){:target="_blank"}.

I am passionate about scientific communication, open source software/data availability, and the replication crisis. I am also a Julia enthusiast. Please reach out to me for any questions related to my research and explore the site!

In previous lives, I have also been a synthetic chemist, chemical spectroscopist, fabrication engineer, and dilution refrigerator operator and have deeply loved each of these roles.
