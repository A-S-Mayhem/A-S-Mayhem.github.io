I am a research fellow at Stanford (Rock Center and Olin Program in Law and Economics). My research focuses on the application of behavioral insights to competition policy, corporate governance, economic regulation, and the empirical analysis of law and its policy implications. I have formal training in law, economic theory, econometrics, and behavioral science. I am mostly interested in analyzing the social desirability of laws.

I was born in Santiago, Chile. I lived there until 2015, when I started my grad studies at Harvard. Before moving to the US, I worked for the Chilean antitrust authority. Before coming to the Bay Area, I spent a year in Mexico City, where I worked as a competition expert for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) conducting a competition assessment of the Mexican pharmaceutical sector.

I have taught seminars on antitrust and law and economics in Chile and Italy, and Econ 154 (Law and Economics) at the Stanford Department of Economics.

Besides academia, my passions are soccer, hiking, and song-writing.
