I am a recent graduate of The University of Chicago where I double-majored in Computational and Applied Mathematics and Computer 
Science. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Rebecca Willet](https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu/). Now I'm currently 
working as an AI Engineer at [ThirdAI Corp.](https://thirdai.com).
