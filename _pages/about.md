I am a PhD student at [IMT Lucca](https://www.imtlucca.it/en) in the <a href="http://dysco.imtlucca.it/" target="_blank">Dynamical Systems, Control, and Optimization (DYSCO)</a> [Dynamical Systems, Control, and Optimization (DYSCO)](http://dysco.imtlucca.it/) research group. I am advised by [Prof. Alberto Bemporad](http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/). My research interests are **system identification**, **machine learning**, **neural networks**, **parameter estimation**, and **numerical optimization**. My research focuses on dynamical systems theory for continuous-time embedded optimization algorithms of machine learning.

I received my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics in 2016 from the [University of Ilorin](https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/) in Nigeria. I obtained a master’s degree in Mathematical Sciences in 2018 from the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Cameroon](https://aims-cameroon.org/), and in 2021, a master’s degree in Machine Intelligence through the [African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI)](https://aimsammi.org/) program at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Rwanda](https://aims.ac.rw/).
