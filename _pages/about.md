I am a second-year PhD student at LAMSADE, under the supervision of Denis Cornaz and Cl√©ment Royer.
My thesis focuses on the study of PSSs (positive spanning sets), families of vectors spanning the whole euclidian space by combinations with positive coefficients. Using graph theory, I study the structure of such families. I also look for new ways to use PSSs in derivative-free algorithms.
