I am currently an Associate Technical Writer based in Scottsdale, Arizona at [Paradox](https://www.paradox.ai/), a company reimagining the future of hiring and recruiting.

With a diverse background in technical writing for SaaS companies across various sectors—such as legal, financial, and healthcare—and experience in digital forensics as a sworn law enforcement professional, I always bring a unique perspective and skill set to my work. 

I'm passionate about technology and values-driven tech companies. 

During my early career, I'm always looking to upskill. I'm broadly interested in cloud computing, generative AI, user experience, cybersecurity, and API documentation.
