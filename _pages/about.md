I am a PhD student at Sorbonne University working with the DELYS team in LIP6/Inria in Paris. My primary area of research
is Distributed Systems. I am studying the strategies to 'Optimise Coordination in Concurrent and Geo-Distributed Systems'. In this work, the plan is to develop a pragmatic 
approach to optimise concurrency control in actual, complex applications. The aim is to develop a tool that assists developers in identifying the concurrency control and 
coordination required to achieve correctness. My latest work is in the following

**AntidoteDB**

[AntidoteDB](https://www.antidotedb.eu) is a plane scale, highly available transactional database. During my Master thesis,
I worked on designing and implementing
1. A Cache to store CRDT objects in memory.
2. A Checkpoint store to persist these objects.
3. An Indexing mechanism to facilitate faster reads in Journal based databases.
4. Strategies to truncate the Journal upon checkpointing. 

The work has been submitted as a [dissertation](http://ayushpandey8439.github.io/files/master_thesis.pdf) towards my master degree.
