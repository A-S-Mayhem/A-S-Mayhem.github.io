Hi! I am now a third-year Ph.D. student at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/), Beijing, China. My supervisor is Prof. Wenji Mao. My major research interests are 1) Natural Language Processing, 2) Social Computing and Social Media Analytics. Prior to CASIA, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in 2016.
