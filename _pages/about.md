Hi there! I am currently a data scientist (ML direction) at ByteDance. I graduated from CMU's Master of information systems management program and CUHK(SZ) with a bachelor's degree, majoring in supply chain management.

During my time at CMU, I had the honor to work with [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu) on graph and Gaussian process projects.

I am actively applying for Ph.D. programs beginning in 24 Spring or Fall in US and UK.
