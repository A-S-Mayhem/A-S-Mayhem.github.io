My name is Jingwu Tang(唐静吾). I am a senior-year undergrad at Turing Class, Peking University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). During Fall 2021, I am pleased to have worked closely with [Zhe Feng](https://zfengharvard.github.io/) at Google Research. From Summer 2022, I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Steven Wu](https://zstevenwu.com/) at CMU. My research interest broadly lies in algorithmic game theory, differential privacy and machine learning. Most recently, I've been thinking about how to design better mechanisms through machine learning approaches.

# More About Me
I love many kinds of sports, including basketball, badminton, jogging (also some track events) and outdoor biking, yet I'm not good at all of them. I'm a big fan of Stephen Curry and Golden State Warriors.

I love reading, especially books about social science and history.

In my spare time, I like to engage in social service that may help someone in need. I spent two years organizing a school club that helps students of underdeveloped areas in China, and once became a volunteer teacher for 2 weeks.
