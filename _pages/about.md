My Story:

The best part about any story is it's beginning, where things are simple and more often than not, the beginning sets up the stage for the rest of the story. 
I am born and have spent the first 21 years of my life in Mumbai. It is a fast paced and very crowded city, however, stand still for a moment and you might see the most unique and breathtaking sights at every corner. It is a city that I will always hate and love simultaneously. I was born in 1999 at the end of the millenium. 

I studied at VCW Arya Vidya Mandir for 15 years and completed my 10th grade. In school I have dabbled in Music as I played the keyboard on Hindi Classical Notes till the 7th grade, I studied Sanskrit till the 8th grade, found my interest in politics and debate through MUNs, took part in Art competitions and exams, essayed the role of Gratiano in my school's redention of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. In school I developed liking for two main subjects- English and Mathematics. 

After AVM, I studied for 2 years as I finished Junior College at Pace Junior College and took Computer Science as an elective. My passion for math and logic, led me to Computer Engineering. I also studied and appeared for the JEE Main and Advanced in 2017. 

Finally as a 4th year undergraduate student at Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, I fell in love with the subject. I found an intitial interest in Theoretical Computer Science. I worked as a Web Developer for DJ Unicode and have contributed to their website. I began working on Machine Learning with Andrew Ng's course on Coursera, then took a deep dive into Deep Learning and Computer Vision and the rest is history.

Currently, I am a Master's applicant for Fall 2021. This portfolio displays few of my recent projects. I am interested in continuing my work in Deep Learning, Vision and Language. I have also been working in Interpretable AI and Explainable AI, which I plan to pursue as a major subject.
