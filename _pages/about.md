Hi! I'm Chris, a data support analyst in the [d3B center](https://d3b.center/) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. There, I'm responsible for helping users when they encounter problems with or have questions about using the [Kids First Data Resource Portal](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/) and helping to streamline the work that goes on behind the scenes to help shepherd data from scientists collecting the data onto the portal.

Outside of the office, I make beer and I woodwork.
