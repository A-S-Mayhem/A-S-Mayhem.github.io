üî¨ My interests are in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence!

üìö I'm currently working towards my Master's Degree in Software Engineering, Specializing in Data Science.

üìΩÔ∏è Outside of coding and studying, I enjoy working out, hanging out with friends, and sipping on boba while exploring new spots around the city.
