Brief Bio
======
I'm a 5th year PhD student at the University of Washington advised by Dan Suciu and Magda Balazinska. Broadly, I'm interested in the intersection of databases, compilers, and tensor programming. In my work, I hope to make high performance computing accessible to domain experts through declarative programming coupled with automatic program optimization.


Not Work
======
Outside of databases, tensors, etc., I spend a lot of time on the following!

**Running**: I just ran my first full marathon this summer (shoutout to the North Olympic Discovery Marathon for giving me a happy birthday run bib :) ). Going forward, I'm interested in and a bit intimidated by trail running.

**Gardening**: Last year, my partner and I had a plot in a local community garden, and we went full bore on a miniature farm. That community garden is going away this year, so we're slowly testing the limits of our building's property management patience w.r.t. grow bags...

**D&D/Tabletop RPGs**: I think tabletop games are a great way to keep in touch with people and a great excuse to be a bit silly. My group is about to start playing "Paleomythic: A Stone Age RPG", and I'm always excited to hear about new niche RPGs!
