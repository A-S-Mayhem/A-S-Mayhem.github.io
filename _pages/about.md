Hello! I'm a particle physicist working at [SLAC](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu) as a postdoctoral research associate, and a member of the [ATLAS experiment at CERN](https://atlas.cern). At SLAC, I'm a part of the [Kagan Group](https://makagan.github.io). I spend most of my time thinking about how to find physics beyond the Standard Model with the Higgs boson (particularly with its decays to bottom quarks), and how to improve our analyses techniques and reconstruction algorithms with Machine Learning.

I've also been a member of the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern) during my PhD at Northeastern University working under Professor Toyoko Orimoto, and briefly of the [D0 experiment at Fermilab](https://www-d0.fnal.gov) during my masters thesis at the Brazilian Center for Physics Research (CBPF) with Arthur KÃ³s Antunes Maciel.  

Here you can find summaries of my current and past [research activities](https://rteixeiradelima.github.io/research/), a list of my [publications and other public results](https://rteixeiradelima.github.io/publicresults/), and a list of my [talks and seminars](https://rteixeiradelima.github.io/talks/). 

You can also find me with my [SLAC](https://www-public.slac.stanford.edu/phonebook/dirsearch.aspx?lf=1&url=&gone=active&NAME=teixeira%20de%20lima), [Stanford](https://profiles.stanford.edu/rafael-teixeira-de-lima) and [CERN](https://phonebook.cern.ch/search?q=Rafael%20Teixeira%20de%20lima) profiles.
