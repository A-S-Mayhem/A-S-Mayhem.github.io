- Prior to joining the Alter lab, I received my Ph.D. in [School of Engineering](https://engineering.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), working with [Prof. George Em Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis), in 2021. I received my B.Eng. degree in [School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering](https://en.naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2015.
- My current research interest is on computational systems serology for infectious diseases. My broad research interests focus on biomechanical and bioinformatic modeling in diabetes and infectious diseases.
