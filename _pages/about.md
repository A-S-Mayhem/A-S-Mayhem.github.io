Hello,

I'm Rute Correia, a Communication PhD student at [ISCTE-IUL](https://iscte-iul.pt/).

My thesis explores the intersection between community radio and open source - how open source methodologies can serve as a model for the sustainable development of such structures. It is still at a very early stage.

My research (and personal) interests revolve around the [open movement](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/open-movement/), open content and copyleft, remix studies, digital rights and activism, participatory social structures, radio art and experimental forms of radio production.

Radio work
------

I am also an experienced radio person, having presented and produced various shows and features, as well as managed music and communication departments at different stations. I currently host and produce the morning show at [Oxig√©nio 102.6](http://oxigenio.fm/).

For nearly a decade, I have been hosting and producing [White Market Podcast](https://www.whitemarketpodcast.eu/), an advocate podcast about free music and free culture.
