Welcome to my personal site!

I received a degree in Computer Science Engineering from the TarapacÃ¡ University, where I graduated with a score of 6.0
My final project consisted of a comparative study of classification techniques using data from female students choosing computer science/information technology careers in universities affiliated with the Council of Rectors of Universities in Chile (CRUCH) in the northern region of Chile. The aim was to identify relevant variables influencing the choice of such careers.

During my undergraduate degree, I made different teaching assistant and presented a paper at a conference. After graduated, I continued to teach at the university and discovered that I could not give up teaching and research. 

Actually Iâ€™m lecturing in TarapacÃ¡ University and Iâ€™m interested in pursuing postgraduate studies, specifically a Master's program focusing on research areas in Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 


ðŸ”¬ Interests :

  * Computer Vision
  * Pattern Recognition
  * Reinforcement Learning
