I'm a machine learning researcher at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. Feel free to contact me, we are always looking for new researchers and engineers.

My research interests lie in probabilistic approaches to machine learning. I'm currently working on, among others, variational implementations of an infinite stochastic block model, neural network matrix factorization, and autoencoders. I'm also working on NLP applications in word and sentence embeddings and text classification.

During my MPhil I was working with Genta Indra Winata on a virtual therapist self-help platform. We were using machine learning to detect, among others, stress and personality of users. This project was supervised by Pascale Fung.

Before that, I completed my Bachelors in Applied Physics, with particular interest in computational and statistical physics, and everything quantum.

About this website
------
This site is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
