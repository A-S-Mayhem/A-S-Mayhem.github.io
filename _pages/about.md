Hi there! I am currently a data scientist (ML direction) at ByteDance. I graduated from CMU master of information systems management program and CUHK(SZ) with a becholar degree majoring in supply chain management.

During my time at CMU, I had the honor to work with [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu) on projects in graph and Gaussian process. I also worked an table QA project with Daniel Fried, turned from a NLP course project.

I am actively applying for Ph.D. programs beggining in 24 Spring or Fall in US and UK.
