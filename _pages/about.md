I'm a second year undergraduate student studying **Data Science and Economics** from the [School of Statistics](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn) and the [School of Applied Economics](http://ae.ruc.edu.cn/home/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn). I also had an amazing experience in Spring 2024 as an exchange student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu). I'm fortunate to join the Strutured Data Science Lab and work under [Prof. Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io).
