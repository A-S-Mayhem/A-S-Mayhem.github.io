I am a first year PhD student at the University of Oxford, kindly supported by the Clarendon Scholarship and the Kennedy Trust Prize Studentship. I am working on developing machine learning tools to better understand biological systems. Specifically, my research focuses on cell fate decisions and tissue dynamics. Previously, I completed MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing also at Oxford and BSc in Theoretical Physics at University College London. I grew up in Georgia and moved to the UK at the start of my undergraduate degree.

Research Interests
======
My interests lie at the intersection of applied mathematics, machine learning and systems biology. I like working with data to develop interpretable tools and uncover hidden patterns. So far my focus has been on Geometric Deep Learning.
