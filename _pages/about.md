Hello! I’m Zhihupan, a doctoral researcher in the Doctoral Programme of Social and Behavioural Sciences at the University of Turku, Finland, supervised by Prof. Jukka Leppänen (https://www.utu.fi/en/people/jukka-leppanen) and Dr. Chaoxiong Ye (https://www.utu.fi/en/people/chaoxiong-ye).

My research focuses on visual working memory (VWM), exploring its cognitive mechanisms, neural correlates, and individual differences using behavioral experiments, neuroimaging (e.g., EEG). I’m particularly interested in how VWM capacity and precision interact with attention, learning, and real-world decision-making.

I hold a Bachelor’s in Applied Psychology from Southwest Medical University (China) and a Master’s in Psychology from Sichuan Normal University (China), where I developed a strong foundation in experimental design and statistical analysis. Passionate about open science, I aim to make my work reproducible and accessible.
