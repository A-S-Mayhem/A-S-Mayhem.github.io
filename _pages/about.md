Welcome! I am a 2nd-year master student of Artificial Intelligence at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en). I'm advised by Prof. [Ruihua Song](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/addons/teacher/index/info.html?user_id=0&ruccode=ATNUbVJhBjJRNgY3UDQFMg%3D%3D&ln=en), working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Multi-modal Dialogue. Prior to that, I completed my B.S. from School of Computer Science and Technology, [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/).

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Multi-modal Understanding, for the purpose of giving machines the ability to perceive, understand, and express like humans.

Recently,  I have been dedicated to enabling Large Language Models (LLM) to process multi-modal information and endowing them with the ability to perceive the world.


## News
08/2023    Our paper "TikTalk" on multi-modal dialogue is accepted by ACM MM 2023!
