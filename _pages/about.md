Hi! I'm currently a Software Engineering postgraduate student in [National University of Defense Technology](https://english.nudt.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Huai-Min Wang, and co-supervised by Da-wei Feng.

**Research Interests**

The application of LLM is a trend that cannot be ignored, and how to maximize the potential of LLM is an important issue. We hope that we can continue to improve the technology of large models so that they can continue to contribute to human development in the future.

* Data Engineering
* Continuous learning
* Model Evaluation
* Model Security
* Model Serving

I'm open for academic collaborations. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.
