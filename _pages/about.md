I'm a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Data Science and Technology and Computer Science in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). My research interest includes LLMs, human AI collaborations, human computer interaction and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to work with [Prof. Raymond Chi-Wing Wong](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/) and [Prof. Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/)  from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), HKUST.
