I am a second year computer science PhD student at GESIS, Leibnitz Institute for the Social Sciences, studying how errors and biases in the use of digital traces for social research with Prof. Claudia Wagner and the Computational Social SCience (CSS) Department. Through natural language processing, and measurement theory, my research focuses on how researchers and policy makers can draw better and more transparent insights from data.
