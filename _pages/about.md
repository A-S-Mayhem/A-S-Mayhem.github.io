I am an Economist Bachellor interested in different academic fields such as economic development, income and education inequality, innovation and technology. I like reading about the impact of new advanced technologies in daily life and society. In that sence i am looking forward to enrich my programing skills in Machine Learning and policy evaluation tools.

Selected Experience
======
I am starting an specialization on setember 2023 on Data Science for Social Science and Public Managment at PUCP. In the future i will post some of my work in my Github repository.

On 2022-1 i enrolled on the Machine Learning and Causal Inference course at PUCP. I learned the theory and practical tools to estimate causality. Such methods include: lasso regressions, causal trees and causal forest. You can see the materials of the course [here](https://github.com/AlvaroZapata27/Machine-Learning-and-Causal-Inference-PUCP). I had the opportunity to learn and use 3 different coding languages: Python, R and Julia. 

In most of my univesity projects and work experiences I have worked using Stata. Some of the more relevant databases that i have worked with are the Encuesta Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO), Encuesta Económica Anual (EEA), Encuesta Nacional de Innovación (ENIIM) and Sistema de Información para la toma de Decisiones (SIRTOD).
