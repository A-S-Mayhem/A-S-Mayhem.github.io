## About Me

I am currently an Associate Technical Writer based in Scottsdale, Arizona at [Paradox](https://www.paradox.ai/), a company dedicated to reimagining the future of hiring.

I have a diverse background in technical writing for SaaS companies that serve different verticals—such as legal, financial, healthcare, and retail—and experience working as a digital forensics investigator for a government organization.

I'm passionate about technology and values-driven companies. During my early career, I'm always looking to upskill. I'm broadly interested in cloud computing, generative AI, UX, and API documentation.

Feel free to take a look at my [resumé](https://katherine-holtz.github.io/cv/), view my [writing portfolio](https://katherine-holtz.github.io/portfolio/), or send me a message through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-holtz/) or [email](mailto:katherineaholtz@gmail.com).
