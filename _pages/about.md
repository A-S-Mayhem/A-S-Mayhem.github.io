I am a PhD candidate at King's College London, working with Gabriele Sicuro and Pierpaolo Vivo, and collaborating with researchers based at École Normale Supérieure, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, the Flatiron institute and TU Munich.

Previously, I have obtained a MSc in Applied Maths from Imperial College London with a thesis on agent-based modelling of opinion formation and a BA (Hons) in Mathematics and Philosophy from King's College London with a strong focus on applied maths, logic and philosophy of language.

<strong>Research interests:</strong>
- Applications of statistical physics to machine learning
- Statistical inference in high dimensions
- Agent-based modelling
