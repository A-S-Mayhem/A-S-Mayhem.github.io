I am a [Professor of Statistics](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/christopher-nemeth) in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Lancaster University.

I am interested in problems pertaining to Bayesian machine learning and computational statistics, with a focus on Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo techniques. My current research is focused on Bayesian methods for large-scale datasets and tools for online learning. I have also worked on problems related to Gaussian processes and network modelling.

I currently hold a UKRI-EPSRC Turing AI Fellowship on [*Probabilistic Algorithms for Scalable and Computable Approaches to Learning (PASCAL)*](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FV022636%2F1) and formerly an EPSRC Innovation Fellowship on [*Scalable and Exact Data Science for Security and Location-based Data*](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FS00159X%2F1). I am also a Co-I on the EPSRC-funded [*Data Science for the Natural Environment*](http://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FR01860X%2F1) and the NERC-funded [*Signals in the Soil*](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FT012307%2F1) project.

I am the Chair of the Royal Statistical Society Section on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning [*RSS-CSML*](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/statistical-computing/) and also a member of the [EPSRC Mathematical Sciences Early Career Forum](https://epsrc.ukri.org/research/ourportfolio/themes/mathematics/strategy/earlycareerforum/). I am currently an Associate Editor for the journal [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-centric-engineering).
