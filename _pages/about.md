My research is focused on the wave propagation in the classical system, i.e., the solid mechanics, acoustics, and optics. The relative expertises include the band theory in phononic/photonic crystals, the optimization of metamaterials, and the design of topological materials. My current works are about the catalogue of topological phononic/photonic materials and the machine learning enhanced physics. The successes include the optimal design of the quantum spin/valley Hall topological insulators, the crystalline topological insulators, the 3D helical multipole topological insulators, and the machine learning models of the quantum spin/valley Hall topological insulators and the higher-order topological insulators.
