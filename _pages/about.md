Before I stumbled into technical writing, I worked as a Digital Forensics Investigator at an organization called the Cyber Crimes Unit under the St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office. I acquired, parsed, and analyzed digital evidence from devices involved in active criminal cases—such as mobile phones or computers—and wrote forensic reports about my findings for detectives, prosecutors, and defense attorneys alike. It was a fascinating job to hold as somebody who was an undergraduate student, and sometimes, I felt like I was in an episode of *Law & Order*.

I've always loved reading and writing, so naturally, I studied English. In university, I read about dynamic worlds and textual lives, from Austen to Wilde to Baldwin. To this day, I find it hard to articulate why exactly I love reading and writing so much. If I had to give a definitive answer, I would say that it's because it allows me to learn about something that's outside of me, beyond my own perspective. 

If that's my definitive answer to why I love reading and writing so much, it makes sense that I found an affinity with technology. In the tech industry, there are always new trends emerging, which can feel overwhelming. Mass layoffs during a bust cycle add to the uncertainty. Despite these things, I see myself working in the tech industry for a while—as long it allows me to continue learning and growing. 

So, why technical writing?
1. I love the idea of breaking down complex topics or products and making it easy for others to understand, whether that’s through words, images, or other formats. There’s something exciting about making complicated information simple, so there's never a barrier to accessing information. 
2. I enjoy the challenge of organizing information and designing content. It feels like solving a puzzle, and I love figuring out how to set up knowledge bases so that they work well for everyone, whether inside or outside of a company.
3. I enjoy learning new things and also helping others learn new things. As a technical writer, you get to do both—by knowing your audience and collaborating with subject matter experts (SMEs).

## My Interests
Outside of work, I love to travel. I studied abroad at Trinity College Dublin in Dublin, Ireland in the spring of 2023, where I went all over Ireland and Europe (my top three cities were Prague, Amsterdam, and Edinburgh). My current travel bucket list includes the national parks, British Columbia, Iceland, and South Korea. I've been scrapbooking my travel adventures, which is the reason why I hoard every single train or plane ticket I acquire.

I've also played indoor and beach volleyball for 14 years, and although I don't play competitively anymore, I try to join every casual league or intramural team I come across. Aside from volleyball, I love to run. I ran my first half marathon during my last semester of university, and I hope to run my first marathon next year. I'm holding out hope that I'll be Boston-bound someday. 

Lastly, I've always been a creative writer. I wrote stories on the school bus in sixth grade, and although fiction writing is something I've lost touch with during university, I know I'll be disappointing my younger self if I never try to publish my own novel. My favorite genres, a reflection of my time working at the Cyber Crimes Unit, are in the mystery and thriller realm.
