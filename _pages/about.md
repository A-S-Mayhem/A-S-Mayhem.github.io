Welcome, everyone! I am Sergi Mart√≠nez, a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Social and Political Sciences of the European University Institute under the supervision of professor Elias Dinas, and prof. Miriam Golden is my second co-supervisor. 

My research interest lies in the long-term imprint of political violence and conflict on political behavior and identities. This includes civil wars and international conflict, but also authoritarian repression and policies. You may find more detail at the Research section of this webpage and in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=en&user=V5c0kqoAAAAJ). 

Thanks for your visit!
