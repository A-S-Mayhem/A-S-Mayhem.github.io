Hello! I am Rodrigo Grijalba, Bachelor in Economics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) and student of Data Science in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory for Social Science Research in the same university.

I have a deep interest in the theory and application of quantitative methods as well as the development of tools that facilitate these methods. These quantitative methods include RCTs as well as quasi-experimental study designs, Machine Learning, and applied econometrics. I am experienced in applying these methods through R and Python programming languages.

My hobbies include music theory and playing, as well as coffee making.
