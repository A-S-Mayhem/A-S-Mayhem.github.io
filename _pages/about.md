I am a Bolivian evolutionary ecologist interested in Macroecology and Macroevolution, Community and Theoretical Ecology, Landscape Ecology and Natural History. I am currently a Research Scientist at the Department of Ecology, Evolution & Behavior,  University of Minnesota. I am also an official and founder member of the Association for the advancement of the sciences of Santa Cruz and the Scientific research council of Santa Cruz for the Bolivian Academy of Sciences (_Scientia Crucencis_).

I am particularly interested in understanding geographical patterns of biodiversity and the structure of ecological communities, and the underlying processes that drive, maintain and alter such patterns. My work concentrates on terrestrial systems, with a focus on avifauna, vascular plants but also encompassing other terrestrial groups. I integrate evolutionary and ecological theories of biodiversity and develop methodological advances to unveil processes acting in concert at different temporal and spatial scales. __The ultimate aim of my research program is to apply insights gained from understanding the onset of biodiversity patterns to inform conservation and management responses to ongoing global change and biodiversity loss__.
