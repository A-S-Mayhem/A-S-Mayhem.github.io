Hello! I'm Zhichuan MA, a second-year graduate student at the prestigious [Ecole Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.polytechnique.edu/). My academic journey began at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), one of China's renowned institutions. Here, I was honored to be a part of the [Chu Kochen Honors College](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E6%B5%99%E6%B1%9F%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E7%AB%BA%E5%8F%AF%E6%A1%A2%E5%AD%A6%E9%99%A2) following my achievements in the 2019 national college entrance examinations.

Over the past four years, my academic pursuits have revolved around energy engineering and its interdisciplinary connections. My experiences at both [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) and [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) have not only provided me with a deep understanding of energy engineering but have also endowed me with robust foundational knowledge in mathematics and physics. Coupled with this, I've honed advanced computer skills that have further amplified my academic capabilities.
