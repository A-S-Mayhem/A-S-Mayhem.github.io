I'm a 4th year PhD student in Mathematics at the chair of Mathematical Statistics at TUM. I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Mathias Drton](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/drton-mathias) and [Tobias Windisch](https://tobias-windisch.de/).

My research revolves around graphical models and their use in high-dimensional statistics, in causal learning and causal structure learning, and their intersection.

Since October 2022 I receive funding from Robert Bosch GmbH.
