# Brief Bio
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/) at McGill University, where I work with [Prof. Jackie C.K. Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/). I got my Ph.D. from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, at the eXascale Infolab group under the supervision of [Prof. Philippe Cudré-Mauroux](https://exascale.info/phil/). During my Ph.D., I did an internship of four months at Alexa Shopping, [Amazon Research](https://www.amazon.science/), based in Seattle. I also hold an engineering degree from SUP’COM (Tunisia). During my university career, I was part of an exchange student program in 2016 at the University of Padova in Italy. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Crowdsourcing, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. I aim to develop human-AI models that are trustworthy, controllable, and effective.
