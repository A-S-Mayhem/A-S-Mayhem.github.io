Welcome to Craig Toth's Personal Portfolio.

My experience as a teaching professional began when I developed the Polk County (Florida) School Board website. Following this, I served as aÂ  technology teacher and network manager. My responsibilities in these positions included overseeing a large, high school network, training teachers and staff, and developing a technology plan and budget. I pioneered a series of "firsts," including:

All teachers with access to the school network and Internet.
State-of-the-art electronic gradebook system used by teachers.
Technology User Groups (TUGs), made up of representatives from each academic department, to help train and support teachers.
Student Technology Assistants providing technology support to students, faculty, and staff for academic credit.

I currently serve as pastor of New Mount Vernon United Methodist Church in Winston Salem, NC, where I teach church members scriptural precepts using historic examples and contemporary resources. I have served as a pastor in the Western North Carolina Conference since I graduated from Duke Divinity School in 2008.
