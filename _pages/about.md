I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. I completed my undergraduate from Tribhuvan University, Nepal. My research interests includes GPU accelerated high performance computing, machine learning, big data, algorithms and graph analytics. My PhD advisor is Professor Hang Liu. 
You can see my publications in the `publication` tab or from google scholar.

The theme of my research is **system for machine learning and machine learning for system**.  

I enjoy hiking, playing basketball and football during my free time.
