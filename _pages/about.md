Hello!

I am a 4th year PhD student in the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine program. Using computational and statistical approaches, I am researching the genetic basis of human disease within the labs of Olivier Elemento and Andrew Clark at Cornell's NYC and Ithaca campuses.

Previously, I received my B.S. from Cornell University in Biometry & Statistics, with a minor in Biological Sciences and a concentration in Statistical Genomics. During undergraduate, I worked in the lab of Philipp Messer on a Bayesian coalescent framework for inferring selective sweeps in population genetic data and with Pat Sullivan on modeling fish population dynamics in time-series data. For two summers, I was a statistical genetics intern at the Regeneron Genetics Center in Tarrytown, NY, where I evaluated statistical methodologies for genome-wide association studies.

My long-term interests are to use genetic, environmental, pharmacological variation for (1) therapeutic target discovery, by discovering new genetic associations and dissecting their underlying mechanisms; (2) precision medicine, by personalizing treatment regimens based on molecular alterations, (3) interventive and preventive care, by identifying high-risk individuals for preventive strategies.
