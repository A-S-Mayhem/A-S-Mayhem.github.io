I am a Ph.D. candidate in philosophy in University of Western Ontario. My main interest concerns the nature of semantic knowledge that humans use to understand languages. I was initially trained as a philosopher of language and worked in formal semantics, but I have more recently started working in the field of psycholinguistics and computational linguistics. As a result, I try to connect these different fields by using behavioral experiments and computational modeling, deep neural networks, and statistical modeling, to verify different semantic theories of lexical meaning, compositional meaning, and pragmatics. My long term goal is to utilize my interdisciplinary background to understand scientifically the nature of language and cognition with the help of contemporary philosophical theorizing, and promote interdisciplinary cooperation between different fields of studies on language.
