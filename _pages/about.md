Welcome to my page! 

<p align="justify">
I am a Ph.D. student at the [Deparment of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/), Washington University in St. Louis [(WashU)](https://wustl.edu/). I am the manager of the Political Data Science Lab and a graduate researcher at the Data-driven Analysis Peace Project [(DAPP)](https://dapp-lab.org/) lab at WashU. 

I study political communication, political behaviors, and public opinion with a regional focus on China. Specifically, my current research focuses on elite discourses on external threats and examines whether and how they shape political attitudes and behaviors. Another set of my research focuses on how the development of state capacity affects public opinion. I also apply and advance methods in text analysis. 

I enrolled in a Double Degree Program initiated and fully funded by the Bai Xian Asia Insitute [(BXAI)](https://www.bxai.org/), where I received my Bachelor of Science in Global China Studies [(GCS)](https://www.shss.ust.hk/ug/major/gcs/) from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [(HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and [Bachelor of Art in Economics](https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/pse/en/) from [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/) in 2020.
