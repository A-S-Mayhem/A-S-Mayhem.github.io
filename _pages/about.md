Welcome to my personal space on the web! 

I am currently a PhD student at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), Belgium. My research topic is centered around asteroseismology, the study of waves inside (variable) stars to characterize how stars evolve, by improving current theoretical models. I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Chemistry ('Chemie') from the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) and my M.Sc. in Astronomy & Astrophysics from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).

My work has been [published](https://jvb11.github.io/publications) in *Astronomy & Astrophysics*. My [research](https://jvb11.github.io/research) is primarily focused on the nonlinear interactions between (gravity) waves propagating inside stars. In addition to this topic, some of my papers discussed the influence of magnetic fields on gravity waves inside stars.<sup id="a1">[1](#fn1)</sup> I also maintain an active interest in (astro)chemistry and plasma physics and try to keep up with some of the recent advances within these field. 

I have [teaching](https://jvb11.github.io/teaching) experience in (generic) freshman university-level physics courses, and have been a tutor in chemistry / physics / mathematics at the secundary education level. I furthermore co-authored a Python exercise at the freshman (university) level that teaches students how to visualize physics on their screens.

<sub><a name="fn1">1</a>: Note the difference between a gravity wave and a gravitational wave. Whereas the latter event ripples the space-time continuum and is created by highly energetic events such as the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the former event is much less energetic and therefore can be found in less energy-dense environments, such as the interior of a star (:slightly_smiling_face:). Gravity waves can also be found closer to our homes, in the form of waves propagating in the deep oceans of our mother Earth, and are driven by buoyancy. [â†©](#a1)</sub>
