Hey, 

My name is Jonas and I am currently working to obtain my PhD in Interpretable AI from Leibniz University in Hannover, Germany. My research focuses on Interpretability in cases where AI is directly applied-to/used-by humans. Currently, my interests mainly focus on: 
* Probing deep learning models
* Interpretability for search
* Interpretability and bias in news recommendation
* Personalized medicine

If you are want to discuss these topics, feel free to send me an email!
