I am a Ph.D. student in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. My research fields are labor economics and data science, and my interests include discrimination, criminal justice, algorithmic bias, and incorporating machine learning methodology into more traditional econometric analysis. Previously, I was a predoctoral fellow at the Industrial Relations Section, where I worked on analyzing discrimination in the criminal justice system, how the opioid crisis impacted labor market outcomes, and growing inequality in the labor market, in particular in the music industry. I am a graduate of Wellesley College, where I studied economics and math.
