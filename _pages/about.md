I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Mila Quebec](https://mila.quebec/en/person/hafez-ghaemi/) and [University of Montreal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/) advised by [Eilif Muller](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=r4-NZhwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Shahab Bakhtiari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f_JDOhEAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include self-supervised learning, deep learning, theoretical neuroscience, and reinforcement learning.


Previously, I completed my second M.Sc. in Computer Engineering, AI and Robotics at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) (advised by [Hamed Kebriaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDseLNYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Majid Nili](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QlwWxmoAAAAJ&hl=en)). I hold another M.Sc. in Data Science and Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en) (advised by [Fabio Fagnani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oqwlDQEAAAAJ) and [Giacomo Como](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7dju3QoAAAAJ&hl=en)). I completed my B.Sc. in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer engineering at University of Tehran (advised by [Masoud Shariat Panahi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UwlyBw0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)).
