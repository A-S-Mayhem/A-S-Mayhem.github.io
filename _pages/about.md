<p class="lead"> I am an Assistant Professor at <b>Universidad de O'Higgins</b> in Chile.</p>

<p class="lead"> Before joining Universidad de O'Higgins, I served one year as a post-doctoral fellow at <b>Tulane University</b> for the 2017-2018 AY. I received my Ph.D in Political Science from <b>Rutgers University</b> (New Brunswick, NJ) in the spring of 2017.</p>

<p class="lead"> My research is either forthcoming, or has been published in <b>Acta Politica</b>, <b>Journal of Politics in Latin America</b>, <b>Regional Science, Policy and Practice</b> and <b>Revista de Ciencia Politica</b>. I am also an Associate Editor of Social Science (Springer).</p>

<p class="lead"> [Download my CV here](http://github.com/hbahamonde/Job_Market/raw/master/Bahamonde_CV.pdf)</p>

My <b>primary subfield is the political economy of development of Latin America</b>. My <b>research</b> extends across several substantive areas, including state capacity, clientelism and political development. As an applied methodologist I also have a strong interest in <b>statistical and experimental methods</b>.

Dissertation
============

My dissertation argues that sectoral economic conflicts fostered state-building in Latin America. Using fine-grained historical case study comparisons, sectoral outputs from 1900 to the present, panel data and time-series econometric techniques, and a novel earthquake dataset (to measure state capacities), I find that industrial expansion altered the post-colonial political balance, putting heavy pressures for the implementation of tax institutions. In turn, fiscal expansion fostered both political development and economic growth. In my <b>book project</b> I expand these findings.
