<br>

My name is Yongming Luo (骆泳铭). I am a mathematician specializing in mathematical analysis. 

I obtained my Bachelor and Master degrees in Mathematics from the Technische Universität München. I completed my Ph.D. thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://www.mathematik.uni-kassel.de/~dknees/">Prof. Dr. Dorothee Knees</a> at the Universität Kassel. After that, I worked as a PostDoc with <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/wir/neukamm/die-professur/inhaber-in">Prof. Dr. Stefan Neukamm</a> at the Technische Universität Dresden.

Since March 2023, I become a Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics of the Shenzhen MSU-BIT University in China.
