# About me

Thank you for visiting my website.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona working on **English, Spanish, and Portuguese** research.

My **language annotation, analysis, and language engineering** experience with traditional and computational methods has led me to work in group and individual projects in **academia and industry**.

My research interests lay in the intersection between communication outcomes, theoretical linguistics, and big data.

### Backend Software Development, Data Curation, and Outreach

I am currently working as a Graduate Assistant for the University of Arizona Libraries under the supervision of [Dr. Chun Ly](https://astrochun.github.io/) in DevOps, data curation, and outreach for the University of Arizona Libraries' [Research Data Repository (ReDATA)](https://data.library.arizona.edu/redata).

### Dissertation work

My dissertation work is on cutting-edge analysis of teacher-student interactions. Specifically,

- The collection of a teacher-student email interaction corpus which includes sociolinguistic, language experience, email experience, and course information about the participants.
- Qualitative and quantitative analysis of such interactions using corpus pragmatics, rapport-management theory, speech act theory,  politeness theory, and variational pragmatics.
- Computational linguistics analysis (principal component analysis, machine learning, deep learning).

**My dissertation committee includes:**
- [Dr. Carmen King de Ramirez](https://carmenkingramirez.com/) (Director)
- [Dr. Julieta Fernandez](https://julietafernandez.faculty.arizona.edu/) (Spanish and Portuguese, SLAT)
- [Dr. Sandiway Fong](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~sandiway/) (Linguistics, Computer Science)
- [Dr. Helena Gomez Adorno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-gomez-adorno-31930524/?originalSubdomain=mx) (IIMAS - UNAM)

### My working philisophy

```python
def jump_higher():
    do = 'improv'
    now = 'e'
    recursively = 'ing
    print (f"{do + now} and keep {do + recursively}")

while True:
    jump_higher()
```
