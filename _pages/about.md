I am a PhD student in Natural Language Pocessing at the NLP lab of Bar Ilan University, supervised by Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty.
Previously I did a research internship at Google, obtained an MSc from the University of Edinburgh and a BA from the University of Zurich.

My research focuses on *discourse* phenomena and *pragmatics*. Often I use QA representations to capture propositions and once in a while I look at the modality of events.

I am co-organizing [the Second Workshop on Understanding Implicit and Underspecified Language](https://unimplicit2022.github.io/), collocated with NAACL-2022 in Seattle.

Besides this I love going to the "cinemathèque" and on hikes with my friends. My Erdős number is 3.
