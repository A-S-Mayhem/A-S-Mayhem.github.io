I was born in Mexico City and studied my college and master's there.
I got a bachelor's degree in Experimental Psychology, 
studied a Specialization in Applied Statistics, 
and got my master's degree in Economics.
Currently, I am at UCSB in the PhD program in economics 
with my interest in Experimental Economics, and Belief Updating.
