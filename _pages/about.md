I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Citrine Informatics](http://www.citrine.io), where we are building the world's largest materials informatics data platform backed by AI for materials discovery and optimization. My primary interests include machine learning, data viz, and the intersection of data-driven techniques with physical sciences.

I have a PhD in Physics from UC Santa Cruz, where my research involved semiconductor nanomaterials for next-generation energy conversion.
