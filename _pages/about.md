I am currently a graduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. I am interested in neurally plausible models of data representation and learning. I am advised by Sanjoy Dasgupta and Tajana Rosing.

I received my Bachelor of Science, with high honors, in Agricultural Economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2013 and previously worked as a Senior Research Analyst at Brown University for Justine Hastings and Jesse Shapiro.
