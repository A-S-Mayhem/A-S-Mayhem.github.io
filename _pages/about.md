Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography, co-advised by [Caroline Ummenhofer](https://ummenhofer.whoi.edu/) and [Delia Oppo](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/doppo/). I am interested in tropical climate dynamics and variability on decadal to centennial timescales. 

My doctoral thesis is focused on climate variability in the Indo-Pacific region, focusing specifically on the atmospheric and oceanic pathways along with the associated hydroclimate impacts in the region. To tackle these questions, I utilize climate models of varying complexity, observations, as well as paleoclimate archives. Outside of research, I enjoy tennis, rock climbing, and skiing in the winter.
