I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [Bordeaux School of Economics](https://www.bse.u-bordeaux.fr). I was a Fulbright visiting student at [UC - Berkeley](https://are.berkeley.edu) in 2022-2023 and the [University of Georgia](https://agecon.uga.edu) in 2021.

My research focus on understanding the constraints preventing quality-upgrading in local agricultural value-chain in sub-Sahara Africa context. I work on topics related to technology adoption, crops quality, and social protection.
