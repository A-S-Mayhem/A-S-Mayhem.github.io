Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography, co-advised by [Caroline Ummenhofer](https://ummenhofer.whoi.edu/) and [Delia Oppo](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/doppo/). I am interested in tropical climate dynamics and variability on various timescales. 

My doctoral thesis is aimed at understanding variability in the Indo-Pacific, focusing on atmospheric and oceanic circulation along with regional hydroclimate. In my research, I utilize climate models, observations, and paleoclimate archives to understand past and present climate conditions to better inform future climate projections. Outside of research, I enjoy playing tennis, skiing in the winter, and rock climbing.
