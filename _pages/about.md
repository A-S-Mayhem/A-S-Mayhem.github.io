Hello! I'm __Nandan Thakur (नंदन ठाकुर / নন্দন ঠাকুর)__ [\[CV\]](). 

I'm second-year PhD student working on "Data-Efficient and Multilingual Information Retrieval" at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in Canada. 
I am supervised by [Prof. Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/). 
I recently completed a 6 month internship at Google Research in Mountain View, California in Winter 2022. 

Prior to joining my PhD, I was as a research assistant (RA) at the [UKP Lab, Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) in Germany working with [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp) and [Dr. Nils Reimers](https://www.nils-reimers.de/). 
I completed my bachelor's in Electronics and Instrumentation and a minor in Finance from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani)](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2018. 
Besides these experiences, I have over a year of industrial experience in Machine Learning, working as a Data Scientist in [KNOLSKAPE](https://knolskape.com/) and interning during my bachelors in the [Gibson Lab](https://www.embl.org/groups/gibson/) in EMBL Heidelberg and [Belong.co](https://belong.co/). 


## :mag: Research Interests
My research interests lie within NLP and Information Retrieval. I like to study and work on building easy, scalable and efficient systems in the neural search paradigm. My long-term research ambition lies in building robust and generalizable retrieval models to help serve information better for everyone. Few of my notable works include developing the BEIR Benchmark [(Thakur et al., NeurIPS 2021)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wCu6T5xFjeJ) and Augmented SBERT [(Thakur et al., NAACL 2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.28/). 

### Data Efficiency: Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation


### Languages: Multilingual Retrieval



## Community Contribution

I have an interesting background story, where I pivoted into academic lifesyle of doing research to pursure my interests in open-source research in NLP and IR.
Changing domains can be daunting, however, my academic mentors and peers' guidance have been influential at an early stage in my career to help overcome the challenge.

I wish to continue the tradition, I am willing to mentor a few early stage undergraduate / master students interested towards my direction. Personally, I encourage students with diverse backgrounds to reach out.
