Hi! I am a Computer Vision and Robotics software engineer, currently working on perception algorithms for autonomous vehicles at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/). I envision a world where computers can reason about the 3D environment from visual data, much like humans. I am passionate about geometry, optimization, and machine learning, and enjoy working on problems at their intersection. 

<!-- Background
====== -->
I earned my Master's degree focusing on Machine Learning and Robotics from [Georgia Institute of Technology](gatech.edu) in the otherwise awful year of 2020. As a student researcher working on SLAM and SfM with [Prof. Frank Dellaert](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/FrankDellaert/Frank_Dellaert/Frank_Dellaert.html), I contributed to the [GTSAM library](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam). I also had the wonderful experience of working with the [RAIL lab](http://rail.gatech.edu/) and winning the [FetchIt! challenge](https://ic.gatech.edu/news/622859/georgia-tech-team-wins-new-fetch-robot-icras-fetchit-mobile-manipulation-challenge) at ICRA 2019. I spent the summer of 2019 as a Computer Vision Intern at [Blue River Technology](https://bluerivertechnology.com/), which also taught me a little about agriculture.

Even before that, I was an undergrad at Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering in the beautiful city of Mysuru, which is also where I grew up. As an undergrad I was an IEEE volunteer and spent my time working on robotics challenges, which ultimately drew me closer to the field.
