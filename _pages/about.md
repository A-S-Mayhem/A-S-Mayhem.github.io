I’m majoring in statistics and computer science and is passionate about topics such as machine learning and software development. Solving problems using programming and analyzing tools are things that I enjoy the most! I improved my programming skills through my previous experience in the technology industry and I’m eager to adopt new skills. I’m a quick learner, team contributor, and a good sport player.

This is my personal website that documents my experience and work.
