I'm a 3rd-year PhD candidate in [biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at Harvard University. [My research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iZnTmxMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) focuses on developing new statistical methods to leverage sub-optimal real world data to improve decision-making in public health and clinical medicine. My interests lie in precision medicine, surrogate markers, semi-supervised inference, distributed learning, causal inference, and clinical trial design. I'm lucky to be mentored by [Professor Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/).

I enjoy spending time on the golf course, catching up on the latest in US-China relations, and cheering on the Tar Heels!
