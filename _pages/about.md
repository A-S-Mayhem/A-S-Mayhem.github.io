I am a second-year PhD student doing neuroscience research at the California Institute of Technology ([Caltech](https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/)). My advisor is Prof. [Markus Meister](https://meisterlab.caltech.edu/markusmeister). I am interested in cognitive flexibility, learning and memory in mice and humans. 

Prior to Caltech, I did my undergraduate studies at Cornell University (B.S. in Biological Engineering) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (B.Eng. in Food Science and Engineering). I then obtained a Master's degree in Education and Psychology at the University of Cambridge.
