Welcome to my page! 

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Deparment of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/), Washington University in St. Louis [(WashU)](https://wustl.edu/). I am the manager of the Political Data Science Lab at WashU and a graduate researcher at the Data-driven Analysis Peace Project [(DAPP)](https://dapp-lab.org/) lab. I am interested in authoritarian politics with a regional focus on China, public opinion, territorial disputes, as well as text analysis. 

I enrolled in a Double Degree Program initiated and fully funded by the Bai Xian Asia Insitute [BXAI](https://www.bxai.org/), where I received my Bachelor of Science in Global China Studies [GCS](https://www.shss.ust.hk/ug/major/gcs/) from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [(HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and [Bachelor of Art in Economics](https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/pse/en/) from [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/) in 2020.
