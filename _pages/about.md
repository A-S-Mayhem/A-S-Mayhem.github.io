Hello! I am a [SENSE](https://eo-cdt.org/) PhD student based in the [School of Geosciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences) at the University of Edinburgh. My project aims to utilise remote sensing to improve our understanding of the various atmospheric and oceanic forcings affecting the dynamics of Greenland's marine terminating glaciers.

I am supervised by Professor Peter Nienow, Professor Anna Hogg, Dr Encarni Medina-Lopez, Dr Andrew Sole and Dr Benjamin Davidson. My PhD is part of the NERC and UK Space Agency funded Centre for Doctoral Training "[SENSE](https://eo-cdt.org/)": the Centre for Satellite Data in Environmental Science.
