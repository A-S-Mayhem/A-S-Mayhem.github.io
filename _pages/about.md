I am currently a first year Electrical Engineering Doctorate Student at NYU Tandon. I recieved my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Santa Clara University in June 2022. My research interests focus on the intersection between Electromagnetics and Wireless Communications. Current topics that I am exploring include the use of feedback gain to the receive channel of antenna systems, and the use of Wideband FM techniques for 5G/6G applications. Previously, I have researched topics such as Direct Antenna Modulation, and the use of Software Defined Radios for Hydrogen Line Radio Astronomy.
