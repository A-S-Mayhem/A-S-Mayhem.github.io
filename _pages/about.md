I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Cognitive Sciences](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/) at the University of California Irvine and a member of the [Spatial Neuroscience Lab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/lab-members/). My advisor is [Prof. Elizabeth R. Chrastil](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/) and my research focuses on human navigation and spatial cognition.
