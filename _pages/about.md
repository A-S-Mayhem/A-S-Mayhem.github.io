Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, Felipe studied Neuroscience and Economics at the University of Miami from 2015-2019. As an undergraduate, Felipe conducted research on neurolinguistic pain modulation in the Social and Cultural Neuroscience Lab. Following graduation, he worked as a Psychometrician for First Choice Neurology, where he helped refine a screening instrument as a predictor of cognitive dysfunction in white and Hispanic geriatric populations. Outside of the lab, Felipe plays soccer, occasionally engages in people-watching, and is on a quest to make (and find!) the perfect burger.

Research Interests
Felipe is a PhD candidate in Neuroscience under Konrad Kording and Michael Platt. He studies the neural basis of social primate grooming and spends his time building deep learning-based tools to analyze natural primate behavior and wirelessly recorded neural data. Felipe also studies how we can use deep reinforcement learning approaches (imitation learning and inverse RL) to model animal strategies in social contexts.
