Welcome! I am a graduate student in the Psychology Department at UC San Diego, working 
with Dr. John Serences. Broadly, my research interests are in visual perception and memory. Specifically, I am interested in uncovering how the brain flexibly supports 
the integration of perceptual information and our behavioral 
goals. To do this, I use a combination of behavior, fMRI, and computational modeling. I 
am also an open science enthusiast and am a proponent of practices such as preregistration 
and registered reports not only as scientific reforms but also as training tools for 
early career researchers. 

Outside of the lab, I am an avid runner and enjoy reading contemporary fiction, cooking, 
and watching TV shows (especially The Good Place).
