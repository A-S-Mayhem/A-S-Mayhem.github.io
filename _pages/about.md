Hi, I'm Paschal
I'm a PhD student at Purdue University's school of Electrical and Computer Engineering, currently advised by [Prof Jamie Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/).

## Research Interests
My research sits at the intersection of software engineering, security and cyber-physical systems. I work to improve the security and safety of embedded systems, through well-engineered software.

## Personal
I love discussing politics, startups and strategies. 
I love travelling and car trips. I can hardly resist the urge to visit a new city.
If I'm not working or reading, I am probably watching a movie.
I am passionate about Nigeria, and Africa.

## Recent News
- **May 2022:** I will be attending *ICSE 2022* at Pittsburg, through an NSF-funded travel grant.
- **April 2022:** I won the *2022 Magoon Excellence in Teaching award*, from Purdue's college of engineering.
