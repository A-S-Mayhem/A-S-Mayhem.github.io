I am a master's student at University of Chicago working with [Dr. Wilma Bainbridge](https://brainbridgelab.uchicago.edu/) and [Dr. Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) examining memorability and attention using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Previously, I worked with Dr. [Peggy St Jacques](https://sites.psych.ualberta.ca/MElab/) on investigating the influence of dimensionality on vividness of event-related episodic memory in virtual reality (VR) environment; Dr. Peter Dixon on mind wandering and cognitive coupling.
