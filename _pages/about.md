Hey, welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate data scientist at [Department of Health and Social Care](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health-and-social-care) based in London, UK. Currently working on probabilistic data linkage, anonymisation, cloud computing for big data, and transforming the data culture. I love working with people, extracting insights from complex data, developing predictive models, and communicating results effectively. I am excited to share my portfolio of data science projects, as well as my thoughts and interests outside of work. 

Before joining DHSC, I worked at [Office for Health Improvement and Disparities](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-health-improvement-and-disparities) and [Public Health England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england), to improve the health of the nation with data science. I have a MEng in Mechanical Engineering from University of Southampton and am over half way through my BSc in Data Science from York St John University.

If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out. I would love to hear from you!
