Your "About Me" section is well-detailed and paints a vivid picture of your experiences and interests. Here's a refined version for clarity and flow:

My name is Nicomedes, born in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. From a young age, I had a passion for machines and creating things. At just 12, I began working in a carpentry shop, learning invaluable skills from master carpenters. This curiosity spurred me on to explore various paths, each igniting new passions and providing profound lessons.

During my years as a magician, I honed my ability to engage with people and steer impromptu presentations. Photography taught me that the most intriguing details often lie hidden, awaiting discovery from a fresh perspective. Through music, I learned the importance of practice and reflection, recognizing the need to pause and evaluate our actions to avoid repeating mistakes. These pursuits not only enhanced my ability to express myself but also my capability to devise creative solutions.

My natural curiosity drove me to be highly competitive. I excelled in a broad array of sports, securing a bronze medal at the Bolivia Sub 19 Plurinational Games in 2015. In rugby, I became a pivotal player for my school team and the Old Navy club. I also claimed victories in horseback riding, volleyball, and soccer tournaments.

Academically, I stood out by winning science fairs with my inventions. Despite initial setbacks due to limited skills and knowledge, I persevered, learned, and ultimately achieved my goals, including success in math Olympiads. At 16, determined to study Mechanical Design Engineering, I moved to Chile for my final school years and took the PSU (University Selection Test), entering university like my peers.

Upon starting university, I found the Mechanical Civil Engineering curriculum overly theoretical with few practical applications. Driven by a strong desire for hands-on learning, I pioneered a double major in Mechanical Civil Engineering and Design Engineering. Today, I merge the best of both fields in research and development, producing the projects showcased in this portfolio. My interests are deeply rooted in R&D, technology, mechatronics, robotics, and aviation.
