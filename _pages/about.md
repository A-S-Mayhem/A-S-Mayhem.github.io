I am a  recent Mathematics and Physics graduate. I completed a Mathematics Specialist and a Physics Major at the University of Toronto. I am passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning and Applied Mathematics. I have contributed to research in Applied Mathematics in the subfield field of Mathematical Biology/Dynamical Systems.

I am currently working with a group of Data Scientists at RiskLab on a project involving applying machine learning models to [portfolio optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization)

I am also working with [Cameron Martin](http://cameronmartin.ca/) to finish a paper introducing our work (under supervision of Prof. Adam Stinchcombe) developing a mathematical model of a biological oscillator related to the Methamphetamine-Sensitive Circadian Oscillator (MASCO).

In March I will be joining Deloitte's Omnia AI team as a Data Scientist.

This website is still a WIP. Why are you here??
