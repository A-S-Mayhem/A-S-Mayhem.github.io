I am a computational and quantitative sociologist studying political sociology, social movements, organizational behavior, social inequality, and demography. Currently I am a Sociology PhD candidate at the [University of Arizona](https://sociology.arizona.edu/). My ongoing project focuses on the [antecedents](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/zhang_diss_ch1.pdf) and [consequences](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/zhang_diss_ch2.pdf) of working-class shareholder activism that seeks to improve corporate political transparency and accountability in the United States after 2000. My other work related to racial segregation, demography, organizational studies, and computational methods has been published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12419), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [International Journal of Comparative Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1177/0020715219837752), and [American Journal of Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1086/703044).
