Greetings!! I'm a research scientist at CEAâ€”French Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission. My expertise includes high-performance computing, finite element method, Boltzmann transport, and meshing. I hold a PhD in computational physics, a master's in computational fluid dynamics, and a bachelor's in aerospace engineering. In a nutshell, I'm the wizard of numbers and equations, blending science and technology to unlock the secrets of the universe.
