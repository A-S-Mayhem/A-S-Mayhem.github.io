I am a senior student in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department at Bilkent University. I am also a Machine Learning Researcher in [Prof.Dr.Suleyman Serdar Kozat](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/)'s research group. 

My research interests are **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, **Convex Optimization** and **Data Analysis**. The research I conducted with Prof.Dr.Suleyman Serdar Kozat focuses on machine learning and data analysis, specifically designing state-of-the-art algorithms for time series and spatio-temporal prediction and convex optimization of datasets in high-dimensional spaces. 

My journey through undergraduate studies and industrial experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in Machine Learning research, where I've honed my skills in exploring and analyzing distorted data, developing cutting-edge algorithms, and pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence.
