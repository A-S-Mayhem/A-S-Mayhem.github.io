About me
======
I am a principal health economist with a focus on infectious diseases, currently based in the UK. I am especially interested in dynamic transmission modelling, econometrics and programming. My Health economic modelling centres on HIV, Covid-19 and Antimicrobial resistance. I have presented posters at ISPOR EU and my work has been published in the Economist, FT and BBC. 

My undergraduate degree was Economics at Royal Holloway, University of London. I then worked in pensions for several years, until I discovered an interest in Research. Subsequently,I studied for my Masters in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University in upstate New York as a Fulbright Scholar. My focus was on the economics of automation (perhaps topically) and, separately, Environmental, Social and Governance based investing (ESG).

In my spare time I enjoy coding Raspberry Pis, running and watching the Green Bay Packers.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

How to contact me
======
