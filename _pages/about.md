I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics in the Department of Economics at Cornell University. My research interests include Development Economics and Labor Economics, specifically around the constraints and the incentives of human capital developments in developing countries. Geographically, my work has been concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Before coming to Cornell, I received M.A. in Economics from Yonsei University.
