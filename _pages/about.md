Ph.D. graduate in the School of Engineering (Mechanical, Manufacturing, and Mechatronics) from RMIT University, Australia. I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at the same
institution, 

Hello! I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Intelligent Automation Research Group](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/engineering/research/research-groups/intelligent-automation-research-group) at RMIT University, Australia. I received my Ph.D. at the same institution in 2022, under the supervision of [Prof. Alireza Bab-Hadiashar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-bab-hadiashar-0a881a31/), [Prof. Reza Hoseinnezhad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rezahn/) and [Dr Ruwan Tennakoon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruwan-tennakoon-923a3437/). 

My research focuses on the topic of <b>machine learning (ML)</b> and <b>computer vision (CV)</b> such as: 
* [ML] representation learning, domain adaptation and generalisation, Bayesian deep learning, information theory,
* [CV] geometric vision (3D reconstruction, stereo matching, optical flow), semantic/panoptic segmentation, image classification and object detection.

I have experience working as a <b>tutor</b> and <b>lab demonstrator</b> for the Machine Learning and Deep Learning at RMIT University, in 2021 and 2022. Formerly, I have also worked as a <b>lab demonstrator</b> and <b>teaching assistant</b> for two other subjects: Digital Fundamental and Introduction to Mechatronics. 

I activately serve as reviewer for top tier CV conferences such as ICCV and CVPR. I am passionate about acquiring new knowledge and delivering novel solutions developed from theoretical research to solve practical industrial problems. I also very much enjoy teaching&#128214;, doing research&#128187;, and drinking coffee&#9749;.
