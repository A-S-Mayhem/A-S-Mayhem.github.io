My name is Andrew Marderstein. I am a PhD candidate in the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine program, which combines the resources of Weill Cornell Medical College & Cornell University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Rockefeller University. I have conducted my studies at both Cornell's NYC and Ithaca campuses, within the labs of Olivier Elemento and Andrew Clark.
