Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography, co-advised by [Caroline Ummenhofer](https://ummenhofer.whoi.edu/) and [Delia Oppo](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/doppo/). My PhD research is focused on understanding low-frequency (decadal to centennial timescales) climate variability in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans as well as related impacts on the hydrological cycle. My main tools of analysis are earth system models of varying complexity along with paleoclimate archives.

I received my Bachelors in Chemistry from Columbia University in 2018. Outside of research, I enjoy playing tennis, skiing in the winter, and rock climbing.
