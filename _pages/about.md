I am a computational sociologist studying organizational behavior, social movements, and demography. Currently I am a PhD candidate in School of Sociology at University of Arizona. My dissertation uses statistical, network, and computational methods to study the antecedents and consequences of shareholder and stakeholder activism against U.S. corporate political spending practices and policies. My work appears in [Journal of Marriage and Family](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12419/full), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9) and [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001).
