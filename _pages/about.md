Hi! 

I am a fourth-year PhD student at IIT Delhi and also working as a Technical Lead at Wipro AI Research. 

My thesis revolves around analyzing and characterizing Harmfulness within memes. Besides spending a good chunk of my time looking at hundreds of memes that are both funny and outrageous, I primarily explore various computational solutions towards modeling the affective dimensions that these curious social multimedia artefacts exhibit. 

Specifically, I'm looking into aspects related to:

<ul>
  <li> Harmful Meme Detection</li> 
  <li> Harmful Targetting Detection</li> 
  <li> Semantic Role Labelling in Memes</li>
  <li> Meme Contextualization</li>  
</ul>

Prior to my on-going PhD program, I did my masters in the broader domain of Speech Signal Processing, with special focus on "A Study on Infant Vocalizations towards Classification of Paraâ€“linguistic Sounds".
