I am currently a second-year PhD student in Machine Learning and Optimization at Sorbonne University. I work within the Department of Statistics (LPSM) under the supervision of Antoine Godichon-Baggioni (Sorbonne University), Sylvain Le Corff (Sorbonne University), and Adeline Fermanian (Califrais). My research focuses on the theoretical aspects of Stochastic Optimization and Generative Models. Additionally, I am particularly interested in applying Deep Learning to solve Vehicle Routing Problems.
