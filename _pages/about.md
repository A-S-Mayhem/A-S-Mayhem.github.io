Welcome to my page! 

I am a first-year PhD student at the [Deparment of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/), [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). I am interested in information politics, political methodologies including text analysis and causal inference, as well as authoritarian politics with a regional focus on China. I received my Bachelor of Science in [Global China Studies](https://www.shss.ust.hk/ug/major/gcs/) from [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and [Bachelor of Art in Economics](https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/pse/en/) from [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/) in 2020. During my undergraduate period, I alsoenrolled in a dual-degree program initiated and funded by the [Bai Xian Asia Insitute](https://www.bxai.org/) and was a Bai Xian scholar.
