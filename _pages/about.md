I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Cognitive Sciences](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/) at the University of California Irvine and a member of the [Spatial Neuroscience Lab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/lab-members/). My advisor is [Prof. Elizabeth R. Chrastil](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/) and my research focuses on [human navigation and spatial cognition](https://lilianyou.github.io/portfolio/).

I received a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology from [South China Normal University](http://psy.scnu.edu.cn/english/), a Master's Degree in Geography from [the University of California Santa Barbara](https://geog.ucsb.edu/), and a Master's Degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from the [University of California Irvine](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/). 

Outside of research, I am a science communication advocator. As a co-chair of the [UCI Center for Neurobiology of Learning and Memory Ambassador Program](https://cnlm.uci.edu/ambassadors/) Adult Committee, I host events to help adults in Irvine cummunity to learn more about neuroscience. My passion for data science and science communication also drive me to be a [data science instructor](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/you-lilian-cheng) at Coursera teaching interactive and fun guided projects to global learners.

I go by Lily :)
