I am a lecturer in the [College of Information Science and Engineering](https://computer.haut.edu.cn), [Henan University of Techonology](https://www.haut.edu.cn). I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 2019 from [Center for Combinatorics](http://www.combinatorics.net.cn), [Nankai University](http://www.nankai.edu.cn).

My research interests include computer vision, machine learning and image processing, mainly focusing on
* image/video stitching
* image alignment
* image manipulation
* texture synthesis


Here is my [CV](tlliao.github.io/files/cv_ltl.pdf) (updated in Mar. 2020) and [contact information](#contact information).


## News

* [**2019.09**] Matlab implementation for Single-perspective warps has been uploaded on github.
  
* [**2019.08**] Our work on image stitching has been accepted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. Project page can be found [here](https://tlliao.github.io/projects/2020-spw).

## Research

I actively conduct research in computer vision and image processing. Visit my [publications](https://tlliao.github.io/publications/) page for more information.
