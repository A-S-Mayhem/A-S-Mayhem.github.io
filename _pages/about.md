Statistics PhD student based at Oxford, part of the Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Statistical Science. I am interested in scalable algorithms and the intersection between machine learning and traditional Statistical tools such as neural networks, Monte Carlo, Variational Inference and Bayesian Non-parametric models.

In addition to my PhD studies, I work with the [Rhodes AI Lab](https://rhodeslab.com/) (RAIL) as part of the modelling team.

Prior to Oxford, I worked in a modelling and analystics role for investment management firm, BlackRock. I did my undergraduate and Master's studies in Statistics at Warwick University and was awarded academic prizes in each year of my studies. My Master's dissertation was supervised by [Anthony Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/anthonylee/supervision), focusing on Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian non-parametric models and was awarded the Tukey Prize. During my undergraduate breaks I worked in consultancy as part of a corproate scholarship programme.
