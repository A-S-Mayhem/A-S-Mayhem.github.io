* I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xia (Ben) Hu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html). 

* Previously, I received the M.S. degree from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) under supervision of [Prof. Chen Gong](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cgong821/) and Prof. Zhengyuan Xu in optical wireless communication and networking center.

* Previously, I received the B.S. degree from [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) majoring in Electronic Information Engineering.

* My research interests lie in the broad area of trustworthy machine learning, particularly in fair and robust DNNs and GNNs. I am also interested in advertisement bid optimization.
