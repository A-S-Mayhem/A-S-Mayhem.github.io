Jiwon ("g-1") Kim is a doctoral student at Emory University's Political Science Department. She leads [the Interstate Shaming Events (ISE) data project](https://j1wonkim.github.io/portfolio/ise/), codes for the [Political Terror Scale (PTS)](https://www.politicalterrorscale.org/) and works with [the Oppression-Resistance Lab](https://oppression-resistance-lab.squarespace.com/) at Emory.

Jiwon studies the role of human rights and environmental norms at different levels of international politics. Her dissertation addresses human rights rhetoric as diplomatic strategy, and develops novel measurement of state shaming intensity. Her works use natural language processing (NLP), survey experiments, and network analysis. 
 

Jiwon has an interest in different models of collaborative research. Her passion for political science started when she was an exchange student in Hong Kong, during the Umbrella Movement in 2014. Jiwon received her B.A. in English literature and linguistics from Sungkyunkwan University in the beautiful and traditional neighborhood of Jongno in Seoul, South Korea.
