I am the 2022 Grace Hopper Postdoctoral Fellow in Computing Science at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. I am thankful to be hosted by [Dr. Aydın Buluç](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/) in the [PASSION lab](https://passion.lbl.gov/).

My research interests include parallel computing, cache-efficient algorithms, and performance engineering.

I graduated with my [PhD in Computer Science](https://credentials.mit.edu/certificate/bce7086eacde5e259b95a31ef69cd6ad) from the [Supertech group](http://supertech.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) in 2022, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Charles E. Leiserson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/).
My PhD thesis was on "[The Locality-First Strategy for Developing Efficient Multicore Algorithms](https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/143200)."

Here is a recent copy of my [CV](https://itshelenxu.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Please don't hesistate to reach out if you'd like to hear more about my work/start a new collaboration/spend a summer with me at Berkeley Lab! The best way to contact me is via email.
