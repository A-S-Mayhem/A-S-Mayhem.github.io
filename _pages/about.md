Jiwon Kim is a PhD candidate at Emory University's Political Science Department. She is also a coder at the Political Terror Scale (PTS) and leads the Interstate Shaming Events (ISE) data project, which is a part of her dissertation.

Jiwon studies discourses about political events at different levels of international politics. She is particularly interested in how foreign governments talk about each other's domestic human rights practices, how organizations of different ideological stance report the same conflict events differently, and what information persuades people to change their opinion about foreign policy.

To study these questions, Jiwon uses text analysis and survey experiments. She has particular interests in machine learning text classifiers, event extraction, and anaphora resolution, and in applying natural language processing (NLP) models on political texts with social science sensibilities.

Jiwon enjoys and believes in collaborative research, and has an interest in creating a healthy and sustainable culture in research labs.
She also likes reading and anaerobic exercises.
