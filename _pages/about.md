I am a final year undergraduate at [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) pursuing B. E. Computer Science. My interests lie in **Human Computer Interaction, Game and Web Development, Algorithms, and Natural Language Processing and Parsers**.  

I am currently working as an undergraduate thesis researcher at IHMI Lab at BITS Pilani under the supervision of [Dr. Surjya Ghosh](https://surjya-ghosh.github.io/) focused on Human Computer Interaction. 

I am always looking for opportunities to work on interesting projects.
