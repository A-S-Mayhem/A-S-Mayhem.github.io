**Mini Bio**: I am a Lecturer in Spacecraft Engineering at Queen Mary University of London in the UK. Previously, I was fortunate to be a visiting researcher at the DARTS Lab working under Dr. Abhi Jain at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I then also worked at the Surrey Space Centre based within the the University of Surrey, Guildford- again in the UK. It is these experiences that got me into the field of space robotics despite, building upon a fundamental engineering science-based PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California, Davis.
