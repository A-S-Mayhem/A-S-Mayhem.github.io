I am a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow in [Prof. Richard Murray](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page)'s lab at Caltech. My research uses a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to study and characterize cell-free protein expression systems.

Before joining Caltech, I received my Ph.D. from [Prof. Mark Styczynski](https://sites.gatech.edu/styczynski/)'s lab at Georgia Tech, where I focused on developing cell-free biosensors for point-of-care diagnostics. I earned my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Cornell University, where I was first introduced to synthetic biology in [Prof. Julius Lucks](https://luckslab.org)'s lab focused on developing RNA-based genetic regulators. 

Please refer to the [Publications page](https://yzhang952.github.io/publications) for more details about my research background.

My research interests span the spaces of bacterial synthetic biology, cell-free protein expression systems, self-assembly, biosensor diagnostics, and precision medicine.

My long-term research interest is to enable biology by design. [Read more here](/research/)
