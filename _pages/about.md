I am an Assistant Professor in the Information Systems and Operations Management department at HEC Paris. My research focuses on online learning on algorithms, with applications in digital advertising. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from ENSAE Paris in 2023 where my advisor was [Vianney Perchet](https://vianney.ai/). Before my PhD, I completed my master and undergraduate studies at Ecole polytechnique (France) in 2019, and graduated from the master MVA (ENS Cachan) in 2019, with a major in machine learning.
