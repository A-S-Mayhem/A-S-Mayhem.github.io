## :microscope: Research Experience

- **CRADLE: Constrained Reinforcement for Autonomous Driving Learning in Simulation-to-Real Environment** (Under Review)  
  *Oct 2021~Present*  
  Proposed a constraint-RL based formulation for the autonomous driving problem with lane offset and collisions constraints. Developed an autonomous driving algorithm which maximizes the driving distance while adhering to two different constraints. The proposed approach performs better than the previous RL-based approach on the specific autonomous driving task.

- **Mechanical Engineering Project "Individual Voting for RL and Search-based Algorithm Combination in Multi-agent Pathfinding."**  
  *Aug 2021~Oct 2022*  
  Proposed an Individual Voting mechanism to optimize the algorithm's performance in dead/livelock situations. A decentralized RL algorithm and a centralized search-based algorithm are learned to combine by Individual Voting. This mechanism significantly increases the number of successful pathfinding agents and the path planning efficiency.

- **Final year project "The Application of Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control Problem."**  
  *Sept 2020~May 2021*  
  Applied a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for the manipulator's robust operation. RGB image is input to the policy network, and Cartesian coordinate variables are output for manipulator controlling in continuous space. The algorithm achieves the autonomous grasping task for various workpiece structures without manually adjusting the control algorithm.
