I am a political economist at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=luuk-pieter-hendrik-schmitz) where I started my PhD 2019. At the moment, I am also a visiting researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Socities](https://www.mpifg.de/person/114102/2733). Previously, I was at Radboud University where I did both my bachelor's and master's in political science, and afterwards stayed on as a junior lecturer for one year.

My academic interest lie at the intersection of international political economy, economic sociology, and EU studies. My current research focuses on the political economy of EU industrial policy. I focus on a range of industrial policy initiatives tied to digitalization, the green transition, and strategic autonomy to understand if, why, and how Europe is shifting away from its ordo-liberal roots in promoting market-enhancing integration.

Beyond academia, I am passionate about music of various sorts and from different ages, play the French horn (badly), take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/136054004@N08/), like to read non-academic books, learn languages, and I like to see as much of the world and learn from other people as much as possible.

This site focuses on my academic endeavors. In the top column you can read more about my research, published work, and teaching.
