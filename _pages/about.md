My name is Z. Sun, a 3rd year PhD student at UCL. I am very very lucky to be supervised by Prof. F-X Briol and Prof. J-H Xue. My research is funded by EPSRC and UCL jointly. Prior to my journey to UCL, I obtained a MSc degree in Statistics with Distinction from the University of Oxford. 




Research Interest
