I am an undergraduate at UCSD with hopes to pursue a role in SWE. I am a Math-CS and Cognitive Science double major and enjoy auditing classes in philosophy.

I am currently looking for an internship position as a software engineer. Please check my [resume](https://godsped.com/cv) for links to my past experiences.
## About

I am interested in investigating the applications machine learning techniques and its intersection with various fields, particularly NLP. I see computers' knowledge of human language as the next big interface for humans to utilize computing power more naturally. I look forward to the day computers gain a semantic understanding of language. 
I am also passionate about the application of simulation in developing robust systems. I am currently looking into using Unity simulations to accelerate software development on aerial vehicles. Simulations can be integrated into automated testing pipelines and used for human sanity-check verification during rapid development cycles.
