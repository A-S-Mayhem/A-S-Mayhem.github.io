Welcome to my page! I'm Renyun Li, Master student from NYU ECE. My past research, internship, and education has intricately woven an electric and theoretical background, encompassing CV, SLAM, Optics, RL, 3D point cloud, and software-hardware co-design.
Currently, I focus on Image and Video Processing, 3D Vision, segmentation, reconstruction, motion estimation, and computational imaging.

In NYU, I'm fortunate to be advised by advised by [Prof. Yao Wang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang) in [Video Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/people/), working on 3D point cloud segmentation, motion estimation, and compressing.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and visa-related complications, my academic journey took an unexpected gap year (20'-21'). I joined NXP Semiconductors as a Software Engineer Intern in Edge Processing team, working on AIoT and 3D Vision with Mingkai Hu. After that, I joined [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) as a RA. Led by [Prof. Jianyu Chen](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/), we worked on RL, POMDP, 3D Vision, and Autonomous Driving.

Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering (under ECE) at Tianjin University, collaborated with Prof. Tiegen Liu, Prof. Hai Pang and Prof. Shuang Wang. Here is a episode. My original major was in Mechanical Engineering and minor in Automation, then I switched to EECS in the end of second year. Despite a 50-credit gap, an irreversible error by the department pushed me to complete a 4-year ECE degree in just 2 years. Against the odds, I conquered 54.5 credits in Fall 2018 and 46 credits in Spring 2019 (while the norm is around 25 credits).
