Hi, I'm a Ph.D course student in AI Graduate School at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST). Currently, as a member of Data Science Lab led by [Professor Sundong Kim](http://www.sundong.kim), I am focusing on developing human-like problem-solving, and decision-making AI. Especially, I am interested in solving puzzles that are challenging for current AIs.
