I am currently a third-year PhD student at [Statistics and Data Science Department](https://https://stat.utexas.edu/) in [University of Texas at Austin](https://https://www.utexas.edu/), supervised by [Dr.Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). My research lies at the intersection of Bayesian techniques into machine learning, with applications including **Reinforcement Learning** and **Generative Models**, I am also interested in **high-dimensional statistics** as well as **optimization**. 

In my spare time, I like palying **tennis** and **piano**.
