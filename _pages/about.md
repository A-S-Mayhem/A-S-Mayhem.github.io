Hi, I'm Aubrey J. Rembert, a computer scientist in the [Next Big Sound](http://www.nextbigsound.com) department of [Pandora Media](http://www.pandora.com). Currently, my work is focused on building large scale data integration systems leveraging techniques from machine learning and natural language processing. Prior to working at Pandora, I was a Research Staff Member at [IBM T. J. Watson Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com) studying machine learning approaches to enterprise integration.
 
I earned a B.S. and M.S. in Computer and Information Systems from [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University](http://www.famu.edu) and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Colorado at Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu). My research career has been focused on developing tools and techniques to support enterprise integration from both the data and process perspectives. I sometimes consult with organizations to help them develop strategies and tools to analyze their data and processes.
