I'm a doctoral researcher in the Computer Science department at Aalto University. My Ph.D. dissertation contributes methods to automate programming feedback using open-source language models, with a focus on supporting novice programmers in large-scale learning environments where individual feedback is hard to scale.

The broader goal of my research is to move beyond systems that rely on large language models and instead build lightweight, locally deployable learning tools powered by small models. My work blends reinforcement learning and source code modelling approaches with knowledge from programming education to effectively support students.

## A Bit of Background

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Aalto University, where I focused on intelligent systems (AI/ML). My master’s thesis, conducted with the [LeTech](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/LeTech/) research group, used data mining and predictive modeling to understand learning behavior in online programming courses. That work underscored how struggling with programming assignments is one of the strongest predictors of dropout—reinforcing the importance of timely, intelligent feedback.

From my time as a teaching assistant in programming courses, I’ve seen firsthand how challenging it is to support every student. This challenge continues to drive my research.
