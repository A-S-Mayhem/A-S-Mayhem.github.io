My academic pursuits center around the captivating realms of computer vision and the paramount importance of trustworthy machine learning.


During my time at the University of Tehran, I immersed myself in computer science. Alongside my math and computer science courses, I joined TaarLab (Human and Robot Interaction Laboratory) led by [Dr. Tale Masoule](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gkiFy20AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Here, I created an algorithm to help robots grasp objects better by analyzing their shapes. This innovative approach aimed to enhance learning algorithms by using specific grasp points instead of random ones. Our work got accepted in [ICEEconf](https://iceeconf.ir/2023) and will soon be published and indexed in IEEE.

Next, I worked alongside [Prof. Ngai-Man (Man) Cheung](https://sites.google.com/site/mancheung0407/), delving into generative models with a focus on diffusion models. I designed a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and tackled the challenge of training it using limited data. My fascination with generative models and their potential for improvement continues to drive my research.

During my high school, I participated in my high school team as a programmer in RoboCup IranOpen Junior Soccer League. Before joining University of Tehran, I was a high school student at the Allameh Helli 10 Highschool which is affiliated with NODET
