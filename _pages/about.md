Hello, I am Grant Wilkins. I love playing guitar, watching movies, reading, cooking, and doing some yoga/HIIT! When I am not doing those, I am a student at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/). There I research green high-performance computing, teach/mentor, and put on cool traditions. In general I am environmentally concerned, but excited about the transition to renewable (and smart) grids/energy.

Feel free to explore and/or reach out!
