Hello!

I'm a musician, anomaly detection and financial data miner, and philosophy and/or politics writer disguised as a Software Engineer. 

More specifically:
* I'm currently at Google, trying to not be evil and make the world's information accessible.

* I find myself thinking, talking, and researching about topics like Capitalism, Abortion, and Morality a great deal, culminating in almost uncontrollably writing for hours at a time when I probably shouldn't be.

* I'm in a two-person jazz-electronic-metal-craziness band with my friend Jeff Huang, having released a [song][https://powerfulgopher.bandcamp.com/track/dreamland-2]. I self-taught the guitar, drums, piano and had the asian rite of passage of formal violin training for a majority of my childhood.

* * The music I write/play by myself is [less intense][https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YbprIiT6MIqBpjudYWGgllr19DLbec58/view?usp=sharing], and currently just a lot of jazz chords with tonality similar to Joe Hisaishi or the Zelda: Breath of the Wild soundtrack. 

* * My roots are in a lifelong love of Progressive Rock/Metal music, earlier in my life with bands like Haken, Transatlantic, Neal Morse, Spock's Beard, Big Big Train, Dream Theater, Moon Safari, The Flower Kings, Genesis, Yes, and Pink Floyd. Recently I've been putting on tons of modern, instrumental guitar "djent" or math rock (Plini, Sithu Aye, Stephen Taranto, Thrailkill), jazz (Jacob Collier, Chick Corea, Hiromi Uehara, Holdsworth), and Korean R&B youtube mixes.

* Most of my free time is going to studying the behavior of U.S. equity market anomalies, or unexpected news events that cause anomalous volume and price changes. I've been developing automated trading algorithms and dashboarding/alerting systems for manual trading. All of this is for the obvious and ubiquitous life goal of financial independence, but I'd say I'm uniquely motivated in that I have an impossibly difficult TODO list for my life, involving large-scale artistic, humanitarian, and political goals. If I were to try to accomplish them without compromising my time, energy, or my goals' intent, I came to the conclusion that as a baseline I would need my personal money problems more or less solved.
