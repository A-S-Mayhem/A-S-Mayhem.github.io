I'm currently a PhD student in Statistics working with [Dr. Daniel J. McDonald](https://dajmcdon.github.io/) at the University of British Columbia. My reasearch areas are nonparametric regression, convex optimization, and time series analysis. I started doing the PhD program in September, 2020. Before this, I did a Master of Mathematics and Statistics Concentration in Statistics with [Dr. Maia Fraser](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/mfrase8/) at the Univeristy of Ottawa. I did my undergraduate in Economic Statistics at Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics, Zhejiang, China.
