This is my attempt at a personal blog. Hello World!

I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU. Before that, I was a Deep Learning Research Engineer at Deepen AI, an autonomous driving tooling company focusing on annotation and callibration capabilities powered by AI models and Computational Geometry.

Looking to get internship opportunities in the field of computer vision research and application. Interested in autonomous driving, 3D vision, and perception problems.
