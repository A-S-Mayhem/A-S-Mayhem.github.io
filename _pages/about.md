Hi there! My name is Aaditya Prasad but I normally go by Aadi. My research interests are centered around the synergy between computational neuroscience and deep learning. Specifically, I focus on developing deep learning based tools and models for understanding the cognitive principles underlying the brain's learning algorithms which I hope can inspire novel, robust deep learning systems. I just graduated from the University of California, San Diego in bioinformatics and I will be joining the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute's first Master's in data science cohort. I am currently comentored by [Talmo Pereira](https://talmolab.org) and [Uri Manor](https://manor.salk.edu) at [the Salk Institute for Biological Studies](https://www.salk.edu) where I will be continuing for my thesis. In my free time, I like playing video games, reading books, and hanging out with friends. If you're interested in collaborating or just chatting about life, please feel free to reach out!
