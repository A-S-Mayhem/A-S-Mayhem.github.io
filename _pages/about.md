Hi, I am Ata Otaran. I am a researcher in the field of robotics, virtual reality and haptic interaction. I develop tangible and smart interfaces that can interact with humans and the environment through haptic interaction. I am interested in combining robotics and human perception knowledge to design novel interfaces. 

Lately, I have been working on the design and simulation of nature-inspired metamaterial-based shape-changing interfaces. I have been also collaborating in or supervising many other projects on haptics, virtual reality and wearable robotics. Please feel free to roam through this website and send me an email to reach out!
