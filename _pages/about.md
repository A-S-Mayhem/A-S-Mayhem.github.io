I am a final year Ph.D. student at the University of Melbourne, working under the supervision of [Dr. Sarah Erfani](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/smonazam/) and [Prof. Christopher Leckie](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/people/staff.php?person_ID=6335). Mesmerized by generative models, I try to formulate various problems through the lens of generative modeling and bring that statistical perspective to them. In this area, I have an expertise with
* Normalizing Flows
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
* Probabilistic Diffusion Models (Score Matching)

Besides my in-depth experience with generative modeling, I have worked and am interested in the following areas:

* Adversarial Machine Learning (Adversarial/Backdoor Robustness/Attack)
* Coreset Selection
* Compressed Sensing
* 3D Reconstruction

I am always happy to discuss research-related topics. Just shoot me an email! :)
