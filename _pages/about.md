Hello I am Zach Mackin!

I am a Junior studying Statistics and Data Science at the [University of California Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). My research interests are centered upon Machine Learning, Computational Biology, and Applied Statistics. My coursework has been focused on Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science courses. 

I have done research and projects in a multitude of areas such as exploring a country's risk of defaulting with the [Economist Intellingence Unit](https://eiu.com) and accounting for growth in pollution within the Cheseapeke Bay with the [Chesapeake Legal Alliance](https://chesapeakelegal.org).
