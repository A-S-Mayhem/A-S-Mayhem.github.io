I am a PhD student in physics. My current focus is deciphering brain criticality with single neuron recording to understand brain function and identify abnormal states of neural dynamic network (like epileptic seizures, depression). My passion for science drives me to expand my knowledge and skills, hoping I can help people suffering from neurological conditions.
