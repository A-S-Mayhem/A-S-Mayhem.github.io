Hi, this is Yingxin Tan.I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural Economics at Purdue University. 

I have presented my works at national conferences such as the AAEA and SAEA annual meetings and is passionate about applying data-driven insights to inform policy and drive innovation in the food system.

I take a structured, goal-oriented working style to research by breaking down complex projects into actionable steps and set both short- and long-term goals to ensure steady progress and timely delivery. I also value clear communication and interdisciplinary team work. 

Research Insterest
======
My research explores how consumers navigate daily food choices, with a focus on food-away-from-home (FAFH) market, food safety, plant-based milk market dynamics, and broader food policy. I apply advanced data analysis techniques using Stata, R, Python and Nlogit and combines survey design and choice experiments to generate insights that inform both academic understanding and practical decision-making in the food system. I have extensive experience working with diverse datasets, including Nielsen retail scanner data, point-of-interest (POI) data, time series price data, the USDA National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS), and various choice experiment data. 

Education Background
======
I hold a Master’s degree in Agricultural and Resource Economics from UC Davis and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics with minor in Mathematics from Rutgers University.
