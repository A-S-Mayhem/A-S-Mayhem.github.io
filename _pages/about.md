I am currently studying my second M.Sc. in Computer Engineering, AI and Robotics at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) (Advised by [Prof. Hamed Kebriaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDseLNYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Majid Nili](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QlwWxmoAAAAJ&hl=en)). I hold another M.Sc. in Data Science and Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en) (Advised by [Prof. Fabio Fagnani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oqwlDQEAAAAJ) and [Prof. Giacomo Como](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7dju3QoAAAAJ&hl=en)). I completed my B.Sc. in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer engineering at University of Tehran (Advised by [Prof. Masoud Shariat Panahi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UwlyBw0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)). My current areas of interests are computational neuroscience, reinforcement learning, deep learning, multi-agent learning and optimization, and game theory.
