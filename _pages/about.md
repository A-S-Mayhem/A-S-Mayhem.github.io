My name is Z. Sun, a PhD candidate at UCL. I am lucky to be supervised by Prof. [F-X Briol]()(main supervisor) and Prof. [J-H Xue](). My research is mainly funded by EPSRC and UCL jointly; and partially by The Alan Turing Institute. In general, I am very interested in __computational statistics__ and __machine learning__. I have been working on Monte Carlo methods, variance reduction methods, Stein's method, kernel methods and meta-learning. 



## News
```
Apr 2023: Our paper _Vector-valued Control Variates_ has been accepted in ICML 2023.
