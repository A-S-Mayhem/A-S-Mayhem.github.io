I am at UCSB in the Ph.D. program in economics with an interest in Experimental Economics and Belief Updating. 
Especially, I am interested in the implication of biases in strategic settings.


I was born in Mexico City, I studied for my college and master's there.
Before, I got a bachelor's degree in Experimental Psychology 
and studied a Specialization in Applied Statistics at UNAM.
I studied for my master's degree in Economics at CIDE.
