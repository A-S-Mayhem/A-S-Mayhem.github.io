I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre of Excellence in Oil, Gas and Energy (CoEOGE), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). In this role, I am developing a novel software solution for estimating the trajectory of a Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) for the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). The work addresses multiple technical and logistical challenges that require constrained optimization for estimating the trajectory of a strapdown inertial navigation system. I have my doctoral degree from IITB-Monash Research Academy, a joint PhD programme of IIT Bombay (India) and Monash University (Australia). During my PhD, I worked in colaboration with Monash Institute of Railway Technology (Monash-IRT), to investigate optimization techniques for developing network based planning solutions for inspecting railway tracks alongside the scheduled trains using multiple heterogeneous instrumented wagons. I have a specialisation in Control Systems from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kgp) with a background in Electrical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Durgapur (NIT Dgp). 

**My research interests:** Optimization - *Offline Trajectory Estimation, Trajectory Optimization, Dynamic Programming, Column Generation, Branch-and-cut, Benders' decomposition, Deep Reinfrocement Learning;* and Control - *Extended Kalman Filter, Constrained Optimal Control.* 

**Systems/setups of interest:** *Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (considering Earth's manifold and rotation), Multi-agent time-dependent network, Quadruped, Robotic Arm, Inverted-cart pendulum, Fized-wing and rotory-wing drones, Unicycle (differential-drive).*
