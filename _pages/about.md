Hello! I am a 2nd year PhD candidate at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. I work with Prof. Erin Kara on extragralactic X-ray transients like Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and changing-look AGN. These events are particularly exciting to me because we can use them to study extreme accretion phenomena and learn about supermassive black holes that are usually dormant and hard to study! I work with a variety of observatories to study the evolution of these objects during their outbursts, including X-ray observatories like NICER, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift. In addition to X-ray transients, I also have broad interests in high-energy astrophysics and have also worked on high resolution X-ray spectroscopy of nearby AGN and the evolution of AGN feedback in high-redshift galaxy clusters.
