What you seek is seeking you (هر چیزی که در جستن آنی، آنی)  


<span style="font-size: 16px;">Farhad Rezazadeh (IEEE S'19, M'23) received the Ph.D. degree (*Excellent Cum Laude*) in [Signal Theory and Communications](https://tsc.upc.edu/en) from [Technical University of Catalonia (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/ca), Barcelona, Spain under the supervision of Prof. Christos Verikoukis and with the tutoring of Prof. Luis Alonso. He was honored to have Prof. Dusit Niyato preside over his Ph.D. defense session. He is currently a Researcher (*Senior Applied AI Engineer*) in the [Services as NetworkS (SaS) Research Unit](https://www.cttc.cat/services-as-networks-sas/) at the [Telecommunications Technological Center of Catalonia (CTTC)](https://www.cttc.cat/), Barcelona, Spain. Prior to his current role, he contributed as a Research Assistant at the [Advanced Broadband Communications Center (CCABA)](https://ccaba.upc.edu/en)/[NaNoNetworking Center in Catalunya (N3CAT)](https://www.n3cat.upc.edu/), under the esteemed guidance of Prof. Josep Solé-Pareta. He participated in 8 European and National *5G/B5G/6G* R&D projects with leading and technical tasks in the areas of Applied *AI* and *XAI*. His [*AI innovation*](https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovation/52337) in B5G/6G resource allocation was recognized as a great EU-funded Innovation by the European Commission's Innovation Radar. He was awarded the first patent connected to the H2020 5G-SOLUTIONS project. He was a secondee at [NEC Lab Europe](https://www.neclab.eu/research-areas/6g-networks) under the supervision of Prof. Xavier Costa-Pérez and had scientific missions at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lkn/home/), [Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)](https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/en/startpage), and [Universitat de Girona (UdG)](https://bcds.udg.edu/news). He is a Marie [Skłodowska-Curie Ph.D.](https://www.5gstepfwd.eu/#home) grantee and won 5 different *IEEE/IEEE ComSoc* grants, 2 [European Cooperation in Science and Technology](https://www.cost.eu/) grants, and a [Catalan Government Ph.D.](https://agaur.gencat.cat/ca/inici/) grant. He is an active member of IEEE Young Professionals and IEEE Spain - Technical Activities and Standards with more than 25 top-tier journals and conferences. He serves as Organizing, Chair, Reviewer, and TPC member in IEEE and Guest Editor in Elsevier.</span>

<span style="font-size: 22px;">Trailblazing AI Initiatives</span>
======
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">**Adaptive Standardized Protocol Learning**, An adaptive standardized protocol for addressing inter-slice resource contention and conflict in 6G network slicing. [[Access Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07362)]</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">**Explanation-Guided AI (In-hoc Explainability)**, The core concept behind the proposed approach is the intrinsic interpretability of the reward hypothesis in Deep Reinforcement Learning. [[Access Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283684)]</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">**SliceOps**, The proposed approach aligns with this philosophy of segregating the control plane from the user plane in 5G/6G by creating an innovative standalone AI plane to independently provide AI services and functions to the rest of the 6G network. [[Access Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01658)]</span>
- <span style="font-size: 16px;">**Brain-inspired Continuous Action in 5G/6G**, For solving continuous tasks, this approach adopts and fine-tune an alternative way of updating the actor (policy) in DDPG algorithm to speed-up convergence and fulfill a stable and robust learning process based on TD3 algorithm.
