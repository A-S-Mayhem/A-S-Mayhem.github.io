I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre of Excellence in Oil, Gas and Energy (CoEOGE), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), working in colaboration with the Pipeline Research Division of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). I work on novel software solution for estimating the trajectory of a Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) from its Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Odometer, and Above Ground Marker (AGM) data. I use online EKF based and offline optimization based estimation methods for estimating PIG trajectory. I have my doctoral degree from a joint PhD programme of IITB-Monash Research Academy, where I developed optimization techniques for network based planning solutions to inspect railway tracks using multiple heterogeneous instrumented wagons. I have a specialisation in Control Systems from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kgp) with a background in Electrical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Durgapur (NIT Dgp). 

**My research interests:** Optimization - *Offline Trajectory Estimation, Trajectory Optimization, Dynamic Programming, Column Generation, Branch-and-cut, Benders' decomposition, Deep Reinfrocement Learning;* and Control - *Extended Kalman Filter, Constrained Optimal Control.* 

**Systems of interest:** *Strapdown Inertial Navigation System, Multi-agent time-dependent network, Unicycle, Robotic Arm, Quadruped.*
