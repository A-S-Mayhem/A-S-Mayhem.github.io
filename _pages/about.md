I am a 4th year Economics PhD candidate at [University of California San Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu).

Prior to UC San Diego I did Master's in Economics at Central European University.


My research interests are in experimental and behavioral economics with a focus on learning and mental models. I also work on topics related to students' beliefs about mental health.
