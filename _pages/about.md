I am a PhD Candidate in the School of Mechatronical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology [(BIT)](http://www.bit.edu.cn/). In 2021, I graduated with a Master’s degree from BIT. In 2018, I got my Bachelor’s degree in North University of China [(NUC)](http://www.nuc.edu.cn/).

NEWS
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
