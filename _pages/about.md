I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [Economics Department at University of California San Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu). Prior to UC San Diego I did Master's in Economics at [Central European University](https://economics.ceu.edu).


My research interests are in behavioral and experimental economics with a focus on social learning, misspecified models and discrimination. I also work on topics related to student mental health and peer group support for online tutors.
