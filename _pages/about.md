Welcome! I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at the Deparment of Compuete Science, Emory University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Liang Zhao](https://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/). Previously, I received my master's degree in Statistics from the George Washington University in 2020. I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [School of Mathematical Science, Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China in 2018. 

Research
======
I am generally interested in **designing efficient, generalizable and explanable learning algorithms with theoretical guarantee**. Specifically, my current research topics include but not limited to: 1. Designing various learning strategies for more advanced and human-like AI, such as multi-task learning (MTL), continual learning, and domain generalization (DG). 2. Developing large-scale optimization algorithms with better scalability and performance, such as distributed parallel training for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and gradient free optimization via e.g. alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), etc.
