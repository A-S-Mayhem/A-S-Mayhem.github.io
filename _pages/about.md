I am currently a Research Assistant in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Washington](https://emitlab.ece.uw.edu/). I have completed my [Masters in Data Science at the University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/datasciencemasters/) and have done my B.Tech and M.Tech in [Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/). My professional journey spans five years, where I was fortunate to hone my skills at [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/in/), [OpsMx](https://www.opsmx.com/) and [Bosch Research](https://www.bosch.us/our-company/innovation/) transitioning from data analysis to specializing in machine learning and software engineering. I enjoy working at the intersection of research and engineering as I am fascinated by the entire range of problem solving, right from the underlying theory to modelling as well as to engineering.
