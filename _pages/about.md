I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I work at the intersection of materials science and machine learning. My expected graduation date is May 2023. Currently, I am actively looking for machine learning engineer (MLE) and data scientist (DS) positions.

Research Interests
------
* Synchrotron x-ray imaging of laser-matter characterization for failure analysis and quality control
* Automation and machine learning for image analysis
* Applied deep learning and data science
