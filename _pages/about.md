Larry Han is a third year graduate student at Harvard University in [Professor Tianxi Cai's lab](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/), working towards a PhD in [Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/). He received an AM in Biostatistics from Harvard in 2020, an MPhil in Operations Management from the University of Cambridge in 2018, an MA in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University in 2017, and a BSPH in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2016.

[His research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iZnTmxMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) focuses on developing new statistical methods to leverage real world data to improve decision-making in public health and clinical medicine. Specifically, his academic interests include robust and efficient estimation and inference using large-scale data generated from electronic health records and clinical trial data.

His current research goals include developing:
* Robust estimators for validating surrogate markers in observational data. 
* Semi-supervised transfer learning algorithms to improve pragmatic trial efficiency when the study endpoint is time-to-event, captured using imperfect surrogates in electronic health records.
* Communication-efficient, distributed learning algorithms that robustly estimate treatment effects in target populations under privacy constraints and site-heterogeneity.
* Principled approach for sensitivity analysis of design parameters in evaluating competing clinical trial designs.

He enjoys enjoy playing golf, rooting for his alma mater (UNC Tar Heels!), reading history, and staying up-to-date with global affairs.
