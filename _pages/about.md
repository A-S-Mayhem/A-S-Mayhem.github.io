Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](http://purdue.edu/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Bharat Bhargava](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bb/). 
During my Ph.D., I have worked closely with [Prof. Michael Stonebraker](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/michael-stonebraker) for the [REALM/SKOD](https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-launches-new-research-consortium-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning) project.
<!-- the A.M. Turing Award recipient Michael Stonebraker. -->
I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Purdue University and my B.Sc. in [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) from [Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/) ([B.Sc. Dissertation](/files/publications/ug-thesis-2014.pdf)). 
I also served as a faculty member at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology ([AUST](https://www.aust.edu/cse)) and United International University ([UIU](https://www.uiu.ac.bd/)).
<!-- I obtained my Ph.D. from the College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS), University of Massachusetts, Amherst under the supervision of Prof. Alexandra Meliou (Ph.D. Dissertation). -->

My research interests revolve around heterogeneous data management in general, 
<!-- and multimodal information retrieval in particular.  -->
but the application areas of my work have been interdisciplinary, spanning from data discovery and novelty management to 
<!-- machine learning,  -->
multimodal information retrieval, natural language processing, and video feature extraction. In collaboration with non-academic parties (e.g., West Lafayette Police Department, NGC), my systems are inspired by real-world use cases. 
<!-- I am interested in designing mechanisms for enhancing system usability and developing intelligent tools towards boosting productivity for a diverse group of users, ranging from end users to data scientists and developers. -->
<br>
I am interested in designing mechanisms for identifying patterns and novelties in heterogeneous data sources towards better understanding of the data, focusing on the explanability of the models to better use them for situational awareness. 


> **Open To Work:** Being close to finishing up my Ph.D., I am excited for my next adventure. I am looking for post doctoral or faculty positions. Please feel free to [reach out](mailto:ksolaima@purdue.edu) to me!

<!-- Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am also an affiliated researcher with the Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project and a research collaborator with the Research on International Policy Implementation Lab.
I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and my B.A. in Political Science from Haverford College. My academic work has been published or is forthcoming in International Studies Quarterly, Conflict Management and Peace Science, Political Science Research and Methods, and PS: Political Science & Politics, among other outlets. This research explores the causes and consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of institutions in international relations. I have teaching experience in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified instructor with The Carpentries. -->
