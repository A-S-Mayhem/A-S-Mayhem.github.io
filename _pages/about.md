👋 I am a PhD Economics Student at the University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, USA. 

I have a MPhil 🎓 in Economics from the University of Oxford, UK and a BSc 🎓 in Economics and Mathematics from LUMS (Lahore), Pakistan.

🔬 My research interests lie in three years:

Firstly, I use empirical macroeconomic tools such as reduced form VARs, structural VARs, Bayesian VARS and local projections to estimate the transmission channels of monetary policy 🏦 in both advanced and emerging economies. I have worked on papers which highlight the centrality of degree of central bank independence, inflation targeting regimes, fiscal conservatism, exchange rate regimes and degree of financial inclusion and stress in determining robustness of inflation to local and international shocks, especially across emerging economies.

Secondly, during my MPhil thesis at Oxford, I worked on extending a New Keynesian model to incorporate an endogenous, expectation formation process based on 
social learning among consumers 👬. Thus, in this research agenda, my goal is to enrich New Keynesian models by explicitly modeling the heterogeneity and 
herding dynamics with respect to positive and negative fluctuations in household 🏘️ sentiment.

Thirdly, I am interested in the macroeconomics of global 🌍 supply chains and production networks. The structure of global transportation through cargo shipping 🚢, air travel ✈️ and intra-national networks through trucks ⛟ is a key determinant of global business cycles. Even if the shock originated from some geo-political conflict such as in the Russia-Ukraine war, the propagation and amplification of the shock depends on structure of such supply chains. My goal is to understand such amplification and propagation both empirically and theoretically through use of input-output data and global business cycle models.
