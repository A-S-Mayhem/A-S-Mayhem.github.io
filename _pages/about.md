I am a PhD student at Monash University working on gamma-ray bursts, neutron stars and gravitational waves under the supervision of Paul Lasky and Greg Ashton.
I am a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and the Australian research council centre for excellence for gravitational-wave discovery, OzGrav.

# Recent News
* January 16th 2020: Submitted _Gravitational waves or deconfined quarks: what causes the premature collapse of neutron stars born in short gamma-ray bursts?_ to PRD. See it out on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06102). This paper took a long time but it was well worth it.
* November 17th-22nd November: This week I am in Lorne, Victoria for the Annual OzGrav retreat and ECR workshop.  
* November 8th: After a long, productive trip in Japan my visit comes a conclusion. Met heaps of amazing people, started several collaborations, lots of exciting science to come.
* October 27th-3rd November: This week, I am the Yamada meeting on gamma-ray-bursts in the beautiful city of Yokohama. I am presenting a couple of posters on my work on the population properties of long-lived neutron star merger remnants and extension of millisecond-magnetar models to include radiative losses.
* September 24 - October 25th: This month, I am in Kyoto attending the Yukawa institute long-term workshop on Multi-messenger astrophysics in the
gravitational-wave era
* July 7-12th: Attended the ASA conference at the University of Queensland, Brisbane.
* May 3: Conference proceedings of the Xiamen-Custipen workshop submitted (Lasky et al. 2019) _Neutron Star Merger Remnants: Braking Indices, Gravitational Waves, and the Equation Of State_
* April: LIGO-Virgo Collaboration paper, _Search for Gravitational Waves from a Long-lived Remnant of the Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817_ published in ApJ.
* April: Bilby paper published in ApJS
* February 18-22: Attended the LIGO Parameter Estimation group face-to-face meeting at Monash. Getting infrastructure ready for O3.
* February 4-8: Attended the annual ANITA workshop and school at Swinburne. Presented work on X-ray afterglows.
* December 18: _X-ray afterglows of short gamma-ray bursts: Magnetar or fireball?_ accepted in ApJ.
* December 4: At the Annual OzGrav retreat and ECR Workshop.
* November 7: Bilby paper (Ashton et al. 2018) submitted to ApJS.
* September 25: Submitted paper to ApJ, _X-ray afterglows of short gamma-ray bursts: Magnetar or fireball?_
