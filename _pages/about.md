I am a robotics engineer working on deep learning-based perception, path planning and controls for micro aerial vehicle (MAV) systems under the supervision of Dr. [Mozhdeh Shahbazi](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/contacts/mozhdeh-shahbazi) and Dr. [Gunho Sohn](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/users/gunhosohn). Before that, I got my PhD from Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Calgary, under the supervision of Dr. [Alex Ramirez-Serrano](https://www.uvs-robotarium-lab.ca/about-us). My PhD work focused on modeling, control, and simulation of a quadrupedal track-legged robot. 

I am passionate about robotics and a big believer that intelligent robots will play an important role in our daily lives. I am excited about any technology that improves the autonomy of robotic systems, especially a combination of model-based and learning-based methods to achieve a high-performance robot interaction with dynamic unstructured environments safely and effectively. I have experience in robotic perception and control, I am strongly motivated to conduct researches in robot learning. Robot Learning: How to integrate learning modules to physical model-based robotic architecture appropriately? Robotic Perception: I am working on perception solutions for micro aerial vehicles including visual SLAM, CNN object detection and tracking, and semantic segmentation by CNN combing traditional computer vision methods. Robotic Action:  I am trying to integrate the learning-based vision module with model-based path planning and control for autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles. I used to work on multibody dynamics modeling, control, and simulation of a quadrupedal track-legged robot.
