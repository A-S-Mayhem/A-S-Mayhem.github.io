Welcome! My name is Felipe and I'm  a PhD Candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Group at Penn. I study the neural and kinematic basis of social grooming in primates under the co-tutelage of Michael Platt and Konrad Kording. I spend most of my time thinking about novel computer vision applications for primatology. I'm also interested in deep reinforcement learning, and how we might build RL agents to study social behavior beyond the lab. If you have similar interests or simply want to chat, please reach out!

I am originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, but I completed most of my education in Miami, FL. For undergrad, I studied Neuroscience and Economics at the University of Miami (go Canes!). At UM, I hopped from lab to lab, and eventually found my way towards Dr. Elizabeth Losin's Social & Cultural Neuroscience Lab, where I helped collect data for work on neurolinguistic pain modulation in Spanish-English bilinguals. Following graduation, I worked as a Psychometrician for First Choice Neurology under Dr. Rafael Rivas-Vazquez, where I developed and administered psychometric assessments to individuals with neuropsychological disorders. Outside of the lab, I love to play soccer, people-watch at Clark Park, and rearrange my furniture.
