I (Chinese: 张勇军[audio](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/name.m4a)) am a computational social scientist studying politics, organizations, social movements, and inequality. I received my Sociology PhD in 2020 from the University of Arizona. I am currently working as an Assistant Professor of [Sociology](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/sociology//people/faculty/Zhang.php) and [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/) at Stony Brook University. I am also a research affiliate at New York University.

I combine statistical, network, and computational methods with large-scale datasets to study social, political, and organizational behavior. My past work focuses on the interplay between social movements and social or political changes in the U.S. and the globe. These studies have been published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/jomf.12419.pdf), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [International Journal of Comparative Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1177/0020715219837752), [American Journal of Sociology](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/Fiel-Zhang-2019_AJS.pdf), and [PLoS One](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/pone.pdf). I have won the 2020 James Coleman Award from Sociology of Education Section at American Sociological Association and the 2021 SIM Best Paper Submission at Academy of Management. 

My ongoing work focuses mainly on understanding mobility, segregation, and polarization in the U.S. I am using big data from FEC with corp data to track the polarization/partisanship trend in corporate elites. I am using population mobility data from [SafeGraph](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns) and Facebook as well as 190 million voter records and 260 million consumer records to assess the antecedents and consequences of racial/partisan/income/cultural segregation. This human mobility, segregation, and polarization project has been funded by an OVPR seed grant at Stony Brook University. I am also using deep learning methods to detect and monitor anti-AAPI hate speech and incidents (a direct result of polarization and xenophobia) from [Twitter since the COVID-19 outbreak](https://yongjunzhang.com/posts/2021/04/stopaapihate.md/). This project has been funded by a seed grant from IACS at Stony Brook University.

I am teaching Intro to Computational Social Science and Research Methods in Sociology at Stony Brook University. I am also guest-editing a special issue on computational social science and Chinese societies for Chinese Sociological Review.
