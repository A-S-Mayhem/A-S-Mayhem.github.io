I am currently studying my second M.Sc. in Computer Engineering, AI and Robotics at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). I hold another M.Sc. in Data Science and Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en). I completed my B.Sc. in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer engineering at University of Tehran. I have research experience in multi-agent learning, reinforcement learning, game theory, spiking neural networks, and brain-computer interface (BCI). My current areas of interests are multi-agent learning, brain-inspired learning, reinforcement learning, game theory, and computational neuroscience.
