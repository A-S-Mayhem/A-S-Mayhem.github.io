Hi! I'm Ashley, a lab manager at Dr. Maital Neta's [Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience lab](https://psychology.unl.edu/can-lab/) at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. I got my BSA in Neuroscience with an Evidence and Inquiry certificate at the University of Texas at Austin, and completed a thesis that investigated the effect of social rejection on memory processes, supervised by [Dr. Alison Preston](https://clm.utexas.edu/preston/) and [Dr. Jennifer Beer](https://sites.google.com/site/utselfregulationlab/welcome-to-dr-jennifer-beers-self-regulation-lab-at-the-university-of-texas-at-austin). At UT, I also was an undergrad teaching assistant for 3 in four different courses. 

I'm interested in learning how to analyze fMRI data, specifically using MVPA and RSA. I'm also interested in social connectedness, emotion perception and regulation, interpersonal and intergroup conflict, and applying psychological interventions to solve real-life misunderstandings. I'm also a fan of open science and teaching.  

You can find more information about my [research](research.md), or my [CV](CV.md) on this website.
