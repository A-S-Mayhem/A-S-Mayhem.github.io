I am a 2nd-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). I am supervised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). 

My research interests lie in deep learning methods on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graph. My research goal is to bridge machine learning models and symbolic human knowledge.

My research interests lie within the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. At the current stage, I am specifically interested in Pre-trained Language Models, Transfer Learning, Contrastive Learning, Knowledge Graph, etc. You can find my CV [here](/cv/).
