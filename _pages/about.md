======
I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at Northeastern University, supervised by [Prof. Lili Su](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/su-lili/). I obtained my M.S. degree and B.S. degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Jacob Whitehill](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/jrwhitehill).

My research interests are in machine learning, federated learning and uncertainty quantification. I am particularly interested in developing scalable machine learning algorithms that are resilient to levels of heterogeneity and distribution shifts encountered in real-world applications.
