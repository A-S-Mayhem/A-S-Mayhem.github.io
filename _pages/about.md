Welcome to my page! 

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (**MIT**). My research interests lie in **public, labor, and organizational economics**, in the context of **lower-income countries**. I have been involved in research projects in Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Senegal, and Togo.

If you're interested in talking about my work, or yours, get in touch!
