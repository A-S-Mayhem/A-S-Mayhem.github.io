I am a graduate in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. Currently, I work as a research assistant at Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, supervised by [Prof. Yu Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORPxbV4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I also hold a research assistant position at Westlake University, working closely with [Prof. Stan Z. Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Y-nyLGIAAAAJ). Previously, I was an research intern at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, supervised by [Prof. Wen Li](https://wenli-vision.github.io/). Before that, I collaborated with JD Explore Academy as an independent contributor, working with [Dr. Liang Ding](https://liamding.cc/) and [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html).

My research interests primarily revolve around the interpretability and representation capabilities of deep neural networks (e.g., properties of large language models), as well as the application of artificial intellligence in other research areas (e.g., AI + biology, phychology). Currently, I am actively engaged in the research on Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on designing efficient and effective structures (e.g., Mixture of Experts).

**I am currently preparing for a PhD program. If you find our research interests align or if there is potential for collaboration, please feel free to get in touch with me. I welcome the opportunity to connect.**
