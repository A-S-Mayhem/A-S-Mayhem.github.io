I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Oskar Klein Center at Stockholm University and Nordita Institute where I was previously a Nordita Fellow. I work on several aspects of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astrophysics, neutron stars, and transients more broadly. I did my PhD at Monash working under the supervision of Paul Lasky and Greg Ashton which was conferred in October 2021.
I am a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for gravitational-wave discovery, OzGrav, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
