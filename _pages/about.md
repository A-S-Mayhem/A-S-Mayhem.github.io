I am a Professor at the [Department of Communication](https://comartsci.msu.edu/departments/communication), [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu).

My current research interest includes computational social science, health communication, mobile analytics, and political communication. I am particularly interested in unraveling the structure & dynamics of human communication phenomena with various computational methods (e.g., network and spatial modeling, text mining, temporal and sequential modeling).
