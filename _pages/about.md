I am a first-year Neuroscience PhD student at University of California Berkeley. My research focuses on the changes in cognition and brain networks across lifespan and in neurodegeneration. I am passionate about open reproducible science, accessible science communication, and the intersection of knowledge and creativity through art and science.

Prior to graduate school, I worked in Dr. William Jagust’s lab at UC Berkeley researching cognitive functions and Alzheimer’s Disease biomarkers in healthy older adults using MRI and PET. At the University of Rochester where I received my BS in Brain and Cognitive Sciences, I studied human visual processing with Dr. Duje Tadin and social cognition with Dr. David Dodell-Feder.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, cycling, making art, and spending time in nature.
