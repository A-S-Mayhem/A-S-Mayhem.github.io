About me
======
I am a PhD student in Statistics at the School of Mathematics, [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk). Previously I studied physics at the [University of Crete](https://www.physics.uoc.gr/en/home) and mathematics at [Washington State University](https://www.math.wsu.edu)

Reseach Interests
======
I am interested in developping robust and efficient Bayesian inference methods for complex dynamical systems and signal processing. My PhD work is focused on Bayesian inference methods for state-space models.
