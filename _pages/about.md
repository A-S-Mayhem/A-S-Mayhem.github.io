Research Interests
======
I'm focused on theoretical and phenomenological high energy physics, physics-informed machine learning, the bridge between mathematical approaches and physical systems, and the ways computational approaches can be used to understand and develop that bridge. I plan to bring the skills and intution I develop during my research in these fields into the field of quantum computation and quantum sensing.
