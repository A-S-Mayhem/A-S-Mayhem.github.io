I am a Climate Mobility Researcher based at the University of Oxford. I am currently a <a href='https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/lisa-thalheimer/' target="_blank">DPhil candidate</a> at the <a href='https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/index.html' target="_blank">Environmental Change Institute</a>. My research focuses on the attribution of extreme weather events and human-induced climate change, and human responses such as migration and displacement. 

My research examines the interplay of extreme weather events and human mobility in East Africa in terms of quantifiable and attributable links to anthropogenic climate change. I investigate how droughts, floods and heatwaves affect population and conflict dynamics, and their effects on food security. My research employs methods from climate science (probabilistic event attribution) and social sciences (econometrics) to disentangle and quantify the complexity of climate-related human mobility. My interests further include the modelling of systemic risks which are informed by my professional and academic background: At the Earth Institute and the World Bank, I conducted analytical work and wrote papers on the link between poverty, climate policy, and disaster risk management in fragile countries. Working with the <a href='http://www.climateeconometrics.org/' target="_blank">Climate Econometrics</a> research group has enabled me to expand and apply my quantitative social science skillset by modelling the impacts of conflict and extreme weather events on internal displacement in Somalia. Using these research findings, I developed and applied a framework using probabilistic event attribution methods to investigate links to anthropogenic climate change during my research fellowship at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. My research has appeared on <a href='https://www.pbs.org/wnet/peril-and-promise/2019/07/what-is-climate-migration-lisa-thalheimer/' target="_blank">PBS</a> and the <a href='https://popgeog.org/2018/06/21/extreme-weather-events-and-population-movement-in-the-era-of-climate-change/' target="_blank">Royal Geographic Society</a>.
