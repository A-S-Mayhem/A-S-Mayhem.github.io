I am a pre-final year undergraduate student at [Birla Institue of Technology and Science, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/) with a major in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering.

My research interests include Brain-Computer Interface, Human-Robot Interaction, Motion Planning and Computer Vision. Moreover anything that eases our day to day life fascinates me.

Apart from my technical interest, my passion lies in [Photography](https://www.instagram.com/k_._._c/) and aviation

I am currently looking for undergraduate thesis opportunities in the fields of Human-Robot Interaction/Brain-Computer Interface from the Summer 2020
