I am a PhD student working on sound rendering, computer graphics, and vision under the supervision of [Dr Carlo Harvey](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/about-us/our-staff/carlo-harvey), [Dr Jason Hockman](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/digital-technology/about-us/our-expertise/our-staff/jason-hockman), and the external help of [Dr Alan Dolhasz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dolhasz/?originalSubdomain=uk).
I currently teach the C++ Programming for Games and Game Engines Architecture modules within the BSc (Hons) Computer Games Technology course. Before, I worked on several research projects as an intern at the DMT Lab. Among these was the [WMCA Serrano](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/research/digital-media-technology/research-projects/a-vision-based-system-for-road-traffic-monitoring) project, in collaboration with the West Midlands Combined Authority, which developed methods of analysis for intelligent traffic monitoring technology based on computer vision. I obtained a first-class degree in BSc (Hons) in Sound Engineering and Production (2019) from Birmingham City University, taking advantage of the final year project to conduct a subjective study on auditory perception in virtual environments.

I am currently running a user study: if you are based in Birmingham, UK and willing to contribute to my research, please take a look at [this page](./user-study/). Thank you for taking the time to read this :)

As part of ongoing research I am conducting, I have developed [my own spatialiser system](https://github.com/MattXV/DSPToolbox) for the Hololens 2 AR Headset as I needed one that included the ability of hot-swapping HRTFs and control over real-time Impulse Response convolution. If you are an AR developer, facing similar issue, feel free to get in touch with me :)
