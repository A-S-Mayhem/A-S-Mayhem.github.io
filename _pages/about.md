I am a Master of Mathematics (MMath) in Computer Science student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), part of the [Cryptography, Security, and Privacy (CrySP)](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca) lab, under the supervision of [Prof. Florian Kerschbaum](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/).

My main area of research is Deep Learning Robustness. I am currently researching the robustness of machine generated text (e.g. LLM) detectors.
