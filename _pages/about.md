I am a full-stack engineer with over <b>17</b> years of experience
whose passion lies in building great products while enabling others to perform their roles more effectively.
I have architected and built horizontally scalable applications atop Java based technical stack; distributed RESTful API services;
web-based front-ends with modern, highly interactive Ajax UIs and a cloud-based platform using AWS.
