 I am a Chilean lawyer and a an academic fellow at Stanford, where I also earned an MA in Economics and a JSM degree. My research focuses on the application of behavioral insights to competition policy, corporate governance, economic regulation, and the empirical analysis of law and its policy implications. I received my LL.B. summa cum laude from Universidad de Chile (2013), an LL.M. from Harvard Law School (2016), and a J.S.M. from Stanford Law School (2018), where I graduated with full-honors and was awarded my first John M. Olin Fellowship in Law and Economics. I am qualified to practice as a barrister in Chile, where I worked for the Chilean antitrust authority, handling monopolization (abuse of dominance) cases in both unregulated and regulated markets (mainly financial and pharmaceutical markets). I have taught seminars on antitrust and law and economics at Universidad de Chile and visited the University of Oxford Centre for Competition Law and Policy as a visiting researcher. Before coming to Stanford, I worked as a competition expert for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), conducting a competition assessment of the pharmaceutical sector in Mexico.
