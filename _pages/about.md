I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I work in the NLP Group under Professor William Wang. My research focuses on natural language processing, with an emphasis on Responsible AI. I work on problems relating to fairness, trustworthiness, and safety. I have spent summers as a research intern at AWS AI, Meta, and Pinterest. I am a 2022 EECS Rising Star, a current recipient of the Amazon Alexa AI Fellowship for Responsible AI, and have previously received the Regents and Holbrook Fellowships at my university.
