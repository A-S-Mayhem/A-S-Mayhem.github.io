I am Sr. Data Scientist at the [PsychoGenics](https://www.psychogenics.com/). I joined the data science team in 2020 and have been worked on various AI related projects for phenotying disease model and screening novel drugs using computer vision techniques on animal behavior. 

My main research topic is to build a hardware/software system that can collect videos of rat behaviors and classify the subject automatically.
