# About

I'm a Computer Science student at the University College London. 

### My interests

I'm interested in natural language processing, text generation and image recognition. I have experience working on large-scale computer clusters, supercomputers in Europe (Okeanos, Rysy, Topola), Asia (NSCC supercomputing resources), North America (Moniuszko) and in the cloud (Microsoft Azure). 


### My professional experience

I have gained my first experience in software engineering at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Compuatational Modeling of the University of Warsaw. I worked on optimizations to some linear algebra algorithms by implementing their parallel version using C++/MPI and utilizing a state-of-the-art system-on-chip (SoC) programmable network engine from Mellanox Technologies. At ICM UW, I have also worked on a web application project in Django, Bootstrap. 

At Calmsie, I have built the backend API, frontend and iOS mobile app prototypes codebase. I have deployed the application to a CentOS server, hosted multiple domains, administered and maintained the server. 


Please, feel free to contact me about anything!
