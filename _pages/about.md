Hi, I'm Xavier  I love coding, and apply new ways to solve problems related to real world events. I like technology and the relationship it has with the various fields of knowledge.

In this website, I would like to share my experience about topics and applications of statistics and data science at Blog Posts. Besides, the Portfolio contains my  projects. In Publications, I have uploaded my published paper. If you want to know more about me, you can download my resume at CV.
