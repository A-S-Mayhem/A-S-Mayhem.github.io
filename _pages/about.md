My Chinese name is 赵(Zhao)禹(Yu) and currently I am a project researcher from Kavli IPMU, University of Tokyo. I will be in the job market for the tenure track positions this year.


Research Interest
======
I am a geometric representation theorist, who aims to build a bridge between representation theory with algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and mathematical physics. Right now I am also working on the birational geometry of derived algebraic schemes/stacks. My research can be roughly divided into the following aspects:

1. geometric representation theory, especially the representation theory of Yangians, quantum groups, and cohomological Hall algebras.
2. derived algebraic geometry, especially the geometry of quasi-smooth and shifted symplectic stacks.
3. birational geometry, especially the vanishing theory for algebraic varieties.


Education and Employment
