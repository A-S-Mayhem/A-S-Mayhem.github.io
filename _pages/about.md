I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, and I am fortunate to be advised by [Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/).


I am interested in developing novel techniques that can improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLM) for generating and understanding code and 3D models. My long-term research goal is to build intelligent systems that can assist engineers, developers, and designers in streamlining their tasks. My current research at the [CORE lab](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/) involves building intelligent systems that assist in manufacturing.
