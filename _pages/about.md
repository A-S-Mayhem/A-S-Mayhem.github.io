I am a third-year PhD student in the Neurobiology program at the California Institute of Technology ([Caltech](https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/)). My advisor is Prof. [Markus Meister](https://meisterlab.caltech.edu/markusmeister). I am interested in cognitive flexibility, learning and memory in mice and humans. Currently I am working on Project titled "[Mice in Manhattan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULZqNH9vWPA&ab_channel=MouseMazeData)," using a novel reconfigurable maze to study rapid learning and flexible routing. 

Prior to Caltech, I did my undergraduate studies at Cornell University (B.S. in Biological Engineering) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (B.Eng. in Food Science and Engineering). I then obtained a Master's degree in Education and Psychology at the University of Cambridge.
