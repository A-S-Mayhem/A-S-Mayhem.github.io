Ezekiel Soremekun is a Research Associate at 
SnT- Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, 
University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg. 
Ezekiel's research is focused on software engineering (SE), espeically software validation. 
This includes SE areas such as the 
automated debugging, software testing, security analysis and program analysis.
He is interested in studying both functional properties (e.g., correctness)
and non-functional properties (security, robustness, and fairness) of 
software systems, including aritificial intelligence (AI) -driven systems.

Research Statement
---

My research objective is to apply scientific methods to validate software systems. Software
systems have become increasingly complex, such that it is impossible to ensure their
correctness without proper validation. It is a difficult challenge to validate software for relevant
properties such as correctness (e.g. failure) and security. 

My over-arching research aim is to provide useful software validation techbiques, tools and data for the following:
   * Software Testing: systematically exposing unexpected program behaviors, 
   * Automated Debugging: automatically diagnose, mitigate and repair such incorrect behaviors, 
   * Human Factors in SE: study developer behaviors during software testing and debugging activities, and 
   * Human-in-the-loop: build testing and debugging tools that account for developer behaviors and interactions in practice. 

My goal is to address these key challenge by developing methods and tools to support developers during testing and debugging activities.
