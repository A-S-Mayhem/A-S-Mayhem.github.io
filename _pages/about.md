I am a PhD Candidate in Public Administration at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/">Maxwell School</a> at Syracuse University.


My **research** is at the intersection of **environmental and innovation policy**.  I study how **public policy shapes the development and diffusion of technologies needed to advance decarbonization goals**. 

My fields of specialization are **environmental and energy policy**, and **policy process**.
