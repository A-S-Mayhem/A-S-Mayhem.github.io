My name is Z. Sun, a 2nd year PhD student in machine learning and computational statistics at Department of Statistical Science, University College London. I am very very lucky to be supervised by Prof. F-X Briol and Prof. J-H Xue. 


Research Interest
======
In general, I am very interested in __computational statistics__ and __machine learning__. Recently, I have worked on meta-learning, control variates and Stein's method.
