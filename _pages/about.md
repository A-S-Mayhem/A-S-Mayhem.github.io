I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Cincinnati majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. I am currently interested in bioinformatics and the applications of machine learning in functional genomics. In particular, my current active projects include building novel deep learning models for transcription factor binding site predictions, reimplementing a computational model for measuring drug perturbations in cancer, and evaluating generative models for liver ultrasound images. Other fields that I want to try out include graph neural networks for drug design and deep reinforcement learning for playing games. My overall theme of my research is that I am trying to build interpretable machine learning models that help us understand biology and medicine better.

Besides the academics, I'm an avid chess and badminton player, and I also play the guitar.
