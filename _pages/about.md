Hi, I am Xin Luo's homepage. I received my Ph.D. degree from Tongji University in 2019, and now I am a postdoctoral researcher at Shenzhen University. 
My interests include remote sensing techniques, such as multispectral/hyperspectral image processing, SAR/Lidar altimetry data processing, and the related application in hydrology. And i am also interested in machine learning/deep learning techniques.
