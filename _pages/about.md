I am interested in understanding complex multi-agent behavior and imbuing robots with agility and intelligence. I tackle these problems using techniques from machine learning, optimization, game theory, and biology. I am also a zoologist. I aim to draw computational tools from robotics and AI to study animal behavior. Currently, I am studying the movement ecology of large marine predators with Dr. Barbara Block at the Hopkins Marine Station.
