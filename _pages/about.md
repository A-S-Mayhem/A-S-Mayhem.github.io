My name is Zhuo Sun, a 2nd year PhD student in Statistics at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I am very very lucky to be supervised by [Prof. F-X Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io) and [Prof. J-H Xue](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakjxu/). Before that, I accomplished my M.Sc in Statistical Science at [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Prof. George Deligiannidis](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/) and my advisor there was [Prof. Gesine Reinert](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~reinert/). I am a recipient of Cambridge International Scholarship. Currently, my PhD is fully funded by EPSRC and UCL jointly.

Research Interest
======
In general, I am very interested in computational statistics and machine learning. Recently, I have worked on meta-learning, control variates and Stein's method. 

- Meta-learning targets at the learning problems when only a small set of samples are available for training. It is all about how to make use of past knowledge to generalize on novel unseen tasks. 

- Control Variates methdods aim to get an estimator for integration problems which largely reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimators especially when sample size is small.
