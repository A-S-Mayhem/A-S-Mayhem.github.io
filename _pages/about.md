Currently, I am a Data Analyst at the Max Planck Institute of Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. I work in the Research Group Learning in Early Childhood. My main responsibility is to design pipelines for processing Neuroimaging data from multiple modalities. 

I have completed my masters in Life Science Informatics student from the University of Bonn, Germany. My research interests lie at the intersection of Medical Imaging and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in analyzing data from Neuroimaging studies.  In the future, I want to contribute towards enhancing the mechanistic interpretability of prediction of diseased states from neuroimaging studies disease and communicate findings with a wide audience even outside academia. 

Apart from my academic interests, I enjoy getting to know new people and perspectives. In my free time I like to read popular Science books and dance.
