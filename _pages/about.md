My name is Yuke Wang, a second-year Ph.D. in [computer science](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu) at [UCSB](https://ucsb.edu). Before I come to UCSB, I got my B.E. in software engineering from [UESTC](http://en.uestc.edu.cn/). At UCSB, I am working with Prof [Yufei Ding](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yufeiding/). I have been working on projects in software-hardware co-design for distance-related algorithms, such as KNN, KMeans. I am also interested in deep learning, especially graph neural network (GNN) optimization and acceleration on heterogeneous platforms, such as GPUs.
