I am 
(1) a research engineer focused on environmentally relevant electroseparations, specifically in treatment of inorganic wastes and pollutants, 
(2) a pedagogy scholar with an interest in subversive teaching techniques and curricula development that de-centers western epistemologies and dismantles epistemic hierarchies, and 
(3) an installation artist who uses traditional art objects, written and spoken word, and narrative theory to encourage the confrontation of preconceived biases.
