- [Dr. Daniel Sonntag](https://www.dfki.de/~sonntag/), Scientific Director of Interactive Machine Learning Department, DFKI Saarbr√ºcken.

## Education

**University of Science, Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam**
  - BS, Computer Science, Advisor: [Assoc. Prof. Binh T. Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/site/ntbinhpolytechnique/home).
  - [Honors Program in Mathematics and Computer Science], - a highly selective program with only 30 students chosen out of 300.
  - I graduated within with a GPA of 9.12/10.0 and an exceptional thesis (10.0/10.0).
  - The university is one of the best undergraduate institutes in Vietnam in Mathematics.

## Research interests
Currently, I am in the AI Residency program at FPT Software AI Center, one of the only two AI residency programs in Vietnam, working with Dr. Thieu N. Vo and Dr. Tan M. Nguyen. I am interested in combining the well-studied theoretical tools of optimization and differential equations with the empirical success of machine learning. The research agenda I would like to pursue next consists of two following directions:
  - **Optimization and differential equations for understanding and designing ML methods:** How can the theoretical frameworks from optimization and differential equations help us understand successful deep learning methods and design novel ML methods that perform better, are more efficient, and are more flexible?
  - **Neural differential equations for Scientific Modeling:** How can neural differential equations - a synthesis of neural networks and differential equations - enable new capabilities in scientific modeling?

I am interested in solving problems in Machine Learning from *first principles*, because I believe in a systematic way forward for understanding and utilizing Deep Learning in different domains, particularly, *AI4Science*. From these research directions, I want to make current Machine Learning models (esp. Deep Learning) robust to (un)known unknowns. This interest stems from my fascination with the possible role of AI in aiding humans' understanding of physics in "I, Robot" and "Foundation" by I. Asimov.

## Previous research experience

For my undergraduate thesis (2022), I worked on the problem of *Fall Detection*. The thesis is on the topic of *Computer Vision* as well as *Medical domain*, which interested me because I wanted to explore the synthesis of the profound progress made by the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities.

From 8/2022 to 4/2023, I was a Research Intern at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). I worked on utilizing *Self-supervised learning* for Medical data.
