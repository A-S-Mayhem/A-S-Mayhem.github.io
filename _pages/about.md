Hello! I am Rachael Phillips, a Senior Consultant for Microsoft Consulting Services in the Azure Cloud and Artificial Intelligence realm based in Northern California! I am a Data and Analytics Consultant by training with a masters in Mathematics from San Francisco State University. My research, teaching and tutoring experience, and service to my clients are founded off the idea that data is a tool to build up and improve our personal lives, our business lives and everything in between! 

My Work Experience
======
For the past 5+ years, I have helped numerous clients improve their businesses by implementing solutions in Azure Cloud Services for a multitude of purposes. These include projects for predictive maintenance, forecasting time series, document classification, speech to text analysis, migrating on-prem data to the cloud, business intelligence reports, text comparison, etc. These projects included many technologies, but I have worked mainly with the Azure stack. I enjoy learning new technologies, as well as helping my clients! Data - it's what I do!

My Background and History
======
I received my masters of arts degree in Mathematics at San Francisco State University in 2016. During that time, I wrote my thesis on [relating gene expression profiling to copy number changes with different sub-types of breast cancer] (https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/concern/theses/x920fz53t). Since then, I have went from an Associate Consultant to Consultant to a Senior Consultant with 3 different consulting firms until I reached Microsoft, my current company.  

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
