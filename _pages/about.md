I am an undergraduate studying AI and robotics at Stanford. I work in the [Stanford Multi-Robot Systems Lab (MSL)](https://msl.stanford.edu/) with Prof. Mac Schwager. I have also worked on animal conservation and zoology - using computational tools from robotics and AI to study animal behavior. I have previously worked with Dr. Barbara Block at Stanford and Dr. Tim Higham at UC Riverside.
