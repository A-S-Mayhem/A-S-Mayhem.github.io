I am an economist interested in firm dyanamics and their relevance for aggregate outcomes. My research also touches on international rate and entrepreneurship. I received my PhD from NYU in 2018 and am currently a Research Economist at the Bank of Portugal.

**What are Uncertainty Shocks?** (with Anna Orlik and Laura Veldkamp)<br/>
Journal of Monetary Economics, 2018, 100:1â€“15

Many modern business cycle models use uncertainty shocks to generate aggregate fluctuations. However, uncertainty is measured in a variety of ways. Our analysis shows that the measures are not the same, either statistically or conceptually, raising the question of whether fluctuations in them are actually generated by the same phenomenon. We propose a mechanism that generates realistic micro dispersion (cross-sectional variance of firm-level outcomes), higher-order uncertainty (disagreement) and macro uncertainty (uncertainty about macro outcomes) from changes in macro volatility. If we want to consider ''uncertainty shocks'' as a unified phenomenon, these results show what such a shock might actually entail.
