A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other 

Getting started
======

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml]

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, 

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
