Hi, I am Ata Otaran. I am a researcher in the field of robotics, virtual reality and haptic interaction. I develop tangible and smart interfaces that can interact with humans and the environment through haptic interaction. I am interested in combining robotics and human perception knowledge to design novel interfaces. 

Lately, I have been working on metamaterial-based shape-changing interfaces for creating different tangible surface topologies to support physical interaction. So far the only academic output of this curiosity has been a design and simulation tool that helps designers construct actuated shape-changing interfaces with nature-like movement capabilities, which I will present in TEI'25 conference. I have been also collaborating in or supervising many other projects on haptics, virtual reality and wearable robotics. 

On this website, you’ll find highlights of my research, projects, and publications. Feel free to explore, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect or discuss potential collaborations!
