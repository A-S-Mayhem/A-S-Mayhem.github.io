Iâ€™m Mehdi Momen, a post-doctoral research associcate at the Department of Animal and Poultry Sciences at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT).


Research Interet 
======
My research interests span a broad range of topics including animal breeding, plant breeding, and human quantitative genetics. I am particularly interested in applying statistical learning methods to multi-layer omic data, dissection of the genetic architecture of complex traits, predictive ability of dense arrays of variants for animal, plant and human populations. The primary research areas I want to focus on, deriving the prediction error variance by using bootstrap aggregation sampling and investigated the relationship between empirical connectedness measures and prediction accuracy in the cross-validation framework. Also demonstrated the potential of non-parametric relationship matrices to quantify genomic connectedness and prediction accuracy in the presence of non-additive gene actions. Subsequently, development of algorithms finds an optimized training set from a larger set of candidate individuals such that it minimizes the prediction error variance in the test set.
