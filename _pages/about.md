Ezekiel Soremekun is a Research Associate at 
[SnT](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt) 
-- Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, 
at the 
[University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu), Luxembourg. 

Education
---------
He was previously a researcher and PhD Candidate at 
[CISPA](https://cispa.de/en) and 
[Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), respectively. 
He was a graduate student (2013-2016) at the 
[Saarbr√ºcken Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de).
He possesses a MSc in Computer Science (2011) from 
[African University of Science and Technology](https://aust.edu.ng)
and a BSc in Software Engineering (2010) from
[American University of Nigeria](https://www.aun.edu.ng).

Research Statement
-------------------

Ezekiel's research is primarily focused on *software engineering* (SE), especially *software validation*. 
This includes SE research concerns such as automated debugging, software testing, 
program analysis, and security testing. 
He is interested in studying both functional properties (e.g., correctness)
and non-functional properties (e.g., security, robustness, and fairness) of 
software systems, including aritificial intelligence (AI) -driven systems (e.g., automated classifiers). 

Ezekiel's research objective is to *apply scientific methods to validate software systems*. 
Software systems have become increasingly complex, such that it is impossible to ensure their
correctness without systematic validation.

The main goal is to address these key challenges 
by *developing methods and tools to support developers 
during software testing and debugging activities*.

The over-arching research aim is to provide useful validation techniques, tools and empirical data for the following:
   * __Software Testing__: *systematic generation of test inputs* to expose unexpected program behaviors, 
   * __Automated Debugging__: how to *automatically diagnose, mitigate and repair* incorrect program behaviors, 
   * __Human Factors in SE__: studying *developer behaviors* during software testing and debugging activities, and 
   * __Human-in-the-loop SE__: building testing and debugging tools that *account for developer behaviors, needs 
and interactions in software practice*.
