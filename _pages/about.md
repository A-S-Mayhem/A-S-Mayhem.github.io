I am Hyunwoo Kwon and I am a junior at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I am also a undergraduate researcher for two research groups at UIUC. I have been participating in building automation devices that are optimized in time and performance. I not only come up with the designs for these setups, but also create software dedicated to control these devices. Please check out my portfolio for a elaborated explanation of my work.

I enjoy working in interdisciplinary fields where I can combine knowledge in multiple fields, especially my knowledge in mechanical engineering with software and circuit design.
