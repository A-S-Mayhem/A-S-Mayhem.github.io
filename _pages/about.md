# About Me 🌿

Hi there! I'm Majid Rebouh, an exhibit technician with a passion for blending plant biology, technology, and AI to create innovative solutions for environmental restoration and education. 

## What I’m Interested In 🔎

I’m fascinated by the intersection of plant biology and technology, particularly in exploring how AI and robotics can be used to restore environments and foster sustainability. From building smart ecosystems to designing machines that mimic nature, I thrive on projects that bridge science and creativity.

## What I’m Working On 📝

### Raspberry Pi Voice-Activated LLM 🗣️
A personal assistant project using a Raspberry Pi and a large language model (LLM). This voice-activated system is designed to help streamline daily tasks and provide a conversational interface for technical queries.

### Terrarium 🪴
An intricately designed, self-sustaining terrarium that integrates sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and light levels, blending aesthetic appeal with functional technology.

### Monitored Growth Grass Tank 🌱
A controlled environment for studying grass growth, equipped with sensors to track soil moisture, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions in real time.

### Exhibit Explainer Robot 🤖
A robot built to enhance visitor engagement at exhibits, using AI-powered interactions to provide insightful explanations about science and technology displays.

### Mini FPV Car 🚙
A first-person-view (FPV) miniature car designed for immersive remote driving experiences, combining engineering precision with an emphasis on user-friendly controls.

## How I Can Help 👯

I enjoy collaborating on projects at the intersection of biology, technology, and education. Whether you’re looking to:

- Develop AI-powered systems for environmental monitoring
- Design and prototype interactive robotics
- Build smart ecosystems with IoT integration
- Create educational tools for exhibits or classrooms
