Hello there! 
After studying [Mathematics](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/) and [IT-Security](https://informatik.rub.de/en/) I am deepening my knowledge in Quantum Information and Cryptography as a PhD Student in the [Quantum Information group](https://qi.rub.de) at [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en) and [CASA - Cybersecurity in the Age of Large-Scale Adversaries](https://casa.rub.de/en/).
I am jointly supervised by [Prof. Dr. Michael Walter](https://qi.rub.de/walter) from Ruhr University Bochum and [Asst. Prof. Dr. Giulio Malavolta](https://sites.google.com/view/giuliomalavolta/) from Bocconi University and Max-Planch Institute for Security and Privacy.

I am generally interested in Cryptography, Cryptanalysis, Theoretical Computer Science and Quantum Information.
