About Me
======
A theoretical chemical engineer by training, my main research focus lies in studying the thermodynamics in various emerging systems. With the booming of nanotechnology and biology, systems I studied are subjected to confinement down to nanometer scale, which is 10^-9 meter.

I am currently a Postdoc at Stanford University in California, USA. I work on theory and simulations of advanced electrolytes or polymer electrolytes for next generation batteries.
