Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Yuri and I am a PhD candidate in Decision, Risk and Operations at Columbia University, where I have the pleasure to be advised by Professor Omar Besbes and co-advised by Professor Ilan Lobel from NYU-Stern. I am interested in online optimization, decision-making problems and learning in complex environments such as online platform and marketplaces. I am also passioned about entrepreneurship.
