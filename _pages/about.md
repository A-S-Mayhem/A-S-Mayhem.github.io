Hello, I'm Amirali Soltani Tehrani, a passionate MSc student specializing in Control Engineering at the University of Tehran, Iran. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Systems, also earned at the University of Tehran. I'm currently an active member of the Graduate Lab at the Brain Computing Laboratory, where my enthusiasm for exploring the intersection of technology and neuroscience thrives. My academic journey has led me to delve deep into the realms of system neuroscience, signal processing, deep learning, statistics, and various machine learning methods. During my undergraduate years, I embarked on an exciting project: the development of an eye-tracking system. It's incredibly rewarding to see that the system I created is still in use today, reflecting my commitment to crafting solutions with lasting impact. In my pursuit of knowledge, I am currently immersed in the world of modeling peripheral vision in rodents as part of my Master's thesis. This endeavor has allowed me to apply my skills and passion to further our understanding of the intricacies of vision and perception. I'm eagerly looking forward to continuing my academic journey in the field of computational neuroscience, where I can contribute to unraveling the mysteries of the brain and developing innovative solutions. Feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests or have any questions. Let's explore the fascinating world of science and technology together!
