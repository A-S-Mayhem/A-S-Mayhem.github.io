# Why are species arranged in the way we see today?  
  
This is the main question guiding all my research interests. I am currently trying to understand how biological interactions and environmental variables determine species distribution in a biogeographical scale.  
Open Science and Science Communication are important parts of my research routine. I am currently editing and writing for [Hipótese Nula](https://medium.com/hipótese-nula/) and [Nicho42](https://medium.com/nicho42/).
