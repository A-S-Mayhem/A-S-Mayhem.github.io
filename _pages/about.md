### Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Ashley! 

I am a lab manager at Dr. Maital Neta's [Cognitive Affective Neuroscience lab](https://psychology.unl.edu/can-lab/) at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. I got my BSA in Neuroscience with an Evidence and Inquiry certificate at the University of Texas at Austin and completed a thesis that investigated the effect of social rejection on memory processes, supervised by [Dr. Alison Preston](https://clm.utexas.edu/preston/) and [Dr. Jennifer Beer](https://sites.google.com/site/utselfregulationlab/welcome-to-dr-jennifer-beers-self-regulation-lab-at-the-university-of-texas-at-austin). At UT, I was also an undergraduate teaching assistant for three years in four different courses. 

My research interests lie in social connection, emotion perception and regulation, interpersonal and intergroup conflict, applying psychological interventions to solve real-life issues, and creatively using new statistical methods to investigate these interests. Right now, I'm learning how to analyze data. Specifically fMRI data using multivariate pattern analysis and representational similarity analysis, and social networking data using RSiena. I'm also a HUGE fan of open science and spreading knowledge. 

You can find more information about my [research](research.md), or my [CV](CV.md) on this website.
