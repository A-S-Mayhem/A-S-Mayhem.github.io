I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Milan, working on the project *VIPoP — The Visual Politics of Populism* (PRIN 2023–2025). My research focuses on how parties and leaders strategically use different modes of political communication—both visual and textual—in response to varying incentives. I rely on computational methods, combining text-as-data, computer vision, and embedding models to study communication across modalities.

A second strand of my work applies computational tools to the study of legislative politics in the European Union. I focus on how laws are designed to structure executive discretion, and on developing scalable methods to measure delegating and constraining provisions across large corpora of legal texts.

Beyond these core areas, I have broader interests in the use of computational text analysis to explore media narratives, democratic rhetoric, and gender dynamics in political speech.

Before my current position, I completed my PhD in Political Science at [NASP](https://www.nasp.eu/training/phd-programmes/pols.html), a joint programme of the Department of Social and Political Sciences of the University of Milan, where I studied online campaigning and affective polarization during the 2019 European Parliament elections.
