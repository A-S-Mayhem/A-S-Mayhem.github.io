Hi! I am a second-year doctoral student in [School of Information](https://ischool.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I am advised by Drs. [Ahmer Arif](https://ahmerarif.com/), [Angela Smith](https://angeladrsmith.com/), and [Kenneth Fleischmann](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/people/people-details?PersonID=220). 

I have a background in data and learning sciences. My research interests are primarily focused on human-centered design and critical technical practice. I am currently studying how we might approach, understand, and respond to faith- and gender-based oppression in digital spaces and reimagine the design of digital spaces to encourage virtuous habits in online communities. In doing this work, I draw on theories of epistemic justice (Dr. Miranda Fricker), oppression (Dr. Kristie Dotson), resistance (Dr. José Medina), and decolonizing practices (Dr. Linda Tuhiwai Smith). 

I completed my B.Eng. in Information Technology from University of Mumbai, followed by M.S. in Data Science and M.Ed. in Learning Sciences with generous funding from [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) School of Education. At Indiana University, I have worked with and been mentored by Drs. [Rebecca Neri](https://ucla.academia.edu/RebeccaNeri), [Norman Su](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~normsu/), and [Phoebe Wakhungu](https://education.indiana.edu/about/directory/profiles/wakhungu-phoebe.html) on amazing projects in education and accessibility. 


Below is an up-to-date list of my co-authored publications.
