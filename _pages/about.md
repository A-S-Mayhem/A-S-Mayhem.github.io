Hi! I am Ananya Malik, an Undergraduate student from Mumbai India.

As a 4th year undergraduate student at Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, I fell in love with the subject. I found an intitial interest in Theoretical Computer Science. I worked as a Web Developer for DJ Unicode and have contributed to their website. I began working on Machine Learning with Andrew Ng's course on Coursera, then took a deep dive into Deep Learning and Computer Vision and have been invovlved in various projects and groups throughout college.

Currently, I am a Master's applicant for Fall 2021. This portfolio displays few of my recent projects. I am interested in continuing my work in Deep Learning, Vision and Language. I have also been working in Interpretable AI and Explainable AI, which I plan to pursue as a major subject.
