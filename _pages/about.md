I am a third-year undergraduate student of computer science at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/), the University of Melbourne, Australia. 

I will be working as a summer scholar at the [Computational Media Lab](http://cm.cecs.anu.edu.au/), the Australian National University. My supervisor is Prof. [Lexing Xie](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/).

Previously, I worked as an intern at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), the University of Sydney, under the supervision of Dr. [Nguyen Tran](https://nguyenhoangtran.github.io/).

During my undergraduate studies, I also worked with Dr. [Charl Ras](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/199833-charl-ras) at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/), the University of Melbourne.

I publish my papers under my official Vietnamese name, Tuan Dung Nguyen.
