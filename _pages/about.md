👨🏻‍💻 I’m a first year graduate student at San Jose State University.

🔬 My interests are in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Degree in Software Engineering, Specializing in Data Science.

📽️ Outside of coding and studying, I enjoy working out, hanging out with friends, and sipping on boba while exploring new spots around the city.
