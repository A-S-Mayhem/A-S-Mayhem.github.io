I am fascinated by geoscience and interested in the interactions between climate and tectonic processes that impact the habitability and sustainability of life. My research focuses on quantifying climate-tectonic interplay in shaping earth's surface and paleoenvironment using (1) dating techniques, such as thermochronology and optically stimulated luminescence; (2) remote sensing data; (3) multidisciplinary sedimentology, tectonics, and geomorphology approach; and (4) statistical and numerical modeling. I have worked on Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya (specifically in the Siang, Dibang, and Lohit river valleys), the Shillong plateau, and the Belt of Schuppen (especially in the southeastern boundary of Assam valley and the western part of Nagaland).
