I am a computational and quantitative sociologist studying political scoiology, law and society, organizational behavior, social movements, social inequality, and demography. Currently I am a Sociology PhD candidate at the [University of Arizona](https://sociology.arizona.edu/). My ongoing book project focuses on shareholder activism that seeks to improve corporate political transparency and accountability in the United States after 2000. My work has been (will be) published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12419/full), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), International Journal of Comparative Sociology, and [American Journal of Sociology](https://jeremyefiel.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/fz_ajs_preprint.pdf).
