Hello! My name is Peh Jia Da, a recent graduate from Politeknik Mersing with a Diploma in Information Technology, specializing in Digital Technology with a focus on Information Security. I have a strong passion for exploring new technologies and continuously seek to innovate and challenge the status quo.

Throughout my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to lead and participate in various competitive events, including serving as the captain for Team Bømbåstïç S¡dë £¥€ in the CRAC'23 competition, where we emerged as champions. Additionally, I have experience in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and developing AR applications, as showcased in my final year project at Politeknik Mersing.
