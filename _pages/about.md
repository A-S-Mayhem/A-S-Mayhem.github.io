This is the personal website of Pietro Belloni, PhD Student at the Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Padua (Italy).

My research is about medical statistics and epidemiology, especially applied to drug safety and cancer data. I also have fun with projects about data science, data mining, and natural language processing.
