With more than 3 years of experience on Bioelectronics and Medical Devices, I commit myself to the development of human technology in the field of bioelectronics, medical devices, aerospace and specially, the application of signal processing techniques and evolution of modern electronics. 

I started my academic life at the University of Malaga, Spain, where I studied Biomedical Engineering, specialized in bioelectronics. I created a solid background on physiology, anatomy, electromagnetic compatibility for medical devices, EMC regulation, analogue and digital electronics design and mechanical design. During my bachelor, Iwas granted with an international scholarship program to study at Incheon National University(INU) at South Korea where I improved my skills on brain engineering, nanodevice engineering and quantum analysis for nanoscience and nanoscale analysis. 

In January 2020 I graduated from the University of Glasgow with a first-class honors in the program of master in Mechatronics. There, I worked as a research assistant in the Microelectronics Laboratory(MeLab) at University of Glasgow, where I contributed to the European Project HERMES (FET-Proact). I designed and fabricated a brain implantable device for treating epilepsy. 

I began my PhD in September 2020 at the National Centre of Microelectronics of Seville, in Spain, as part of The Group of Neuromorphic Systems, under the supervision of Dr Teresa Serrano-Gotarredona and Bernabe Linares Barranco. My project falls under the research of algorithms, circuits and adaptative systems to be integrated on biological tissue and detection, analysis and pattern detection of epilepsy seizures. In parallel, I work for Analog Devices Inc. as a Firmware Developer and Test Engineer in the Medical Products team under the Digital Healthcare Division. My responsabilities here are: firmware development in RTOS for the nrf52840 microcontroller for an ECG device. I also develop unit tests, regression and load tests for continuous integration and continuous development. 

My biggest strength is to quickly adapt to new scenarios and environments. I am a fast-paced and constant learner. Every day gives a new lesson and I try to both, learn and teach. My academic experience has strengthened my communication skills, not only for presentation but for logical conversation, debates and solutions to conflicts. I have been an international reviewer for more than three years in IEEE international conferences and published in international journals. On my industrial side, I have demonstrated skills in task management, programming skills (C++/Python), electronics design (Eagle/KiCad/Altium), signal processing, systems engineering architecture, microelectronics (VHDL/Verilog), and fabrication of implantable devices for electric stimulation.
