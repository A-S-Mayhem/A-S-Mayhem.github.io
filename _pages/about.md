Hi!
===

<img align="right" src="https://cseveren.github.io/images/IMG_1214.jpeg" alt="Photo" style="width: 210px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 8px 8px 8px 8px"/>
I'm a graduate student in economics at UC San Diego. My current reseach interests are in education and consumer finance.

Before graduate school, I was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia where I worked with [Andrew Hertzberg](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/our-people/andrew-hertzberg) and [Igor Livshits](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/our-people/igor-livshits).
