I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Neurology](https://hms.harvard.edu/departments/neurology) at [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/)(MGH) and [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/)(HMS). I am a member of the [MIND Data Science Lab](https://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/research/mind-data-science-lab) at MGH/HMS and a [REC](https://www.madrc.org/about/research-education-component-rec/) scholar of the [Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center](https://www.madrc.org/) (MADRC). I primarily work with [Prof. Sudeshna Das](https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/11948449/Sudeshna-Das) to understand different stages of dementia from multimodal data (e.g., electronic health record, MRI, blood plasma, etc.) using deep learning methods (e.g., Natural Language Processing). I also work with [Prof. Deborah Blacker](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/deborah-blacker/) to conduct epidemiology studies in patients with dementia.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences with a Concentration in Cognitive Neuroscience from the [Department of Cognitive Sciences](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/) at the University of California Irvine. I was a member of the [Spatial Neuroscience Lab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/lab-members/). My Ph.D. advisor is [Prof. Elizabeth R. Chrastil](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/). During my gradute years, I studied [human navigation and spatial cognition](https://lilianyou.github.io/portfolio/). I also worked with [Prof. Jeffrey Krichmar](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~jkrichma/) on computational neuroscience modeling. Prior to this, I received my M.S. in Cognitive Neuroscience from the [University of California Irvine](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/), M.A. in Geography from [the University of California Santa Barbara](https://geog.ucsb.edu/), and B.S. in Psychology from [South China Normal University](http://psy.scnu.edu.cn/english/). My transdisciplinary background enables me to think about research questions across different scales.

Outside of research, I am a science communication advocator. While at UCI, I was the co-chair of the adult outreach committee of the [UCI Center for Neurobiology of Learning and Memory Ambassador Program](https://cnlm.uci.edu/ambassadors/) where I promoted events to help people in the Irvine community to learn more about neuroscience. During my years at UCSB, I was a member of geography outreach committee where I displayed augment reality sandbox during departmental outreach events to a various of audience. I am also passionate about data science. During graduate school, I was a [data science project instructor](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/you-lilian-cheng) at Coursera teaching interactive and fun guided projects to global learners. 

I go by Lily :)
