Hello!

Welcome to my website. 

My academic interests are in development economics, econometrics, and environmental economics. As an applied microeconomist, I rigorously approach data collection, analysis, and policy recommendations with a strong foundation in causal inference.  My current research addresses cattle health and production challenges in Kenya, aiming to improve human nutrition and economic well-being using framed field experiments and impact evaluation methods. However, my research also addresses sustainability, covering quality quantity issues in common pool resources. I believe in implementing evidence-based strategies and engaging in long-term planning to meet the evolving needs of vulnerable communities.

As a Ph.D. candidate at Washington State University, I have independently taught courses in Intermediate Macroeconomics and the  Economics of Sports in America. My teaching experience spans both online and in-person formats.
