I am an Ezra Systems Postdoctoral Associate in Systems Engineering at Cornell University working with Professor [Oliver Gao](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/h-oliver-gao). My research lies on systems of **renewable energy** and **sustainable transportation** with artificial intelligence.

I received my Ph.D. in Transportation System Engineering at [University of Illinois Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jane Lin](https://cme.uic.edu/profiles/jlin/). During my Ph.D., I also spent time at [Northwestern Universtiy](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in Chicago Metropolitan Exchange Program, working with Prof. [Marco Nie](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/nie-yu.html). I started my Ph.D. at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), working with Prof. [Subhonmesh Bose](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/boses) and Prof. [Lav Varshney](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/varshney). I obtained my M.S. in Transportation System Engineering at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I was advised by Prof. [Michael Cassidy](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/cassidy). I was also a Research Development Software Engineer at [California PATH](https://its.berkeley.edu/research-centers/path), working with Dr. [Xiao-Yun Lu](https://its.berkeley.edu/people/xiao-yun-lu). I obtained my B.S. in Civil Engineering at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/) and a Minor Degree in Finance at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).
