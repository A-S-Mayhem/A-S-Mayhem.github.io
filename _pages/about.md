:wave: Hello! My name is Nandan Thakur (नंदन ठाकुर / নন্দন ঠাকুর) [[CV]](https://thakur-nandan.github.io/files/Nandan_Thakur_CV_latest.pdf).

I'm currently a ~~(second)~~ third-year PhD student in the [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo in Canada, advised by [Prof. Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/). My research is supported by the [David R. Cheriton Graduate Scholarship](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current-graduate-students/funding-and-awards/david-r-cheriton-graduate-scholarship) (2024).

My research is on "Heterogeneous benchmarking of Retrieval and RAG systems across diverse domains and languages". I developed the [BEIR benchmark](http://beir.io) in 2021, which has become an industry standard for measuring model generalization. I've been fortunate to be a part of [MIRACL](http://miracl.ai), [SWIM-IR](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/swim-ir) and similar datasets. Recently, I have been working on better evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where I am co-hosting the first ever RAG competition in TREC 2024: [TREC 2024 RAG](https://trec-rag.github.io).
During my PhD, I've been involved in many research collaborations, including [SnowFlake AI](https://www.snowflake.com/en/), [Vectara](https://vectara.com/) and [Huawei](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/). I've also been fortunate to intern at [Google Research](https://research.google/). 


Before my PhD, I was a research assistant at the [UKP Lab (TU Darmstadt)](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) in Germany, supervised by Prof. [Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp) and [Nils Reimers](https://www.nils-reimers.de/) (2019 - 2021). I received my undergraduate degree at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani)](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2018. I also have industrial experience, working as a Data Scientist in [KNOLSKAPE](https://knolskape.com/) (2018 - 2019) and undergraduate internships at [EMBL Heidelberg](https://www.embl.org/sites/heidelberg/) (Summer 2018) and [Belong.co](https://belong.co/) (Fall & Winter 2017).
