## About Me

Hello! I’m Maitrayee Ghosh — a physical chemist (theory) with a passion for exploring matter under extreme pressure and temperature conditions. I earned my Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Rochester, and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the High Energy Density Sciences group at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University.

My work focuses on understanding the chemical behavior and structural evolution of hydrocarbons, planetary materials, and complex condensed matter systems in regimes relevant to planetary interiors and inertial fusion energy. To do this, I rigorously use **ab initio molecular dynamics (DFT-MD)**, machine-learned force fields, and structure search techniques.

I am especially interested in:

- Designing and discovering **novel materials** at extreme conditions  
- Extending simulations into the **Beyond Born–Oppenheimer** regime to study excited-state and non-adiabatic phenomena  
- Bridging **quantum simulations and machine learning** to unlock scalable, accurate modeling of high-energy-density systems  

Beyond science, I enjoy exploring the intersections of chemistry and storytelling — through poetry, photography, and visual media.
