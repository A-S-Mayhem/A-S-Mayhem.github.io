I am a university student of the ninth cycle of the Economics career at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP). Currently, I'm doing my pre-professional internship as a Research Assistant at the PUCP's Experimental Economics Laboratory (LEEX - PUCP). I have interests in behavioral economics, data science and inferential statistics.



Handbook of Applied Experimental Economics

I am collaborating in the writing of a manual book together with the LEEX team that will be published in the month of July. Specifically, collaborate on the following content: a lab experiment on rational expectations, programming experiments with oTree, and a tutorial on the programming language: Python.


Experimental economics workshop
------
In July, together with the LEEX PUCP team, we are preparing an experimental economics workshop with the main topics covered in the manual, such as the concept, design and deployment of an experiment on the web.
