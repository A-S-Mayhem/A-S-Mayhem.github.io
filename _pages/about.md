I am a first-year PhD student at Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, supervised by [Dr. Le Xie](https://xiele00.github.io/). I received my master's degree under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Gao](https://yang-gao.weebly.com/) at [Institute of Interdisciplinary Information Science](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I got my bachelor's degree at Department of Electrical Engineering, working with Prof. Qirong Jiang and Prof. Haiwang Zhong. Before entering TAMU, I spent a year as a research assistant at THU-EVAR lead by [Prof. Yang Gao](https://yang-gao.weebly.com/). My research interests concentrate on deep reinforcement learning, safe control, foundation models, and intersections with power systems and robotics. Low-carbon smart grids can help reduce carbon emissions, mitigate climate changes, and achieve sustainable development. Embodied intelligence helps to liberate productivity, keeping humans away from dangerous work and labor exploitation. My ultimate goal is to create a harmonious world with advanced AI technologies, whether between people or humans and nature.
