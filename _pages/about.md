I am a third year PhD candidate in [biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at Harvard University. [My research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iZnTmxMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) focuses on developing new statistical methods to leverage **real world data** to improve decision-making in public health and clinical medicine. Specifically, my academic interests include robust and efficient estimation and inference using **large-scale data** generated from electronic health records and clinical trial data. I'm lucky to be mentored by [Professor Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/).

My current research goals include:
* Developing doubly robust estimators for validating surrogate markers in observational data. 
* Producing semi-supervised transfer learning methods to improve the efficiency of pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time-to-event and is captured using imperfect surrogates in electronic health records.
* Creating communication-efficient, distributed learning algorithms that robustly estimate treatment effects in target populations under privacy constraints and heterogeneous sites.
* Designing a principled approach for sensitivity analysis of design parameters in the evaluation of competing clinical trial designs.

I enjoy playing golf, rooting for my alma mater (UNC Tar Heels!), reading history, and staying up-to-date with global affairs.
