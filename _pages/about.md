About Me
======

I am a first year PhD student in Statistics at Baylor University. I graduated in 2021 from Brigham Young University with a B.S. in Statistical Science and a minor in mathematics.

While at BYU, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant for a year working on Bayesian models for estimating elemental profiles of potential pollution source profiles and their contributions at various locations. See our publication [here](https://trgrimm.github.io/publications/).

As part of my duties as a graduate assistant at Baylor, I:

* Assisted in the development of a multi-day data science workshop for professionals in the water/wastewater treatment industry.
* Currently work as a statistical consultant studying and applying various statistical methods to help clients understand their data on a case-by-case basis.
