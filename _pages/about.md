 I am a research fellow at Stanford (Rock Center and Olin Program in Law and Economics). My research focuses on the application of behavioral insights to competition policy, corporate governance, economic regulation, and the empirical analysis of law and its policy implications. I am trained in law, economic theory, econometrics, and behavioral science.
 I was born in Chile, where I lived until 2015. I studied my undergrad in law and social sciences there, and my grad studies at Harvard and Stanford. am qualified to practice as a barrister in Chile, where I worked for the Chilean antitrust authority. I have taught seminars on antitrust and law and economics at Universidad de Chile and Econ 154 (Law and Economics) at the Stanford Department of Economics. Before coming to Stanford, I worked as a competition expert for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), conducting a competition assessment of the pharmaceutical sector in Mexico.
