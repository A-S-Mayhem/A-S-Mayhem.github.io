I am Khanh, a Lecturer at [Department of Probability and Statistics](https://sites.google.com/hcmus.edu.vn/math-xstk/), [Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science,](https://math.hcmus.edu.vn/en/) University of Science, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh city. 
<br><br>
I received my Bachelor's degree in Oct 2012, after finishing four years of honors program at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Science, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh city. I graduated top of my class and I did research on mathematical analysis and statistics. After graduating, I was offered a teaching assistant position at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science. During this period, I was fascinated by applications of Statistics in life science. This had motivated me to become a researcher in applied statistics. In 2014, I was selected as a Ph.D. student in Statistics at [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/) with the first rank in the ranking table of CARIPARO Ph.D. scholarship at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/), Italy. During three years of my Ph.D. program, I was working hard on the subject "Statistical evaluation of diagnostic tests under verification bias" which is an interested topic in Medical Statistics. I defended my doctoral dissertation in March 2017, and received great appreciation from the committee. The full text of my Ph.D thesis can be found [here](https://hdl.handle.net/11577/3425717). In addition, I successful developed an R package (named bcROCsurface) and a web interface to support researchers in the evaluation of predictive ability of diagnostic tests. For these results, I was awarded the Prize for Research 2017 of Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Padova.
<br><br>
From May 2017 to June 2022, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the department and studied on the several research projects with regard to te problem of evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic test (or biomarker, or classifier in general) and meta-analysis. The details of all projects can be found in [my CV](/cv/) page. Working on these projects, I gained valuable experience in data analysis for biomedical data and gene expression data, especially for incurable diseases, such as epithelial ovarian cancer, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, breast cancer. I have accumulated valuable experiences on modeling the model for missing data mechanism and on mixed-effect models, moreover I improved my coding skill in R and C/C++ programming. Last but not least, I understood the important role of diagnostic tests or screening tests (or biomarkers) for early detecting serious diseases, e.g., ovarian cancer, breast cancer and diabetes. These trigger my further research activities in biomedical statistics with regard to evaluating diagnostic tests (screening tests) and cancer research.

Besides doing research, I am also interested in teaching statistics. I am constantly improving my teaching skills to provide the best experience for students of not only statistics but also other majors, for example, biology, medicine, economics, geology.

The last but not least, I am a  an amateur photographer. I like to create photos of natural landscapes or buildings with striking architecture. Soon, I will be sharing my photos on this page.
