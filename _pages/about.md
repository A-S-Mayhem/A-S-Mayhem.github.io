TLike to get to know you but I don't have time

Driving 'round the city like I lost my mind

Try'n to find a taxi try'n to get back home

Got to find a minute just to be alone

Wish that I could call you but I'm always gone

Had to leave a message 'cause it takes too long

Hope it doesn't matter hope you'll understand

Got too much to do you know I can't make plans

Can you believe

I have to leave

We've got to find some time to get together

How's never

How's never

How's never

Seven came eleven came the pouring rain

All I want to do is

Someone calls my name but I'm too tired to speak

Maybe things will come down in another week

Can you believe

I have to leave

We've got to find some time to get together

How's never

How's never

How's never
