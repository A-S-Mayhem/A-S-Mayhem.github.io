Welcome to Craig Toth's Personal Portfolio.

I am currently working on a Master of Library and Information Studies at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I am specializing in digital libraries, instructional design, and information architecture, with the goal of making information easy to access and learn for a broad audience.

My experience as a teaching professional began when I developed the Polk County (Florida) School Board website. Following this, I served as aÂ technology teacher and school network manager. My responsibilities in these positions included overseeing a large school network, training teachers and staff, and developing a technology plan and budget.

I currently serve as pastor of New Mount Vernon United Methodist Church in Winston Salem, NC, where I teach church members using scripture, historic examples, and contemporary sources. I have served as a pastor in the Western North Carolina Conference since I graduated from Duke Divinity School in 2008.
