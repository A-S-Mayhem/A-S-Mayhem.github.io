ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm William Drew

What I'm interested in
======

Iâ€™m interested in the intersection between medicine and computer science by advancing neuroscience research with computer science. In particular, I'm investigating ways to use machine learning to expand our understanding of brain networks.

What I'm working on
======

I'm currently working as a data analyst at the [Center for Brain Circuit Therpeutics](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/neurosciences-center/center-for-brain-circuit-therapeutics) at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/).

At the center, I'm in charge of the Center's computational infrastructure and computational methods development. In addition to supporting research at the Center, I am also investigating new ways to think about lesion network mapping and other types of functional connectivity analyses. In particular, I am developing a set of new tools involving what I call the Precomputed Functional Connectome, a high-resolution voxel-wise atlas of functional connectivity in the brain. Check out what I'm working on [here](https://github.com/thewilliamdrew/pfc-toolkit).
