I am a permanent **CNRS Research Scientist** in the **Biophysics of Complex Systems** team at Institut des Sciences Analytiques, France. My research falls under **computational molecular biophysics**, **physical chemistry**, and **integrative structural biology**.
I strive to understand how **biomolecular function** emerges from **structural dynamics** by describing the **atomically-detailed mechanisms** involved. For this, I combine **molecular dynamics simulations**, **machine learning**, and **experimental biophysics**. 
Leaning on my expertise in **free energy calculations**, I have elucidated **complex molecular mechanisms** in systems ranging from short peptides, to large **molecular motors** (myosin, ATP synthase). I also contributed to early characterizations of the conformational dynamics and 
immunogenic sites of the **SARS-CoV-2 spike protein**. I am now interested in **pushing the frontiers** of integrative structural biophysics with machine learning approaches.
