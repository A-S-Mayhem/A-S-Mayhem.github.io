## About Me
Hi, I'm __Nandan Thakur (नंदन ठाकुर / নন্দন ঠাকুর)__ [\[CV\]]().  
I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) in [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I have been fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/). Before, I was a research assistant at the [UKP Lab, Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp), Germany. I graduated with B.E. (Hons.) in Electronics and Instrumentation from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India in 2018. 


My research interests lie within NLP and Information Retrieval. I am particularly interested in how we can build __simple and scalable efficient systems which can improve the neural search paradigm__.  My long-term research ambition lies in building robust and generalizable retrieval models to help serve information better for everyone. Few of my top publications include the __BEIR Benchmark__ [(Thakur et al., NeurIPS 2021)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wCu6T5xFjeJ), __Augmented SBERT__ [(Thakur et al., NAACL 2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.28/), __GPL__ [(Wang et al., NAACL 2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.168/) and __MIRACL__ [(Zhang and Thakur et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09984). 

I have had an interesting background [story]() leading to achieving my interests towards open-source projects and research in NLP and IR. To help the research community, I am willing to mentor a few undergraduate / master students interested towards my direction. Personally, I encourage __students with diverse backgrounds__ to reach out. 

## News
- 2022/09: The MIRACL Challenge was accepted in [WSDM Cup 2023](). The Challenge is now live and looking for participants. 
- 2022/08: I started my Fall Internship at the Language Team in [Google Research](https://research.google/teams/language/) with Daniel Cer and Jianmo Ni.
