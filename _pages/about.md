I am Ethan Landers, a computer science undergraduate senior studying with Old Dominion University's ODUGlobal.  I am enrolled in the ODU Computer Science Linked Program, where I can take four master's courses in my senior year of undergraduate studies.  I am also a part of the ODU Perry Honors College.

## Projects
I worked full-time alongside a Ph.D. professor and several graduate assistants at Old Dominion University on disinformation detection and analytics research funded by the National Science Foundation through their **Research Experience for Undergraduates** (REU) program for the summer of 2022. For the project, I developed a data set to test COVID-19 scientific claim verification models' accuracy in detecting disinformation.

For the spring of 2023, I participated in an experiential learning opportunity through Old Dominion University called **Innovate Cyber**.  Through it, I utilized design thinking to create a cyber hygiene prototype regarding integrating cyber hygiene learning into Virginia K-12 computer classes.  I collaborated with peers over three months to develop and eventually pitch this prototype via ZOOM to a panel of cybersecurity and computer science university faculty, cyber and computing industry professionals, and university administrators.

I participated in a program through a partnership with Old Dominion University and NASA called **NASA@MyLibrary**, where I coordinated with libraries across the United States to create and host STEM educational programs via Zoom for their audiences to meet their individual needs.  Some topics I taught were the James Webb Space Telescope, Python programming language, and what a computer science degree entails.

## Awards
Since my enrollment at Old Dominion University, I have earned three scholarship awards: the **Cranmer-Skinner Honors Scholarship** in 2023, the **Richard T. and Nancy P. Cheng Award in Computer Science** in 2022, and the **Old Dominion University Presidential Scholarship** in 2020.
