I use numerical methods to understand geodynamic processes within the solid Earth across different temporal and spatial scales. I have built subduction frameworks to understand the tectonic and rheological origin of extensional structures, e.g., rifting, opening, and spreading seafloor, developed within the overriding plate. [These numerical models](https://zhibinlei.github.io/research/) investigate - but are not restricted to - the role of high trench retreat rate, multiple slab subduction (dual inward dipping subdution), and inherited lateral lithospheric heterogeneities, in governing the strain localisation (plate weakening processes) within the overriding plate during subduction. A synoptic summary of these findings can be found in [my PhD thesis](https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/152759/1/2022leizphd.pdf) (Figure 6.2).
