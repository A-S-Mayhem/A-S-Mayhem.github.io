I'm a third year undergraduate student from Department of Software Engineering, [Shanghai University Of Electric Power]. My research interest includes distributed OS engineering, fundamental of compling, discrete mathematics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaojing Zhu] from [School of Informatics], Kyoto University. Currently, I minored in computational science, interested in Discrete Optimization.

If you are also interested in OS engineering or machine learning, contact with me [E-mail: tomlay0520@mail.shiep.edu.cn].And I am looking forward to cooperating with u.
