I am currently a Ph.D. student at Fudan University, working under the guidance of Professor Jun Wu and Associate Professor [Hui Xu](https://hxuhack.github.io/). My recent research focuses on vulnerability detection in Rust libraries, primarily guided by Hui Xu. I am keen to explore various techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities in Rust libraries to enhance the reliability of the Rust ecosystem. Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree from South China University of Technology, where I actively participated in competitive programming and was awarded two silver medals in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).

- [RuMono](https://github.com/Artisan-Lab/RULF/tree/RuMono): RuMono aims to automatically synthesize fuzz drivers for every API in your Rust library. RuMono can synthesize valid and comprehensive fuzz drivers by inferring suitable concrete types for generic APIs and synthesize every implementation for generic APIs.
