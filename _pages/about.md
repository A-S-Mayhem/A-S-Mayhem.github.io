### About Me

I am currently a fourth year PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I work with [Alex Endert](http://va.gatech.edu/endert/). My current research focuses on the design of interaction techniques for visualization construction and visual data exploration. I am also interested in conducting experiments as a method to understand how visualizations can be used to support data analysis. Priror to joining Georgia Tech, I had the opportunity to work with some amazing people at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), [CNS Research Center](https://cns.iu.edu/), and [NUS-HCI Lab](http://www.nus-hci.org/).
