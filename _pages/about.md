I am a 4th year PhD candidate in the [Economics Department at University of California San Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu). Prior to UC San Diego I did Master's in Economics at Central European University.


My research interests are in experimental and behavioral economics with a focus on social learning, misspecified models and discrimination. I also work on topics related to student mental health and peer group support for online tutors.
