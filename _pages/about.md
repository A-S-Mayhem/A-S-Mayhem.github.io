Research Interests
======
My current interests lie in statistical machine learning and computational data science with an emphasis on explainability and responsibility. I am most interested in applying these tools to model, better understand, and improve environmental and social systems.

Current and Recent Projects
======
### Algorithmic Analysis of Predictive Policing Algorithms
*Yale Computer Science Department, September 2022-Present*

Investigating impacts of algorithmic policing on city communities


### Interpretable Machine Learning and Amazonian Deforestation

*Yale School of the Environment, January 2022-Present*
