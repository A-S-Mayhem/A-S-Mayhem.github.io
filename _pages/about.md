I am transitioning my [website](https://www.scottraulerson.com/) from Google Sites over to Github. This transition is a side project I really only work on when I am tired of dissertating. Bare with me as I build it out.

Hopefully will be able to host much more on this platform than Google Sites (very restrictive). The idea is to be able to host models, data, etc. on this website.

My background
======
I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate within the Warnell School of Forestry & Natural Resources at the University of Georgia. I received my M.S. in Geosciences with a focus on Water Sciences/Hydrology from Georgia State University in 2018, and my bachelors degree in Environmental Science with a minor in Geology from Georgia College & State University (now Georgia College) in 2016.
