I am Vasudha Varadarajan, a fourth year PhD student working in the areas of natural language processing and the relationships between cognition and language, especially in the context of social media. I work with Prof. H. Andrew Schwartz in the State University of New York at Stony Brook. I am 
interested in applying NLP/data science techniques to problems in computational social science to study social/psychological phenomena through language use at scale, active learning, and improving conversational AI for psychometric surveys. I am also interested in interpretability and explainability of language models, and exploring NLP for low-resource and code-mixed settings.

I am always looking for opportunities (currently internships) to work with teams with similar interests- preferably with a research component. 
Other than that, I have been trying to improve my science communication skills, and I love facilitating discussions and teaching!
