<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
My name is Yuke Wang, a second-year Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu">computer science</a> at University of California, Santa Barbara (<a href="https://ucsb.edu">UCSB</a>). Before I come to UCSB, I got my B.E. in software engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China <a href="http://en.uestc.edu.cn/">UESTC</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
At UCSB, I am working with Prof <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yufeiding/">Yufei Ding</a>. I have been working on projects in software-hardware co-design for distance-related algorithms, such as KNN, KMeans. I am also interested in deep learning, especially graph neural network (GNN) optimization and acceleration on heterogeneous platforms, such as GPUs.</p>
