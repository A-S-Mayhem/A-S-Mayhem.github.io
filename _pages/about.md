I am an undergraduate at UC San Diego with hopes to pursue a role in SWE. I am double majoring in Math and Computer Science and minoring in Classical Studies. I am a member of [The Computing for Social Good Lab at UCSD](https://melsherief.eng.ucsd.edu/research) where I am researching mental burnout and problem gambling on social media using NLP.

I am currently looking for a 2023 internship positions as a software engineer. Please check my [resume](https://godsped.com/cv) for links to my past experiences.

## Interests

I am interested in investigating the applications machine learning techniques and its intersection with various fields, particularly NLP. I see computers' knowledge of human language as the next big interface for humans to utilize computing power more naturally. I look forward to computers gaining a semantic understanding of language.
I am also passionate about the application of simulation in developing robust systems. I am currently looking into using Unity simulations to accelerate software development on aerial vehicles. Simulations can be integrated into automated testing pipelines and used for human sanity-check verification during rapid development cycles.
