## Currently

I am a PhD Candidate in the Quake lab at Stanford. We aim to develop new technological and analytical approaches that solve problems of scientific and medical interest.

During my PhD, I've  been focused on  modeling the dynamics of the immune system. In particular, I have been using single-cell sequencing technologies paired with  machine learning / data science to understand cell fate decisions of human immune cells _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. Ultimately, detailed models of the immune system should allow us create synthetic immune cells which will solve an array of problems in human health including cancer, aging, and auto-immune disease.
