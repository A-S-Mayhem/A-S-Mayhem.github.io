Welcome!  I am a Masters Student in Computer Science at New York University Courant. My research interests lie in the area of Applied ML, Predictive Analysis, and Data Science.

I was born and brought up in the capital city of India- Delhi. I have always been inquisitive by nature and it has helped me immensely in every walk of life. It fuels my creativity and makes me want to explore my environment to the fullest. I sing sometimes as well and follow cricket as a sport.
