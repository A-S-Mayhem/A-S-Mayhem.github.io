<p style="text-align: justify">As of March 1st 2025, I'm joining <a href="https://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~gear/">Georgios Arvanitidis</a>' team as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.compute.dtu.dk/sections/cogsys">Section for Cognitive Systems</a> (CogSys) at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). <br><br> 

I recently graduated from my Master's in <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/Human-Centered-Artificial-Intelligence">Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence</a> at DTU where I also obtained my Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/undergraduate/undergraduate-programmes-in-danish/bsc-eng-programmes/artificial-intelligence-and-data">Artificial Intelligence and Data</a>. During my studies I was also abroad as a visiting student at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a>. I have a strong background in machine learning and my Master's Thesis focused on leveraging concepts from differential geometry in optimization for improving generalization performance.</p>

My research interests
------
<p style="text-align: justify">I'm particularly interested in the theoretical aspects of machine learning and deep learning. Currently, I'm focusing on gaining further knowledge on:</p>

* differental geometry in machine learning 
* approximate Bayesian inference
* deep learning theory
<!-- * Probabilistic machine learning -->
<!-- * Explainability and interpretability of deep learning models -->

What is this site for? 
======

The purpose of this website is to give any interested reader an insight into the aspects of Machine Learning and Data Science that I've been working with. My main motivation has been to create a platform for me to experiment with writing [blog posts about my daily encounters with Data Science](https://albertkjoller.github.io/posts).  -->
