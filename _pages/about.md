Thanks for visiting!

I am a PhD (DPhil) candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.

My research interests are in development, labour, and behavioural economics. I use randomised and natural experiments to help answer policy questions. \
My current research studies firm and household behaviour in low-income rural settings.
