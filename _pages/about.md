I am a second-year master student in [Applied Mathematics and Computational Science](http://www.amcs.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania.
Gerenally, my research interests include statistical machine learning, high dimensional statistics and their applications in various areas like genomics, finance, public health, etc. 

This summer I was very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. J. Richard Landis](http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p7791) and [Prof. Wensheng Guo](http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p10796) at Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics in Perelman School of Medicine. We developed unsupervised learning methods to help doctors to group patients into subsets who share common symptom patterns. More detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/jialinyi94/FTSC).

Prior to UPenn, I spent four wonderful years at Wuhan University in China and graduated with double major in mathematics and economics.

Recently, I am applying for PhD programs in statistics.
