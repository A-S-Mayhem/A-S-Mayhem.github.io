excerpt: "About me"
---

I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. Prior to this, I have worked as a Data Scientist in IBM India Pvt. Ltd after completing my Masters in Control and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

During my stint in IBM, I have worked on some client-facing projects which involved deep learning applications in the domain of object detection and tracking of persons in video feed. I have also worked on NLP projects in my leisure hours. As a novice PhD student, I am presently learning the basics of Speech Processing and hope to contribute to the field of Speech Processing by means of Deep Learning.
