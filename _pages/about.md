Hi! I am Saray, a PhD candidate in the Autonomous Multi-robots lab at the department of Cognitive Robotics at TU Delft, the Netherlands. I am supervised by Javier Alonso-Mora and Wendelin Boehmer. My research is focused on social and intuitive motion planning for high-dimensional systems in multi-agent scenarios. I am analyzing scenarios where robots or robots and humans perform close-proximity tasks and therefore their 3D geometry and actions cannot be ignored.

I have obtained my bachelor degree and master degree at Eindhoven, University of Technology (NL) where I was part of the Control System Technology group, supervised by Elena Torta. 

## News
-**September 2023.** Our paper got accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on Multi-Robot and Multi-Agent Systems (MRS) in Boston 2023. 
- **October 2023.** Chech out the ArXiv paper "A Bayesian optimization framework for the automatic tuning of MPC-based shared controllers" of the CST group @TU/e. I contributed to this amazing project by developing the MPC framework during my master thesis.
