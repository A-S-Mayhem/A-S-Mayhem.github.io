# About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona.

I have  experience in language analysis with traditional and computational methods in group and individual projects. I have worked on English, Spanish, and Portuguese both for academia and industry. 
My research interests lay in the intersection between communication outcomes, theoretical linguistics, and big data.

I am currently working as a Graduate Assistant for the University of Arizona Libraries under the supervision of [Dr. Chun Ly](https://astrochun.github.io/) in DevOps, data curation, and outreach for the University of Arizona Libraries' [Research Data Repository (ReDATA)](https://data.library.arizona.edu/redata).

### My working philisophy

```python
def jump_higher():
    do = 'improv'
    now = 'e'
    recursively = 'ing
    print (f"{do + now} and keep {do + recursively}")

while True:
    jump_higher()
```
