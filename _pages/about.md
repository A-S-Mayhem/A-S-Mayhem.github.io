I am Ethan Landers, a senior at Old Dominion University majoring in computer science. I am also enrolled in Old Dominion University’s computer science-accelerated master’s program, expecting to graduate with my bachelor’s degree in the spring of 2024 and my master’s degree in the spring of 2025. As a member of the Old Dominion University Perry Honors College, I maintain an overall GPA of 3.94 and a departmental GPA of 3.93.

# Work Experience
I actively contributed to [**NASA@MyLibrary**](https://science.nasa.gov/sciact-team/nasa-at-my-library/), a program affiliated with NASA and Old Dominion University, from 2021 to 2023. In this role, I collaborated with peers and mentors to create and virtually present STEM educational programs for libraries nationwide. These programs covered diverse topics such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Python programming, and insights into pursuing a computer science degree, providing valuable learning experiences for young audiences with limited access to STEM education.

From January to April 2023, I participated in an experiential learning program called [**Innovate Cyber**](https://www.odu.edu/asis/innovatecyber) at Old Dominion University. Within a three-member team, I played a pivotal role in designing a [cyber hygiene prototype](https://sites.google.com/odu.edu/cyberhygieneprototype/home) aimed at integrating cybersecurity education into Virginia K-12 classes. Employing design thinking principles, I led the project and presented the finalized prototype to a diverse panel, including cybersecurity and computer science experts, university faculty, and administrators. The project showcased its potential impact on enhancing cybersecurity awareness in K-12 education across Virginia.

During the summer of 2022, I engaged in full-time research through Old Dominion University’s disinformation detection and analytics [**Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)**](https://www.odu.edu/academics/research-experiences/reu/cis) program, funded by the National Science Foundation. During this experience, I assessed the MultiVerS model, an automated system for scientific claim verification. My responsibilities included preprocessing data to generate an open-domain dataset, achieving a 75% consensus rate for independent labeling. Additionally, I played a key role in implementing and assessing the MultiVerS model with the newly created dataset. Through this process, I identified model limitations and provided valuable insights for future improvements in scientific claim verification systems. The culmination of this research effort resulted in my coauthorship for the findings, which were published in a publication titled [*MSVEC: A Multidomain Testing Dataset for Scientific Claim Verification*](https://reuns2023.hotcrp.com/paper/21?cap=hcav21iDTrHiRUNCxdztUQbDPKtQzA) in the 8th National Workshop for REU Research in Networking and Systems (REUNS 2023).

# Volunteer Experiences
In addition to my academic pursuits, I have actively contributed to the tech community and taken on leadership roles both at Old Dominion University and beyond. Currently, I have served as Vice President for the [**Association for Computing Machinery's Council on Women in Computing (ACMW)**](https://odu.campusgroups.com/acmw/home/) at Old Dominion University since August 2022. In this role, I collaborate with advisors to plan events and enhance student engagement in STEM fields, with a focus on advancing the contributions of technical women. I also maintain records of meeting and event proceedings for future reference.

Also, I have held the position of Co-Organizer for [**PySWFL**](https://www.meetup.com/pythonswfl/) since December 2023. Co-organizing with the founder, I plan Python-focused events for the Southwest Florida tech community. This role also involves creating and hosting in-person social events to facilitate networking and interaction among community members. Additionally, we are currently planning a monthly Python study group to delve into foundational knowledge and foster a collaborative learning environment. 

# Awards
I have earned three scholarship awards since my enrollment at Old Dominion University. These include the **Cranmer-Skinner Honors Scholarship** in 2023, the **Richard T. and Nancy P. Cheng Award in Computer Science** in 2022, and the **Old Dominion University Presidential Scholarship** in 2020.
