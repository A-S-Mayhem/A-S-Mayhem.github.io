Hello! I am a Lecturer and Research Data Services Specialist at the [RDS Department at Georgia State University](https://research.library.gsu.edu/dataservices). I am also part of the [Emerging Methodologists Workshop](https://sigla.georgetown.domains/emworkshop/participants/) 2024 cohort. I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Political Science at Georgia State University](https://politicalscience.gsu.edu/) in Atlanta, Georgia. I received my BA and MA from [Political Science and International Relations Department at Bogazici University](https://pols.boun.edu.tr/). My current research agenda focuses on political parties, opposition cooperation and coordination, and authoritarian regimes. 

My research has been published in the *Party Politics*, *Journal of Peace Research*, and *Journal of Civil Society*. My published and working papers can be found on my [publications page](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/publications/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q4RzaGMAAAAJ&hl=en). Access my most current CV [here](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/cv/).

My book project addresses the pre-electoral coalitions formed in electoral autocratic regimes. I use a mixed-methodological approach -- large-N quantitative analysis, causal case selection, and site-intensive methods -- to explore how political parties' organizational structures and ideological and political agenda diversity explain opposition bargaining prior to the elections. Based on my dissertation research, this book provides ethnographic insights and extensive knowledge on countries often neglected in case study approach, like Turkey, Hungary, and North Macedonia. My research on Turkey received the **Best Paper Award** at ISA-South, **Best Fieldwork Award – Honorable Mention** from APSA’s Democracy and Autocracy section, and got the **2nd place at 3MT** (The Three Minute Thesis) Competition at GSU. My book project has been supported by the [William A. Steiger Fund for Legislative Studies](https://connect.apsanet.org/centennialcenter/2022/09/01/pre-electoral-opposition-coalitions-in-authoritarian-regimes/) of the APSA Centennial Grant, Craigie Fellowship, and GSU's [Library Dissertation Award](https://graduate.gsu.edu/dissertation-library-travel-awards/). See details of my project [here](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/dissertation/).

I was the Chair of the [Atlanta Symposium on Political Science](https://sites.google.com/view/asops2023/home?authuser=0) (ASOPS). I also served as elected Ph.D. representative of my department's Diversity and Inclusion Committee. In my free time, I volunteer at [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) or I like to hike, cook, read, and play tennis or tabletop games.
