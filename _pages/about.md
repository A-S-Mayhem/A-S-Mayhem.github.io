I am a PhD candidate in School of Sociology at University of Arizona, mainly researching social movements, organizational behavior, and policy change. In my dissertation, I use statistical, network, and computational methods to study how social movements (i.e.ï¼Œshareholder and stakeholder activism) shape corporate political spending activities and related governance practices. Drawing on data from Center for Political Accountability, WebSraping (e.g., media reports) and other big administrative data, I attempt to address two sets of questions: 1) Why some companies are targeted by shareholder and stakeholder activism? 2) What are the consequenes of shareholder and stakeholder activism regarding corporate market values, investors' perceptions, federal contracts, and access to congression? I am also interested in family research and demography. My work appears in [Journal of Marriage and Family](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12419/full), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9) and [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001).
