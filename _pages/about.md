My name is Kunal Aneja, and I am an undergraduate student at the College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am majoring in computer science with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence. My academic interests are deeply rooted in advancing research in reinforcement learning and robotics, particularly how machine learning models can drive robotic decision-making. At Georgia Tech's People, AI, and Robotics (PAIR) Lab, I have had the opportunity to work on keypoint trajectory modeling, allowing robots to perform a variety of tasks without requiring explicit action annotationsâ€”a vital step towards creating more autonomous and adaptable robotic systems. In addition to my research work, I have developed a strong background in computer vision, with a focus on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), exploring how machines can better understand and interact with humans in dynamic environments. My academic pursuits are complemented by industry programming experience, where I have honed my technical skills, allowing me to bridge theory and practice effectively. Whether it's conducting research or applying innovative AI techniques to real-world problems, I am passionate about using my skills to drive impactful advancements in the field of AI and robotics.
