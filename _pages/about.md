Before I stumbled into technical writing, I worked as a Digital Forensics Investigator at a place called the Cyber Crimes Unit under the St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office. I acquired, parsed, and analyzed digital evidence from devices involved in active criminal cases—such as mobile phones or computers—and wrote forensic reports about my findings for detectives, prosecutors, and defense attorneys alike. It was a fascinating job to hold as somebody who was an undergraduate student, and sometimes, I felt like I was in an episode of *Law & Order*.

I've always loved reading and writing, so naturally, I studied English. In university, I read about dynamic worlds and textual lives, from Austen to Wilde to Baldwin. To this day, I find it hard to articulate why exactly I love reading and writing so much. If I had to give a definitive answer, I would say that it's because it allows me to learn about something that's outside of me, beyond my own perspective. 

If that's my definitive answer to why I love reading and writing so much, it makes sense that I found an affinity with technology. In tech, there's always a new trend. It can be overwhelming. Mass layoffs suddenly occur. There's uncertainty. Despite these things, I see myself working in the tech industry for a while—maybe even my whole life—as long it allows me to continue learning and growing. 

## My Interests
Outside of work, I love to travel (and scrapbook my travel adventures). I studied abroad at Trinity College Dublin in Dublin, Ireland during the spring of 2023, where I went all over both Ireland and Europe (my favorite cities were Prague, Amsterdam, and Edinburgh). My current travel bucket list consists of going to the national parks, Iceland, and South Korea.

I've also played indoor and beach volleyball for 14 years, and although I don't competitively play anymore, I always try to join casual leagues and intramural teams. On the side, I love to run. I ran my first half marathon during my last semester of university, and I hope to run my first marathon next year.

Lastly, I've always been a creative writer. I wrote stories on the school bus in sixth grade, and although fiction writing is something I've lost touch with during university, I know I'll be disappointing my younger self if I never try to publish my own novel. I love reading and writing anything, from mystery thriller to fantasy to literary.
