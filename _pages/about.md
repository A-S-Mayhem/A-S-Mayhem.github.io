* I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xia (Ben) Hu](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html). 

* Previously, I received the M.S. degree from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) under supervision of [Prof. Chen Gong](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cgong821/) and Prof. Zhengyuan Xu in optical wireless communication and networking center.

* Previously, I received the B.S. degree from [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) majoring in Electronic Information Engineering.

* My research interests lie in the broad area of trustworthy machine learning, particularly in fair and robust DNNs and GNNs. I am also interested in advertisement bid optimization.

**Oct. 2021:** Submit two papers, one is on learning with instance-dependent label noise, the other is on group fairness with continuous sensitive attributes.

**Sep. 2021:** Submit the paper on Risk-Aware Bid Optimization for advertisement display. â€“ We propose a risk-aware bid optimization framework in Real-Time Bidding (RTB) with nice Value at Risk (VaR) therectical support. Additionally, we develop two  instantiations to model risk tendency, including an expert knowledge based formulation embracing three essential properties and an adaptive learning method based on self-supervised reinforcement learning.

**May. 2020:** Thrilled to start my summer internship at Samsung Research America Ads AI team, supervised by [Dr. Li Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FPcI7HkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Rui Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ngVttWUAAAAJ&hl=en).
