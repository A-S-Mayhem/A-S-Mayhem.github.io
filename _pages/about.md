I'm a second-year graduate student of software engineering at Sun Yat-sen University. I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Jiajing Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EaqeskUAAAAJ&hl=en) at [InPlusLab](https://inpluslab.com/) where [Prof. Zibin Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zWnsNrkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) is lab manager. 

My academic interests center around blockchain security. 区块链生态X poses a fascinating challenge in XXX. My primary focus is on XXX. In my research, I strive to XXX. Additionally, I am actively exploring XXX. I also make efforts to XXX.

In addition to doing research, I also enjoy doing sports and travelling.

I'm looking for a research assistant position to seek more challenging researches on blockchain security. I am excited about the opportunities for collaboration and advancement in my field, and am eager to continue learning and contributing to the research community. If you are willing to learn more about my research or explore potential opportunities for collaboration, I would be honored if you could kindly reach out to me. Thank you for visiting!
