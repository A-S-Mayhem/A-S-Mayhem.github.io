I'm a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley and a Research Associate at the [Center on the Politics of Development](https://cpd.berkeley.edu/). 

Prior to Berkeley, I was a Fulbright-Nehru Research Fellow and Lombard Fellow at the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics in Pune, India. I also worked for the Women’s Economic Empowerment Unit at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., Vera Solutions in Mumbai, India, Chhori (Daughter) in Kathmandu, Nepal, and McKinsey & Company in Boston, MA. I hold an MSc in Economics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and a BA in Political Science and South Asian Studies from Dartmouth College.
