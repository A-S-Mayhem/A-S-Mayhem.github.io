I'm a Chemistry PhD student advised by [Prof. Arieh Warshel](https://dornsife.usc.edu/chemistry/warshel/) from [USC Dornsife, Department of Chemistry](https://dornsife.usc.edu/chemistry/about-usc-chemistry/),[University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). My research focuses on biological macromolecules by computational methods. Open to scientific networking, and potential collaboration!

B.S. in Applied Chemistry, [University of Science and Technology Beijing](https://en.ustb.edu.cn/), China, 3.83 GPA, Rank 1/51, 2019

RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
======
06/2020—current SARS-CoV-2 Related Projects (Covalent Inhibitor Design & Spike Protein Mutational Effect Prediction) directed
by Dr. Arjun Saha, Laboratory of Arieh Warshel, Nobel Laureate, USC Department of Chemistry
● Used structure-based information to design potential inhibitors and docked the molecules by Chimera or AutoDock
● Calculated binding affinity of potential inhibitors by PDLD/S-LRA/β simulation in MOLARIS and QM calculations in Gaussian09
● Participated in the design of thermo dynamic cycle used to calculate binding energy
● Using coarse-grained model to systemically investigate the binding free energy changes upon mutations of the individual or
combination of amino acid substitutions for the ACE2-spike complex

01/2019—06/2019 Preparation and Electropolarization of Silk Fibr oin Composite Membr ane directed by Professor Junwei ZHA,
University of Science and Technology Beijing
● Purified Silk Fibroin (SF) from natural cocoons and prepared nano-SF by self-assembly and trypsin hydrolysis methods
● Prepared nano-SF/PVDF composite film by near-field suspension electrospinning
● Analyzed the surface micromorphology, chemical composition and electret effect by SEM, FTIR and TSDC

06/2018—01/2019 Corrosion Analysis directed by Researcher Chao HUA, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of
Sciences
● Independently designed the corrosion simulation experiment
● Analyzed the corrosion product by XRD and MDI Jade software
● Calculated the stable conformations of several alkanolamine molecules and their basic properties, such as bond parameters,
electrostatic potential, IR spectrum by Gaussian 03 and Multiwfn
● Collated the academic and professional literature materials

08/2017—06/2018 Preparation of the Wearable Compliant Per spiration Sensor directed by Professor Tailin XU, University of
Science and Technology Beijing
● Synthesized DMSO-PVDF composite film and modified the material by microwave plasma generator to obtain hydrophilic
active sites and analyzed their hydrophilicity by contact angle measurement
● Collected sweat in situ by hydrophilic micron well on the flexible material and immobilized certain indicator for specific
chromogenic reaction to analyze the concentration of glucose in the sweat
● Took photos and videos to the experimental process

08/2017—12/2017 Research on the Usage of the Standard Substance in the Early Diagnosis of Cancer directed by Professor Yanqiu
CAO, University of Science and Technology Beijing
● Referred the literature materials related to early diagnosis of lung cancer, and recorded the usage of standard substance, participated
in the summary of the usage of standard substance in early cancer diagnosis of the research report

09/2017—12/2017 Pitch Separation fr om Petr oleum thr ough Modified Soxhlet Extr actor directed by Professor Huili FAN, University
of Science and Technology Beijing
● Using limited kinds and number of experimental instruments built a decompression Soxhlet extractor with safety device, which
significantly shortened the distillation cycle of the extract and could be operated in a college student teaching lesson
● Composed the experiment guidebook and lab manual, experiment part of research report and English abstract as the main author
● Awarded the Second Prize in the 9th Beijing College Student Chemistry Experiment Competition

10/2016—10/2017 Modified Cobalt-Chromium Alloy on the Sur face of Hydr oxylapatite thr ough Plasma Electr odeposition directed
by Professor Deren WANG, University of Science and Technology Beijing
● Took charge of the orthogonal experiment design and operation
