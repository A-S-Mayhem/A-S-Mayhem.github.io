Portfolio

I am a graduating senior mechanical engineer at the University of Florida and a thermal sciences R&D intern at Sandia National Labs' National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF). My work is driven by a central question: how can we develop scalable, cost-effective, and dispatchable energy storage systems to enable a renewable-powered future? This quest has guided my efforts in advancing technologies like high-temperature thermal energy storage (TES), alternative hydrogen production, and machine learning for energy sustainability. 

I bring a multidisciplinary perspective, shaped by hands-on experiences across U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories and collaborative projects with startups and global research teams. Alongside my work in renewable energy technologies, I aim to advance projects confronting the effects of climate change directly, from addressing water scarcity in the Peruvian Andes to collaborating with Native American communities on sustainable energy solutions. Whether developing tools for underserved communities or fostering collaboration through open-source platforms, I aim to create solutions that empower people and address systemic inequities in energy access.
