I am a G4 in the Harvard / MIT Program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology (SHBT). My research interests revolve around using multimodal neuroimaging and electrophysiological tecnhiques to uncover relationships between brain structure, function, and behavior, and to explore these associations in neurodevelopmental and learning disorders. I specifically focus on neural mechanisms subserving language and reading. Before starting my doctorate I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) and Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania in May of 2017 and 2018, respectively. My master's thesis (published in Journal of Neuroscience Methods) focused on the utility of common intracranial EEG preprocessing methods when classifiying neural data. Between Penn and Harvard, I was a research coordinator in the Laboratory for NeuroImaging of Coma and Consciousness, examining how neural biometrics obtained in the ICU could predict recovery outcomes for patients with disorders of consciousness from traumatic brain injuries. In the Gabrieli Lab, I am using fMRI and diffusion MRI to explore functional and white matter brain bases in dyslexia and autism. My dissertation project will involve using fMRI and DWI to describe the role of the right inferior frontal gyrus and its connections in positive responses to educational intervention in dyslexia. Outside of class I enjoy running, cooking, and playing music. I am a jazz percussionist (primarily vibraphone) and pianist, and perform with the MIT Jazz Combos.
