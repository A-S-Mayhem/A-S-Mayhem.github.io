I'm a Ph.D. student in the UChicago Department of [Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/). I am an observational cosmologist. I am currently focusing on developing high-precision local distance indicators, like the JAGB method and TRGB, to measure the Hubble constant. I am also interested in using strongly lensed quasar systems to measure cosmological parameters with the [TDCOSMO](http://www.tdcosmo.org/) collaboration.
I received my B.A. in physics at [Penn](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/) in 2019.
