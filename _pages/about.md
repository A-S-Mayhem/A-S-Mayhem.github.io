I am a computational and quantitative sociologist studying politics, organizations, networks, and inequality. I received my Sociology PhD in 2020 from the University of Arizona. I will join Stony Brook University as an assistant professor of [Sociology](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/sociology/) and [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/) this Fall. 

My ongoing work combines statistical, network, and computational methods with large-scale datasets to study shareholder activism and corporate political behavior. My work has been published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12419), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [International Journal of Comparative Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1177/0020715219837752), [American Journal of Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1086/703044), and [PLoS One](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/pone.pdf).

I am currently also working on a project mapping and predicting social distancing behavior combining [SafeGraph](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns) and Facebook data with a deep learning approach. I am also tracking corporate responses to COVID19 focusing on SP500 firms based on social media, corp websites, and third-party info.
