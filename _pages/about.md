I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Microsoft Research New York City](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/). I did my PhD from the depratment of [Computer Science](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), during which I was fortunate to intern at [Microsoft Research, Bangalore](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), [Inria, Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-de-paris), and [Google AI, Mountain View](https://ai.google/). Before that I was a CS undergrad at [IIEST, Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/). 

Research interests: Bandits and Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, Learning theory, Algorithm analysis. 

My current research mainly focuses on developing large-scale robust algorithms for various sequential online decision-making problems under restricted feedback, e.g. preference information, proxy rewards, partial ranking, etc. Some of my other recent ventures also focus on handling non-stationarity in contextual bandits, privacy-preserving recommender systems, improving system performances by combining absolute feedback with relative preferences. In general, I am intrigued by the scopes of learning from unusual or partial monitoring feedback and the gaps between theory and system needs.
