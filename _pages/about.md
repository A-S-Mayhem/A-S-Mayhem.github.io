**Hi!** I'm a first year Ph.D. student in Statistics at Purdue University. Currently, I'm doing applied scientist internship at [AWS Shanghai AI Lab][4], supervised by [Dr. David Wipf][2] and [Mr. Tong He][3]. I received my B.Sc. in Data Science at School of Statistics and Management, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Yixuan Qiu][1].
