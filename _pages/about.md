I am a postdoctoral associate working on deep learning-based perception, path planning and controls for micro aerial vehicle (MAV) systems under the supervision of Dr. [Mozhdeh Shahbazi](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/contacts/mozhdeh-shahbazi) and Dr. [Gunho Sohn](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/users/gunhosohn). Before that, I got my PhD from Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Calgary, under the supervision of Dr. [Alex Ramirez-Serrano](https://www.uvs-robotarium-lab.ca/about-us). My PhD work focused on modeling, controls, and simulations of a quadrupedal track-legged robot. 

I am excited about any technology that improves the autonomy of robotic systems, especially a combination of model-based and data-driven learning techniques.
