# Brief Bio
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/) at McGill University, where I work with [Prof. Jackie C.K. Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/). I got my Ph.D. from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland at the eXascale Infolab group under the supervision of [Prof. Philippe Cudré-Mauroux](https://exascale.info/phil/). During my Ph.D., I did an internship of four months at Alexa Shopping, [Amazon Research](https://www.amazon.science/), based in Seattle. I also hold an engineering degree from SUP’COM (Tunisia). During my university career, I was part of an exchange student program in 2016 at University of Padova in Italy.
