Hello! I'm Arnav Metrani, currently a physics undergraduate at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali.
I'm interested in a lot of things, and I'd like to continue exploring as much as possible.
Feel free to reach out to me via email regarding anything!

I also host a blog on Substack, called [The Lambency of Life](https://lambency.substack.com).
