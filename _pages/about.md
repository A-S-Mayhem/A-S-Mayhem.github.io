Welcome !


I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Paris-Saclay University within [CIRED](http://www.centre-cired.fr) and [PSAE](http://www2.agroparistech.fr/PSAE-Paris-Saclay-Applied-Economics.html) research units. Here is my <a href="RomainFillon.github.io/files/CV_academique.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.


I work on climate change and I am particularly interested in climate tipping points and social preferences under risk and uncertainty.


Feel free to contact me : rfillon@protonmail.com !



Work in progress 
+ "Climate policy, ethics and the uncertain fate of the Amazon rainforest", with T. Gasser (IIASA), C. Guivarch (CIRED) & P. Ciais (LSCE, Paris-Saclay University).
+ "Optimal climate policy under tipping risk and temporal risk aversion", with C. Guivarch (CIRED) & N. Taconet (PIK). Draft available upon request!
