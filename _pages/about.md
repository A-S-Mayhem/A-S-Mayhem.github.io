<h1> Erica Ryan </h1>
<hr>
<p> I started my PhD in Economics at the University of Maryland in the fall of 2020. Prior to this, I attended the University of Maryland, studying Studio Art and Economics and then I worked at Fannie Mae as a Quantitative Modeler in their Model Risk Management group. Of particular interest to me is finding ways to bring economic intuition and creative thinking together. </p>

<p>At Fannie Mae, I reviewed models across the single-family mortgage business including cash flow models and behavioral models for predicting mortgage outcomes. I also studied trends in macroeconomic indicators leading up to and during recessions to better understand how stress scenarios impact borrower behavior. I also had the opportunity to begin reviewing models related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the mortgage industry. My experience at Fannie Mae has guided my current research interests which include housing and the connections between household-level decision making and the broader macro housing landscape, urban development, financial literacy, and poverty. </p>

<p>In my art, I explore ideas of memory and identity in our overly connected world. More recently I have been exploring digital mediums including photography and video projection installations; however, I also employ other mediums such as intaglio print, sculpture, and painting. My most recent project is an extension of the piece "To [be] See[n]" and I am hoping to explore the connections between familiar and discomfort. </p>
