Hi, I am Ata Otaran. I specialize in designing tangible and intelligent interfaces that interact with both humans and their environment through physical interaction. My research combines robotics and human perception to create novel, immersive experiences.

I earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Sabancı University, Istanbul, where I worked in the Human-Machine Interaction Lab under Prof. Volkan Patoglu. My master’s research focused on hands-on teaching of key concepts in force feedback and series elastic actuation. For this, I designed [HandsOn-SEA](https://github.com/aotaran/HandsOnSEA), an admittance-type version of widely used [haptic paddles](https://hapkit.stanford.edu/) and made it available as a open source hardware. This device was later integrated into the curriculum of a robotics course. Also, an enlarged version of the same design was used for a force-feedback car pedal project.

For my PhD, I moved to London to work with Dr. Ildar Farkhatdinov on locomotion in VR. We were both interested in how haptic feedback can enhance foot-driven interactions. My research explored foot-driven locomotion interfaces for controlling VR avatars or teleoperated robots. This research focused on using a seated posture, as it provides more body stability and a chance to interact with table-top haptic interfaces. I investigated the effect of different foot input methods, terrain-based haptic feedback, and gesture-to-locomotion mapping strategies on criteria such as the ease of learning, sense of movement, realism, and motion sickness through user studies.

I have long had the idea that the traditional haptic interfaces were lacking shape display capabilities. During my postdoctoral research in the HCI Group of Saarland University, led by Prof. Jürgen Steimle, explored the use of metamaterial-based shape-changing interfaces that generate dynamic, tangible surface topologies for physical interaction. My vision with these metamaterial structures is to provide a design space where developers can easily define their desired shape change and use computational fabrication tools to optimize their design. Embedding actuation and sensing units into metamaterial structures, I aim to create generalizable solutions for shape displays with intelligent haptic interaction capabilities.
