I am a second year Ph.D. student in [Management Science/ Operations Research](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/phd/dissertation-areas/management-science-and-operations-management) at The University of Chicago, Booth School of Business. My research advisors are [René Caldentey](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/rene-caldentey?_ga=2.143548341.1856357377.1668716911-1774430081.1668716911&_gl=1*ua7x8l*_ga*MTc3NDQzMDA4MS4xNjY4NzE2OTEx*_ga_PDRJWHFTEV*MTY2ODczMDAxNC4yLjEuMTY2ODczMDQxOC4zNC4wLjA.) and [Rad Niazadeh](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/rad-niazadeh).

I am interested in studying the interplay of Economics and Computer Science and enjoy looking at the real world problems using a mathematical lens. In particular, I am interested in Game Theory, Revenue Management, Online Algorithms and Online Learning.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, Iran. Before joining Booth, I did a master's in [Finance & Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2023/MSc-Finance-and-Economics) at London School of Economics, UK.
