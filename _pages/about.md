Hi! I am currently an algorithm expert in Alimama Tech at Alibaba Group. I received my Ph.D. degree in June 2021 from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and my B.Eng. degree in June 2016 from Wuhan University (WHU).  

Research Interests
======
My research interests are in computational advertising and information retrieval, and broader interests include transfer learning, text generation, federated learning and their applications in advertising, recommendation and search.   

During my Ph.D., my research interests were in natural language processing and social media analytics, especially *opinion mining* and *opinionated/argumentative text generation* in low-resource scenarios (e.g., cross-domain transfer, learning with noisy labels and sequence generation with few paired data).
