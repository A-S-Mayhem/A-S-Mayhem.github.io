Hi, I'm Aubrey J. Rembert, a computer scientist in the Content Science department of [Pandora Media](http://www.pandora.com). Currently, my work is focused on applications of Artificial Intelligence to Data Integration and Knowledge Base construction. Prior to working at Pandora, I was a Research Staff Member at [IBM T. J. Watson Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com) studying machine learning approaches to enterprise integration and evolution in the Business Service Analyics department.
 
I earned a B.S. and M.S. in Computer and Information Systems from [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University](http://www.famu.edu), with a minor in Business Administration; and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Colorado at Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu). My research career has been focused on developing large scale adaptive systems tools to support enterprise integration. I sometimes consult with organizations to help them develop strategies and tools to enable them to become more data-driven.
