I am a PhD student in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. I am working with [Blake Sherwin](http://bccp.berkeley.edu/sherwin/) at the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/). The main focus of my work are cross-correlations between large scale cosmic structure and gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background. I develop models to test the physics of cosmic structure formation, neutrino masses and the expansion rate of the universe.

I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Physcis from Haverford College in May 2020. At Haverford I worked with [Daniel Grin](http://danielgrin.net/) and [Bruce Partridge](https://www.haverford.edu/users/bpartrid).
