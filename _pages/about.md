Research Interet 
======
My research interests span a broad range of topics including quantitative genetics and animal breeding. My recent research includes 1) longitudinal modeling of image-based phenomic data using a genomic random regression model, 2) structural equation model-based GWAS, and 3) genomic connectedness.
