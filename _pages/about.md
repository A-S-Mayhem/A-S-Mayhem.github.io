My name is Matthew Craig and I'm a Ph.D. student at [Kent State University's College of Communication & Information](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj26YSc6uj1AhXBIDQIHSaWDdsQFnoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kent.edu%2Fcci&usg=AOvVaw04BGhcYaaYgr9IEWDwWGxl). My research concerns communication technology and its impact on society and interpersonal communication.

Feel free to look around, this is my personal site.
