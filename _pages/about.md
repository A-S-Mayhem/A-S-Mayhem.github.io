Hello! Welcome to my web page. 

I am a first-year doctoral student at Aalto University. I am working on an interdisciplinary project in the LeTech (Learning + Technology) research group, which combines knowledge in computing education, and my interest in AI/ML. 

## Me and my research

I first developed an interest in education from my teaching assistant experience at the University of Liege. I believe improving education is one of the best ways to positively impact society, and I consider AI as a turning stone.  

I completed a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Liege, but I came to Aalto to work on my master's thesis. In my thesis, I applied data mining and machine learning techniques to study how students learn in an online course and how their learning behaviors can be used to predict who will drop out. My highlighted, among other things, that struggling with programming assignments is one of the main factors for dropping out of a course. To alleviate this problem, it is important to support students when they learn how to program. However, it is difficult for educational teams to provide each student with detailed help and feedback, especially for large classes. 

My doctoral dissertation aims to address this issue. My goal is to develop machine learning methods that can automatically discover challenges students face when working on their programming assignments and provide feedback that addresses these challenges. 

For this purpose, I aim to leverage recent advances in deep learning models.

Stay tuned! 

## This website

It is currently a bit empty since I just started my doctoral studies. My goal is to use these pages to present who I am, showcase my work, and share my thoughts with others. I will write in these pages primarily as an exercise, because I believe part of being a researcher is being able to communicate effectively with others, both in person and online.
