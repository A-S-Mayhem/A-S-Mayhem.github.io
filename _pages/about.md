I pursue my __PhD in Experimental Finance__ at Radboud University, the Netherlands, which I expect to complete in July 2024.

My research delves into the economic behavior of individuals in the fields of:
* Risk Perception
* Household Finance
* Intertemporal Choice
* Asset Pricing
* Human-Machine Interaction

Check out my published work "History Matters: How short-term price charts hurt investment performance" (Journal of Banking & Finance) as well as my other projects under [Research](https://markusstrucks.github.io//research/).

Under [Teaching](https://markusstrucks.github.io//teaching/), you can find more information about my experience in course coordination, lecturing and supervision.

As a behavioral economist I have a passion for the psychology of risky choice. My research delves into the intricate ties between individual risk perceptions and investment behaviors, spanning both short and long-term horizons. Consider this scenario: Faced with an upcoming salary bonus, do we splurge on a skiing trip or contribute to our retirement savings? Such decisions hinge on a myriad of factors, which I explore in my research.
