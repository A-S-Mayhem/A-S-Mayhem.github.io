# Introduction
I am a machine learning engineer at [Realtor.com](www.https://www.realtor.com/) and former researcher focused on developing scalable models for both inference and prediction in geospatial settings with a focus on latent variable models and Bayesian methods. My educational background consists of degrees in [physics (BA, 2013)](https://www.macalester.edu/physics/), [statistics (MS, 2020)](https://stat.duke.edu/), and [civil engineering (PhD, 2020)](http://borsuk.pratt.duke.edu/) . 

I have consulted in the past for firms using Bayesian methods in marketing analytics and have previously worked in the healthcare sector as a database engineer. I also worked as a part of the GeoAI research group at Oak Ridge National Lab. I currently work on problems related to security and geospatial modeling.  I also have teaching experience as a university instructor for graduate-level classes in applied statistical modeling. You can find more additional information at the curriculum vitae linked on this webpage. 

# Previous research projects
![image](images/research_banner.png)

A short list of my past research efforts are shown below. A common vein running through all of them is that they typically involve some element of observational or structural uncertainty, necessitating probabilistic analysis. Additionally, they often involve data which is intrinsically spatial in nature and is thus amenable to spatial statistical methods.
 
* Statistical wetland modeling
* Integrating expert knowledge in posterior simulation for geospatial categorical data
* Dimension reduction for high-dimensional data
* Bayesian inference for engineering models
* Leveraging graphical structure in deep generative models

------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
