I am a second year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania working in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision under the supervision of Prof. Chris Callison-Burch and Prof. Mark Yatskar. 

<!-- Aside from my research, I co-lead Penn's Team for the [Amazon Alexa Taskbot Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/academic-engagements/amazon-launches-new-alexa-prize-taskbot-challenge). If you have an Alexa device you can say "Alexa, assist me!" to interact with one of the team's bots and help give anonymous feedback!

Brief Background
======
I graduated from the Dual Degree Program of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pennsylvania with a BAS and an MSE in Computer and Information Science, a BA (Hons) Cognitive Science, and a BA (hons) in Philosophy. During my time at Penn I worked at GRASP Lab under the supervision of Prof. Kostas Daniilidis on estimating Optical Flow with Spiking Neural Networks and in NLP under the supervision of Prof. Mitch Marcus and Prof. Chris Callison-Burch on Metaphor Interpretation through Textual Entailment. It was not long before I realised that both fields have a lot to gain from each other so I decided to pursue a PhD and focus on the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. 

After finishing my Master's, I was honored to receive the President's Engagement Prize that allowed me to participate in the founding of a medicine redistribution platform, enabling low-income patients to access essential medicines at extremely affordable prices while preventing wastage of medicines lying unused in warehouses.

During the first year of my PhD, aside from my research, I co-lead Penn's Team for the [Amazon Alexa Taskbot Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/academic-engagements/amazon-launches-new-alexa-prize-taskbot-challenge). Our product was one of the five finalists of the competition!
