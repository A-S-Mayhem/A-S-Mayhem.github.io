## My Background and Interests
{% newthought 'At present, I am a Lecturer in Spacecraft Engineering'%} at Queen Mary University of
London in the UK{% sidenote 'One' '[My QMUL page](https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/robotics/people/ananjangud/)' %}.
Since entering academia in 2020, I have attempted to traverse the twofold research and education
landscape in a manner that I think can expand consciousness- mine as well as of those who try
to work with me. This is especially that case (I'd like to think) for students and early
career researchers.

Everything I learned about my academic field of expertise (classical mechanics and
multibody dynamics) and its effective written communication was from the
[late Prof. Fidels O. Eke](https://web.archive.org/web/20230127150437/https://mae.ucdavis.edu/news/memoriam-professor-emeritus-fidelis-eke){% sidenote '' '[His UC Davis obituary](https://mae.ucdavis.edu/news/memoriam-professor-emeritus-fidelis-eke)' %},
a truly extraordinary scholar and gentleman. Towards the completion of my PhD, I was fortunate to
be accepted by [Dr. Abhi Jain](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/who-we-are/people/abhinandan_jain/)
to spend a year at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's DARTSLab](https://dartslab.jpl.nasa.gov),
where his group works on fundamental aspects of computational/algorithmic multibody robot
dynamics while applying them in the context of various NASA missions. This was followed by
a postdocotoral appointment at the [Surrey Space Centre](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/surrey-space-centre)-
here, I drove research for [SSTL](https://www.sstl.co.uk) and Airbus into developing missions,
architectures, and technology development/demonstration plans for robotic
[in-space assembly](http://angadhn.com/publication/2023-06-01-towards-robotic-on-orbit-assembly) while also
driving development of lab-based technology demonstration testbeds. Here, again, my worldview
was expanded by [Prof. Craig Underwood](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/craig-underwood),
who possesses an encyclopaedic knowledge of space missions while also being a proper space engineer with
a deep understanding of technologies across various spacecraft subsystems. These experiences and mentors
got me working in space robotics where my group works on fundamental engineering science-based know-hows
towards realising futuristic space systems/technologies.

## My Research and Pedagogic Philosophy: Tasteful engineering creativity via constructivist experimentation
My new approach to personal learning and pedagogic growth bears some parallels to Papert's
constructivist philosophy. My interpretation of this is that intuition and interest comes from
experimenting with new and previously unknown interactive tools, much like a child playing with an
ever-expanding collection of toys, to enhance their understanding of the world. My belief is that
this leads to one eventually uncovering{% sidenote '' 'In some cases, even _discovering_'.%} their
interests, which I see as an important precursor to developing taste. I am writing this while
reflecting on the efforts of some extraordinary students who, over the Summer of 2024, collectively 
created an online textbook on Spacecraft Dynamics[^a] based on previous handwritten lecture notes.

For students, I like to emphases exploration-based learning (as opposed to ), which deviates from
the conventions of formal academia that are examination-focused (as much as my role permits).
The dangers of eschewing exploration in educaation is bearing the anti-fruit in the extant
populist model of STEM research where group leaders are focused on enhancing personal metrics
by collecting more publications in a bid to raise personal research productivity indices
{%sidenote '' 'A classic case of Goodhartâ€™s law. My issue is that these metrics are not an
effective measure of the true outputs from academia- the career of advisees [^b].
Of course, this presumes advisees must also be self-motivated to grow their opportunities.'%}.
My conclusion is that a lot of today's professoriate are not too different from
philatelists[^c] but a potential answer lies in updating incentive structures. Or at least
clarifying them; a funder should make clear it wants only journall papers or only datasets or
a combination of these (and other) outputs.

#### Footnotes
[^a]: The students built on prior basic knowledge of Python, $$\LaTeX$$, and Markdown but more importantly some of them learned how to thoroughly review [pull requests](https://github.com/angadhn/SpacecraftDynamics/pulls). They were able to teach their friends, via remote pair programming, how to make contributions without my direct supervision. In the process, this team also taught me about sensibly coordinating a larger Github project while flying by the seat of my pants. I would like to think that we all grew a bit.

[^b]: Can one teach another **how** to love something?

[^c]: A commentary will be needed from me to clarify this as I do believe that documentation is important in STEM but more important is training future scientists to be effectively communicate in writing.
