Hello there! ðŸ‘‹  I'm a second-year undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science at UC Davis. I'm passionate about all things tech and constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Currently, I'm on the lookout for internships that will allow me to apply what I've learned in the classroom to real-world projects.

My primary fascination lies in the exciting realm of Machine Learning. I'm on a journey to explore various machine learning algorithms, including the likes of linear and logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and clustering. These algorithms are the building blocks of modern artificial intelligence, and I find their potential to transform industries endlessly intriguing.

In addition to my coursework, I'm also gaining hands-on experience as a research assistant in the Breakerspace Lab, under the guidance of Dr. Zubair Shafiq. Here, my focus is on web security, specifically in the field of ad fraud. We're working tirelessly to build an ad archive that will shed light on the fascinating and ever-evolving world of online advertisements. It's an exciting project that combines my passion for technology with the desire to make the internet a safer place for everyone.

When I'm not immersed in the world of code and research, you might find me exploring new technologies, tinkering with personal projects, or simply enjoying a good book. I believe in the power of continuous learning and am always excited to embark on new challenges.

Feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests, want to collaborate on a project, or just want to chat about the latest trends in tech. I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and expand my network in the ever-evolving tech community.
