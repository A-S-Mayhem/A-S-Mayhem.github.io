My name is Taylor Grimm, and I am a first year PhD student in Statistics at Baylor University. I graduated in 2021 from Brigham Young University with a B.S. in Statistical Science and a minor in mathematics.

While at BYU, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant for a year working on Bayesian models for estimating elemental profiles of pollution source profiles and their contributions at various locations.

As a graduate assistant at Baylor, I have helped with the development of a multi-day data science workshop for professionals in the water/wastewater treatment industry and am currently working as a graduate student statistical consultant.
