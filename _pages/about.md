I am Vasudha Varadarajan, a second year PhD student working in the areas of natural language processing and the relationships between cognition and language, especially in the context of social media. I work with Prof. H. Andrew Schwartz in the State University of New York at Stony Brook. I am interested in the intersection of psychology and language since it offers an insight into language modeling in a human-centric point of view. I am also interested in interpretibility and explainability of linguistic models, multilingual models for NLP and generalizable language modeling.
