I am 3rd year PhD candidate in Economics at Northwestern University. My research interests are in macroeconomics and industrial organization, with a special focus on incorporating microeconomic production into macroeconomic models (e.g. the production network). Prior to my PhD, I studied (and [ran!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eidacczk0gg)) at the University of Chicago, served as an AmeriCorps VISTA at the [IndyEast Promise Zone](https://indyeast.org), and worked as pre-doc at Northwestern.
