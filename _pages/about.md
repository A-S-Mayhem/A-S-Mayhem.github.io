 I am Mostafa Osama Ahmed Metwally Othman, a dedicated and results-oriented Robotics professional actively seeking opportunities in the field. With a Master's degree in Robotics and Computer Vision from Innopolis University, Russia, and a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Nile University, Egypt, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to contribute to cutting-edge projects within the robotics industry.

Throughout my academic journey and practical experiences, I have developed a strong passion for Robotics, Teleoperation, Virtual Reality, Computer Vision, Control, Machine Learning,  Haptics, and Human-Robot Interaction. My research and project work have focused on teleoperation and control of robotic systems, where I have consistently delivered innovative solutions for complex tasks.

One of my notable achievements includes my Master's thesis project, where I explored haptic control and force feedback to teleoperate a Kuka IIWA robot, successfully executing precise Peg-In-Hole tasks using different control modes. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience in teleoperating a cable-driven robot via a Touch Haptic device, demonstrating my ability to integrate cutting-edge technologies into practical applications.

My technical skill set includes proficiency in Unity3D, MATLAB, SOLIDWORKS, Arduino, ROS, Python, C++, and Git, enabling me to effectively implement state-of-the-art solutions. I am adept at leveraging machine learning techniques, applying computer vision algorithms, and optimizing control systems for enhanced robotic performance.

Beyond technical prowess, I possess exceptional organizational and leadership skills. As the former Chairman of the Robotronics student club, I successfully led a team and managed multiple projects, fostering a collaborative environment and driving impactful results. Furthermore, I have served as an instructor and coach, mentoring teams in various robotics competitions, showcasing my ability to inspire and guide others towards success.

In my quest for continuous growth and professional development, I stay updated with the latest technological trends and industry advancements. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to progressive projects, working alongside talented individuals in the robotics industry.

If you are a recruiter or an engineer from a robotics company seeking a dedicated professional with a strong background in Robotics and Computer Vision, I invite you to explore my portfolio to gain deeper insights into my projects and achievements. I am open to exciting career opportunities and collaboration ventures, and I welcome any inquiries or further information you may require. [projects](https://mostafa-metwaly.github.io/portfolio/).
