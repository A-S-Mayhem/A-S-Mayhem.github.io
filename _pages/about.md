I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of AI in Management, LMU Munich. I do causal machine learning research under the supervision of [prof. Stefan Feuerriegel](https://www.ai.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/index.html).

I believe in the data-driven automation and human-computer cooperation – they should become the main booster of sustainable development and inclusive society.

My research interests include
- Causal Machine Learning / Treatment Effect Estimation
- Causal Inference
- Probabilistic Modelling
