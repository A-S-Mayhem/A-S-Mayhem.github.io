Hi! I'm Avery, a full-time student and part-time hobbyist. Professionally, I've interned in the power industry for two summers, with much of my work centering around the development of in-house arc flash risk assessment programs and the design of electrical substations. Outside of that, my interests center around robotics and digital computer electronics.
