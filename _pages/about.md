I'm a third-year Ph.D student in the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at California Institute of Technology (Caltech).
I earned my B.S. in Physics from University of Science and Technology of China.
My research interests including development of electronic structure algorithms and machine learning methods, while my current research is combining them together.
I loving mathematics and coding a lot, as well as using them to solve real-world problems.
