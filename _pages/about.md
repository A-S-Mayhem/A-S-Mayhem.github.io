I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/de">Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics</a> (MPA) in Garching supervised by <a href="https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~komatsu/">Eiichiro Komatsu</a>. I am interested in the physics of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization and in the development of simulations for the next-generation CMB experiments, LiteBIRD in particular. I'm currently focusing on how half-wave plate (HWP) non-idealities can impact the science that can be extracted from CMB polarization.
