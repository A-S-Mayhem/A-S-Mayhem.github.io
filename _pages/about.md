I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Yale University. I specialize in international political economy and the political economy of development, with a particular focus on foreign aid.  I also work on the international politics of science and technology. Prior to starting the PhD, I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Kosovo. I have a Master's in English literature and a very cute cat named Tara. I am a Research Fellow for the Changing Nature of Aid project at the Research on International Policy Implementation Lab, an affiliate of the Bridging the Gap program. I founded and co-organize the Graduate Student International Political Economy (GSIPE) workshop.
