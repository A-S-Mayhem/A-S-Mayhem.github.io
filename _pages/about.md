Hi! I am now a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/), Beijing, China. My major research interests are Natural Language Processing and Social Media Analytics. Prior to CASIA, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in 2016.  
<br/>

  
Research Interests
======
My research targets at developing computational methods to analyze and mine socially-generated contents. Currently, I focus on the following areas:

Opinion Mining and Stance Analysis
* **Social Media Analytics and Social Computing**  
Rumor Verification and Fact Checking  
<br/>
