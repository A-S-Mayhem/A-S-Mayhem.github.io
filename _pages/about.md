## Who am I?

Hello, I'm Ali Keramati. I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering, with a minor in Educational Sciences, from the University of Tehran. I proudly served as an undergraduate research assistant at several research labs, including the Cognitive Systems Lab, Technology Enhanced Learning Lab (TELAB), the University of Queensland (remotely), UT NLP Group, and the Embodied Design Research Lab at UC Berkeley (remotely).

Through my experiences as a student, teacher, and teaching assistant in academia, I noticed several challenges faced by both students and teachers that technology could address. These experiences shaped my long-term goal: **to use technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), to make substantial improvements in learning, teaching, and assessment.**

## Research Interests

My research focuses on using Large Language Models **(LLMs)** in education to make learning more engaging for students and teaching more effective for instructors through the development of tools like personalized chatbots tailored to individual learners and automated scoring and feedback systems. With a background in machine learning, I am passionate about **learning analytics** and **education data science**. Specifically, I am interested in leveraging techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation **(RAG)**, **fine-tuning**, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback **(RLHF)** to enhance LLM performance on targeted educational tasks.

In addition to my computational interests, I am eager to work as a **digital learning designer**. I aspire to integrate my developed models into real-world classroom settings to test their effectiveness within innovative, digitalized teaching approaches. My background in learning design and research in collaborative learning fuels my passion for computer-supported collaborative learning **(CSCL)**, and I am excited to create and implement models that facilitate productive collaboration among learners. As I continue to learn and grow, I am excited to bridge the gap between technology and education, creating innovative solutions that make learning effective, accessible, and engaging for all.

I am also deeply interested in exploring philosophical and psychological questions at the intersection of human cognition and LLMs. This includes comparing human capabilities in learning, knowledge storage, and memory with those of LLMs, evaluating various models on these dimensions, and developing innovative approaches to better align LLM functions with human cognitive processes.


## Other Interests

In addition to my passion for technology, I have a deep love for the arts. From painting and music to movies and theater, I find inspiration in various creative forms. Movies and series captivate me, painting is my outlet for creativity, and music fuels my focus. Last summer, I delved into the world of acting and film direction in a school theater named [Tazeh Theater](https://www.instagram.com/tazeh_theater/?hl=en), enhancing my understanding of cinematic storytelling.

As a former and retired soccer player for [Esteghlal F.C. U17](https://www.transfermarkt.com/esteghlal-fc-u17/startseite/verein/88915), I continue my passion for the sport and occasionally join friends on the field.
