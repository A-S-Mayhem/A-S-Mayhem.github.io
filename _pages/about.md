Hi :) I am currently a tired-year (BSc) student at [American International University-Bangladesh](https://www.aiub.edu/) .

My primary research interest Competitive programming.I am also interested in other areas of theoretical computer science such as sublinear algorithms, combinatorial algorithms, and statistics.

I also have many interests apart from research, including competitive programming (see more [here](/others)).
