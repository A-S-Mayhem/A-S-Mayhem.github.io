My name is Marcy Shieh and I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I study American politics with a concentration in judicial politics. My research interests include judicial elections, judicial selection methods, judicial decision-making, campaigns, text analysis, and survey experiments.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
