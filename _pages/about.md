I research the complex processes that connect rocks, water, and life. I enjoy working in interdisciplinary science research and education aspects. My deep interest lies in integrating geoscience, mineralogy, biogeochemistry, and geomicrobiology with climate and environmental pollution that impact water quality, water security, and food security. As a geoscientist, the scientific tools that fascinate me most include geo-thermochronometric dating, luminescence dating, geomorphometric analysis, and reactive transport modeling in porous medium. These tools can provide data about erosion and weathering patterns, regolith formation, and biogeochemical cycling from sediment, rock, and soil sample. Integrating these data can help in understanding how natural processes and humans shape Earth's surface.
