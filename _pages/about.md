I am a mathematician and education researcher with a strong interest in faculty development.  I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis in 2012, and then worked at the University of Alabama.  In 2016 I moved to the University of South Alabama, where my work shifted to include  more educational research, Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, and an increasing amount of faculty development.

I have a strong interest around __alternative grading__ practices, which I have been using in my own classes since 2015.  In addition, I have written several papers researching the effects of these on students.  I have also given a number of faculty development workshops on the topic, and serve on the organizing team of the [Grading Conference](/projects/The-Grading-Conference).

Another area of current interest is the use of __Team-Based Inquiry Learning (TBIL)__ in mathematics courses.  I am currently the lead PI on an [NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education grant](/projects/Team-Based-Inquiry-Learning), in which we are training faculty in the use of TBIL and studying their implementation at universities across the country.

I often speak and give workshops on a number of topics such as alternative grading, inclusive teaching, Team-Based Learning and Team-Based Inquiry Learning. Please reach out by email if you are interested in having me present at your institution.
