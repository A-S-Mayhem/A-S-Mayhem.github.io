After the National College Entrance Examination (Gaokao), I chose a unique destination (Taipei) for further education. At present, I am a final-year undergraduate at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Academically, I am good at mathematics (mostly A+), while poor at electronic (averagely C). On reflection, I find the general truth of my study---the work won't be hard if I am interested in it (there is a will, there is a way), while I will not work hard if I am not interested (hard to keep motivated if not out of interest). Currently, I enjoy researching like a scientist, meanwhile, I am ready to get my hands dirty as an engineer.

My struggle
======
I have prevented myself from the trap of studying only for high grades and beating my peers. Though it keeps me away from the stereotype of a good student, I do enjoy the freedom to explore the subjects I am curious about, which provides consistent motivation for my works.
