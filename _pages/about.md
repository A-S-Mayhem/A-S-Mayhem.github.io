Welcome! I’m a PhD Student at the University of São Paulo (USP). I’m currently a Researcher of Inequality and Taxation at the Research Center on Macroeconomics of Inequalities (Made/USP). I'm also a working group coordinator at the Young Scholars Initiative of the Institute for New Economic Thinking (YSI/INET). I visited the Industrial Relations Section at Princeton University from February to March 2023.

My research interests include public finance, macroeconomics, and their intersection with labor economics, particularly in relation to gender, race and income inequality. I am particularly interested in how different tax policies affect inequality.
