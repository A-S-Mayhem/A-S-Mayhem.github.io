Hello!

Welcome to my website. 


My academic interests are in development economics and environmental economics. As an applied microeconomist, I rigorously approach data collection, analysis, and policy recommendations with a strong foundation in causal inference.  My current research addresses cattle health and production challenges in Kenya, aiming to improve economic well-being using framed field experiments and impact evaluation methods. My research also addresses sustainability, covering quality quantity issues in common pool resources. Additionally, I am also actively involved in developing a 5-year grant proposal for USAID's Feed the Future Animal Health Innovation Lab Phase 2.

As a Ph.D. candidate at Washington State University, I have independently taught courses in Intermediate Macroeconomics and the Economics of Sports in America. My teaching experience spans both online and in-person formats.
