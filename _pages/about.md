About me
======
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of biostatistics, epidemiology, and informatics (DBEI) at University of Pennsylvania. I am working on imaging genetics, in terms of methological approaches (e.g., joint modeling, machine learning modeling), with [Prof. Li Shen](https://www.med.upenn.edu/shenlab/).  

Before joining UPENN, I completed my Ph.D in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University under the the supervision of [Prof. Hyunjin Park](https://mipskku.wixsite.com/mipl)).
