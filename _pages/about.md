> *01/23*: I'm ***in the job market for industry positions***, such as Applied scientist, Data scientist, User experience researcher, etc. I design and build systems that facilitate the consumption of online educational resources for general users and support human-AI interactions for end-users. Please reach out if you know of any opportunities! 


I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at University of California, Davis, working with Professor [Hao-Chuan Wang](http://www.haochuanwang.info/). My research area is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Data Science (DS), with a focus on social collaboration, including peer production, peer support, collaborative consumption, online informal learning, and social computing. My studies use social interaction mechanisms and human-centered AI approaches to understand and facilitate general online users to forage, evaluate, and apply knowledge online individually and in group.


I hold a B.S. in Statistics from Hunan University (2016) and an M.S. in Statistics from University of California, Davis (2018).
