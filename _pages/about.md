===
I am a research assistant and Ph.D. student in Economics at the Chair of Economic Policy and Economic Research at [Dresden University of Technology](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/wirtschaft/vwl/wuw). Specilizing in applied microeconomics, my research is primarily in the fields of political economy and social choice. My research centers on the examination of policy effects on voting behavior, specifically addressing topics such as the influence of information on voting modes and turnout, the consequences of relocating polling stations on voter turnout, and the impact of natural reserves on party outcomes. 
# Employing (spatial) administrative data as my primary analytical tool, my work aims to provide concise and # informative insights into these phenomena.
