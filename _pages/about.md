Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Emory University's Political Science Department. I lead the [International Shaming Events (ISE) data project](https://j1wonkim.github.io/portfolio/ise/) with a team of undergraduate students at Emory.

I study inter-state enforcement and contestation of human rights norms. My dissertation addresses human rights rhetoric as a part of US diplomacy and develops a measurement of state shaming intensity. My works use natural language processing (NLP), network analysis, and survey experiments. 
 

I have an interest in different models of collaborative research. My passion for political science started when I was an exchange student in Hong Kong, during the Umbrella Movement in 2014. I received my B.A. in English literature and linguistics from Sungkyunkwan University in the beautiful and traditional neighborhood of Jongno in Seoul, South Korea.
