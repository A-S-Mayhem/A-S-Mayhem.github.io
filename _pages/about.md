Nguyen, Ngoc Hung is a senior AI engineer at FPT software, previous Ngoc Hung served as a senior software engineer at LG Electronics. He obtained his engineering degree from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in 2018. In 2023, He completed his Master's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Hanyang University, Ansan, Korea.

His research interests lie in the realm of software engineering within the fields of edge/cloud computing and computer systems. In addition, his primary focuses include greedy algorithms, graph theory, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL).


Research Journey
======

Nguyen, Ngoc Hung started his research journey when I was a student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. He deployed research with his labmate at the Motor Design Lab under the supervision of Prof. [Bui Minh Dinh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lACArY4AAAAJ) and Chemical Processing Lab under guide of Prof. [Nguyen Dang Binh Thanh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uu5VPhcAAAAJ&hl=vi&oi=sra), here, He did researches in numerical methods, computer system, and motor design. This research then led him to receive a third award for the student research competition at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

He was a master's student at Hanyang University in Electronics under the supervision of Prof. [Sang-Woon Jeon](link). Thanks to Prof. Jeon guided and led him to understand all the research concepts and writing skills. During this time, Ngoc Hung dug deeper into the AI field, especially deep reinforcement learning, Markovian decision process as well as the computer and cloud systems.

Research Interest
======
The problem in Mobile Edge Computing and related issues attracts Nguyen, Ngoc Hung.


Current works
------
Currently, Nguyen, Ngoc Hung is a key member of the quantization teams at AI Center, FPT Software. This project gives him an understanding more about the AI compiler, compress model, and quantization.

In addition, the collaboration with Prof. [Van-Dinh Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wgsX_zIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) gave him a chance to keep on my interest in edge/cloud areas. The work is updated at [ITS research works](https://github.com/ngochungnguyenlg/ITS_paper).
