I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre of Excellence in Oil, Gas and Energy (CoEOGE), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), India. I work on novel software solution for estimating the trajectory of a Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG), in colaboration with the Pipeline Research Division of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). I use online EKF based and offline optimization based estimation methods for estimating PIG trajectory. I have my doctoral degree from a joint PhD programme of IITB-Monash Research Academy, where I developed optimization techniques for network based planning solutions to inspect railway tracks using multiple heterogeneous instrumented wagons. I have a specialisation in Control Systems with a background in Electrical Engineering. 

**My research interests:** Optimization - *Offline Trajectory Estimation, Trajectory Optimization, Dynamic Programming, Column Generation, Branch-and-cut, Benders' decomposition, Deep Reinfrocement Learning;* and Control - *Extended Kalman Filter, Constrained Optimal Control, Fuzzy Control.* 

**Systems I have worked on:** Pipeline Inspection Gauge, Strapdown Inertial Navigation System, Multi-agent time-dependent network, Unicycle, Inverted Cart Pendulum, Pressure Control Tank System, Robotic Arm, Quadruped, etc.
