## Research Interest
My  work is mainly inspired by the works of Ann Swinder, Pierre Bourdieu, Adepoju Aderanti, Thomas F. Pettigrew, David Card, Alan Krueger,  Matthijs Kalmijn, Alejandro Portes, John H. Goldthorpe, George J. Borjas,  David McKenzie, Chris Woodruff, Dean Karlan and Christopher Udry among others. These authors often examine the interwoven relationship between  **cultural orientation ** and return to  **human capital** - I often find their works speaking to mine. My doctoral dissertation mainly discusses lower  **returns to education for educated returnees** who signal “foreignness” when seeking their first jobs and that the nature of the bifurcation existing within job roles they apply to reduces a recruiter’s intention to select them. I am interested in expanding my doctoral research and writing a book. Because my  **survey experiment** only focuses on younger educated returnees to Nigeria, I argue that the experiences of older returnees who have spent more time abroad are different. Additionally, my previous research does not undercut the experiences of returnees after they are hired which is the broader goal of my research The questions I aim to answer include (1) Are educated returnees able to apply foreign-earned skills and knowledge in their home country? (2) Can we estimate the effect of  **reintegration** programs? (3) Do returnees have a different disposition based on their motivation for return or migration? (4) Does the nature of return migration change the skill composition of the home country (5) Can we further estimate the effect of other cultural capital used by returnees and whether it plays a role in their labour market integration? I also aim to ask these questions and conduct more experiments in other  **African countries** and among educated migrants in the US Other research includes asking similar questions above using secondary data - to examine the skill differentials between migrants and native Americans across different levels of education - and to seek other ways in which education inequalities affect labour market outcomes. The main goal is to engage students and faculty within the department to answer these questions and related ones - and to tribute to the department’s goals of producing innovative and inclusive research which can be published in reputable social sciences journals

I hope to integrate quantitative/computational methods with qualitative methods to answer these questions.
