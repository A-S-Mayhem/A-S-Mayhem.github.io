I am a full-time research assistant at THU-EVAR lead by [Prof. Yang Gao](https://yang-gao.weebly.com/), [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Science](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My research interest concentrates on sample & computationally efficient reinforcement learning, safe reinforcement learning, and intersections with power system control and robotics. Low-carbon smart grids can help reduce carbon emissions, mitigate climate changes, and achieve sustainable development. Embodied intelligence helps to liberate productivity, keeping humans away from dangerous work and labor exploitation. My ultimate goal is to create a harmonious world with advanced RL/ML technologies, whether between people or between humans and the nature.

Prior to this RA position, I was a master student advised by Yang. I got my bachelor's degree at [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University.
