About Me
=====
I am post-doctoral associate at the University of Florida in Gainesville. As a geodynamicist, I'm interested in modelling the Earth's mantle and understanding its interaction with the surface. I'm particularly interested in how volatiles and noble gases can give us insight into Earth evolution.
