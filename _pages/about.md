I am currently a pre-doctoral research specialist working with Henrik Kleven and Ilyana Kuziemko at Princeton University. My research interests lie at the intersection of public economics, development, and gender. I graduated with an MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics in 2018, after receiving my Bachelor's degree in Economics from St. Stephen's College, Delhi University. Besides economics, I enjoy playing the piano, listening to British rock music, and trying to perfect the five dishes I know how to cook.
