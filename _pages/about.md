About
======

Hola Hola! I am Felipe Santibáñez-Leal, a postdoctoral researcher at the Advanced Laboratory for Geostatistical Supercomputing [ALGES](http://www.alges.cl/), [AMTC](http://www.amtc.cl/?lang=en) - [DIMIN](http://www.minas.uchile.cl/) at the University of Chile, in a hybrid relationship between the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Mines. I am a scientist looking for challenges in engineering, biology, physics, mathematical modelling, and geostatistics. I like to promote initiatives of scientific diffusion and early education, both scientific and technological, such as the [Micromundo Innitiave](https://micromundo.team/) an its [Virtual Microscopy](https://micromundo.app/)
 
My work and research
======

I love science, mathematics and nature. 

In the last 15 years I have had the opportunity to work in multi-disciplinary teams, where I have learned to be a contribution and recognize myself as part of a much larger whole. I have had the opportunity to enrich myself with the knowledge, experience, creativity and perseverance of a very wide range of people. Currently I am dedicated more to characterization problems of high dimension data in the estimation of industrial process variables, keeping a focus on the latest trends in Deep learning and stochastic and Bayesian modeling.

Various laboratories, places and researchers have left a strong impression on my research and my approach to science:

------
Reconstruction of geological structures from sparse samples, Optimal sampling strategies for advanced sampling. Geometalurgical estimation from hyperspectral data. 

Medical and Biomedical Applications
------
Medical Informatics, Haptic technology, Artroscopic Training by virtual reality and haptic feedback. 

Biological, Optical and Microscopic Applications
------
Optical Twezzers, Superresolution Microscopy, Mathematical Modelling in Developmental Biology of zefrafish, Topology and Visualization of 3D microscopic models.

My origins
======
I come from the south of Chile, where I grew up on a hill a bit isolated from civilization but surrounded by nature, cliffs, forests and beaches.

I received my PhD from the School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Chile, my double Diploma in Medical Informatics from the University of Chile and the University of Heidelberg, and my B.Sc. in electronic civil engineering at the Universidad de Concepción in Concepción, Chile. The campus of the University of Concepción is also surrounded by nature.

I also have industrial technical training in electronics at the High Technology Educational Center [CEAT](https://www.ceat.cl/inicio/), located in San Pedro de la Paz and surrounded by a lagoon and a small hill.
