Hi! I'm Chris, a data analyst in the [AJ Drexel Autism Institute](https://drexel.edu/autisminstitute/). I work under [Elizabeth McGhee Hassrick](https://drexel.edu/autisminstitute/about/our-team/all-staff/Elizabeth-McGhee-Hassrick/), where we study the social networks of Autism.

My contribution to our lab is based around handling our data in a way that is secure, accurate, concise, and reproducible. To achieve that goal, we employ Qualtrics for collecting most of our data and then I write R programs that analyze those data as they come in to monitor them for quality. Once data is collected, I write R programs to take the data from raw to publication.
