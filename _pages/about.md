I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at University of Southern California, where I conduce research under the advisement of Dr. Anthony Piro as a USC-Carnegie Fellow. My research focuses on using semi-analytic and numerical modeling of supernova light curves to improve out understanding of the connections between observable light curve features and properties of the progenitor star. The field of astronomy is about to see a several order of magnitude increase in the number of supernova detections per year as new surveys start to come online. To prepare us for the massive influx of data and observations of unique objects, my work contriutes important tools for understanding late-stage stellar evolution. 


Transitioning Into the Field of Data Science 
======
I will be completing my degree in May 2024 and am preparing to transition into the world of data science. While I have loved and am deeply grateful for my time as an astronomy student, I have been motivated to put my skills towards solving problems here on Earth due to the global unrest that has been the backdrop of my graduate career. I am confident that the critical thinking and problem solving skills I have developed during my PhD have prepared me to move into a number of industries within the climate and sustainability space. I am working to expand my skillset to prepare me for this transition through a number of hands-on courses exploring topics in machine learning, SQL querying, statistical analysis, and more. See my portfolio for more information. 

Science Communication
------
I firmly believe that science is for everyone and as a society we should be striving for improved scientific literacy for all. I have participated in a number of public outreach programs to bring science to K-12 students across the country through public talks and demonstrations, virtual classroom visits, pen-pal programs, and more. Organizations that I have partnered with include [Skype-a-Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/) and [Letters to a Pre-Scientist](https://prescientist.org/).
