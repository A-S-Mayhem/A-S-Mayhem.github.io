Hi there! I am Fazilet, a first-year PhD student at the University of Cambridge. I have a special interest in machine learning implementations for signal processing problems, more specifically image processing problems. I also enjoy following the developments in communications technologies. 

I have been involved in two different research projects so far. One is about molecular communications, where we designed a novel molecular communications system. In the end, we published the results in IEEE-TMBMC. The other is for my master's dissertation, which is on the super-resolution (SR) problem. I implemented different SR techniques and analyzed the results from a signal processing perspective (For details, visit [Projects](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/projects/)).

In addition to my research experiences, I have also worked as a freelance software engineer from February until October 2020. During this period, I have developed a mobile app using image hashcoding algorithms as well as creating custom widgets within Kivy framework in Python.


I am a female electronics engineer from Turkey, who don't really like being addressed as Mr Gokbudak! Except for Turkey, I have lived in Germany for around seven months as a summer school and exchange student. Also, I studied my master's in the UK at the University of Edinburgh. You can find my educational experiences about these countries in [Blog Posts](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/year-archive/).

Welcome to my website!
