I am a PhD Candidate in Public Administration at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/">Maxwell School</a> at Syracuse University.

My **research** focuses **on the effects of policies on the development and deployment of technologies needed to accelerate energy transitions**, particularly in the area of grid modernization and renewable energy integration. I am is also interested in the distributional implications of renewable energy policies such as feed-in-tariffs, renewable portfolio standards and net metering.

My main research fields are **environmental policy** and **policy process**.
