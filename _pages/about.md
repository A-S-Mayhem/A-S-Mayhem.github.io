Hello!

My name is Taylor Johnson and I am a graduating senior mechanical engineer at the University of Florida and a thermal sciences R&D intern at Sandia National Labs' National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF). My work focuses on developing scalable, cost-effective energy storage systems to support a renewable-powered future. I specialize in high-temperature thermal energy storage (TES), alternative hydrogen production, and machine learning applications for energy sustainability.

With hands-on experience at U.S. Department of Energy national labs and collaborations with startups and global research teams, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to renewable energy innovation. Beyond advancing technology, I am committed to addressing climate change impacts directly, from tackling water scarcity in the Peruvian Andes to partnering with Native American communities on sustainable energy solutions. My goal is to create equitable, empowering solutions that drive systemic change in energy access.
