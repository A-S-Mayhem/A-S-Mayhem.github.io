My name is Karthik Srinivasan and I am a fourth year Ph.D. Student in the Management Information Systems (MIS) department, Eller College of Management at University of Arizona. My Ph.D. advisor is Professor Sudha Ram. 

I am interested in healthcare data analysis and digital health. My current research is focused on addressing two independent problems - human stress/well-being modeling and studying impact of disease co-morbidity on patient health outcomes.

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, you can email me at karthiks@email.arizona.edu.
