Hello! I am Maitrayee Ghosh, currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Stanford University and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. 
I am a Physical Chemist who specializes in computational modeling of materials. I rigorously use density-functional theory based molecular dynamics simulations to probe materials along with machine-learning in extreme conditions. My current research interests span in materials science, planetary sciences and astrochemistry.
