I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Cornell University, starting this fall.
Previously, I was a master's student in 'Stochastics and Data science' at the University of Turin and a [Senior Allievo at Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/education/allievi-honors-program/), where I was supervised by prof [Stefano Favaro](http://sites.carloalberto.org/favaro/). My master thesis was about Bayesian Nonparametric cardinality estimation from Sketched Data. 
I obtained my B.sc. in Statistics at the University of Bologna, where I was supervised by [Christian Hennig](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/christian.hennig/).
