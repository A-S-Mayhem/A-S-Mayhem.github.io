I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh researching representation learning for deep reinforcement learning. 
I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Amos Storkey](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/) 
and a member of the [Bayesian and Neural Systems](https://www.bayeswatch.com/) group.

Prior to my PhD research, I completed my bachelor's in economics at the University of North Texas 
and my master's in artificial intelligence at Northwestern University. Additionally, I was a visiting researcher
at the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/) under the advisement of 
[Professor Stefano Albrecht](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/).
