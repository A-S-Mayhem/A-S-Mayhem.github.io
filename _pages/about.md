I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the UChicago Department of [Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/). My current advisor is [Wendy Freedman](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/wendy-l.-freedman/). 

I was an undergrad at [Penn](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/), where I worked with [Gary Bernstein](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/gary-bernstein) on developing statistical techniques for reconstructing information from galaxy and lensing surveys. I graduated with a B.A. in Physics in 2019.
