# About Me

I'm a junior-year undergraduate student at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) majoring in Robotic Engineering and Mathematics. Currently, I am conducting research on multiple robotic and computer vision topics: 3D Point Cloud Completion, FDM Printing Soft Robotics, Robotic Task Motion Planning, and Medical Assistive Automation. My research works are supervised by Prof. [Ziming Zhang](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/zzhang15) at [VISLab@WPI](https://zhang-vislab.github.io/), Prof. [Markus Nemitz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/mnemitz) at [RMG](https://wp.wpi.edu/roboticmaterialsgroup/), and Prof. [Christopher Julius Nycz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/cjnycz) at [AIM Lab](http://aimlab.wpi.edu/).

# News

I am actively exploring opportunities for a visiting researcher position in the summer of 2024, as well as a Ph.D. student position for the fall of 2025.

# Research Vision

My long-term research vision is to build automation systems that can be self-adaptive to new environments based on perception and learn concepts from logistics reasoning. These systems will assist humans to accomplish challenging tasks in the physical world.
