Hello! I am Rachael Phillips, a Senior Consultant for Microsoft Consulting Services in the Azure Cloud and Artificial Intelligence realm based in Northern California! I am a Data and Analytics Consultant by training with a masters in Mathematics from San Francisco State University. My research, teaching and tutoring experience, and service to my clients are founded off the idea that data is a tool to build up and improve our personal lives, our business lives and everything in between! 

My Work Experience
======
For the past 5+ years, I have helped numerous clients improve their businesses by implementing solutions in Azure Cloud Services for a multitude of purposes. These include projects for predictive maintenance, forecasting time series, document classification, speech to text analysis, migrating on-prem data to the cloud, business intelligence reports, text comparison, etc. These projects included many technologies, but I have worked mainly with the Azure stack. I enjoy learning new technologies, as well as helping my clients! 

My Background and History
======
I received my masters of arts degree in Mathematics at San Francisco State University in 2016. During that time, I wrote my thesis on [Relating gene expression profiling to copy number changes with different sub-types of breast cancer] (https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/concern/theses/x920fz53t). 
Since then, I have went from an Associate Consultant to Consultant to a Senior Consultant with 3 different consulting firms until I reached Microsoft, my current company.
