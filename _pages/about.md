I am a 3rd year PhD in Economics student at [Univeristy of California San Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu). 


My research interests are in behavioral and experimental economics with a focus on social learning, misspecified models and discrimination. I also work on topics related to student mental health and peer group support for online tutors.
