I am a *Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiter* (Scientific Researcher) and a first-year Ph.D. student under the guidance of [Prof. Kristina Yordanova](http://stenialo.org/about-me/) at the Institute of Data Science, University of Greifswald. 

In my doctoral research, I strive to understand the vulnerabilities and risks associated with large language models, such as biases, misinformation propagation, and unintended consequences. Through multidisciplinary approaches, I intend to explore techniques to enhance model security, address privacy concerns, and ensure that AI systems respect ethical norms and human rights.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a research assistant at the University of Rostock, where I delved into Neural Density Estimation for the project [NEISS](https://www.neiss.uni-rostock.de/en/). I also had the opportunity to hone my skills as a Software Engineer at PLANET AI, where I contributed to the development and testing of [Intelligent Document Analysis](https://planet-ai.de/products/ida/) software.
