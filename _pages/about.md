Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Princeton University, where I work in[ SSR](https://ssr.princeton.edu/) lab with Prof. [Radhika Nagpal](https://www.radhikanagpal.org/). My research focuses on building small and multifunctional robotic platforms and utilizing them to investigate biomechanisms and explore collective intelligence. Currently, I am working on understanding the hydrodynamics and swarm formation within fish schools, achieved through the use of an underwater robotic platform called BlueSwarm.


Before Princeton, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2022, advised by Prof. [Amit Lal](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/amit-lal) at Cornell University. My doctoral research focused on developing novel actuators and power supplies for the insect-sized robotic platform. Prior to that, I obtained a M.S. in Applied Physics from Cornell University and a B.S. in Physics from Beijing Normal University.
