Hi! Welcome to my home on the web. I'm Alberto, a renaissance man. I have too many interests, and they converge into one belief: the search for truth is a multifaceted task. Sciences and humanities have equal dignity and complementary functions for the quest.

Background and History
======
I have a degree in physics and a master's in statistics. I started my career as an actuary. I moved into consulting, where I learned to build and manage machine learning products for enterprise clients. I started a few companies (a couple still running, but not massive successes). These remarkable experiences taught me a lot more about management, people, teams, customers, and products than any business school. I freelanced a bit as a data scientist and product manager while going to grad school. In fact, I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the [CAMeL Lab](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/computational-approaches-to-modeling-language-lab.html).
Recently I took on a new challenge working at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com), building something new I can't really tell much about.
With the burning desire to deflate the excessive confidence modern humans have in tech and artificial intelligence, I authored the book _The Ethics of AI: Facts, Fictions, and Forecasts_.
