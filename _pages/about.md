My name is Jingwu Tang(唐静吾). I am a third-year student at Turing Class, Peking University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xiaotie Deng. During Spring 2021, I am pleased to have worked closely with Zhe Feng. My research interest broadly lies in the intersection between economics, computer science and machine learning. Most recently, I've been thinking about how to design better mechanisms through machine learning approaches.
