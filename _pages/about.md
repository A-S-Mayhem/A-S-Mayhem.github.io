Hello I am Zach Mackin!

I am a Senior studying Statistics and Computer Science at the [University of California Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). My research interests are centered upon High-Dimensional Data Analysis, Interpretable Deep Learning, Forecasting, and Physics Informed Deep Learning. I most recently have done research with the [Center for Human Sleep Science](https://www.humansleepscience.com/). I am currently a Data Engineer Intern on the Public Safety Power Shutoff team at [PG&E](https://www.pge.com/).

I have done research in a multitude of areas such as exploring a country's risk of defaulting with the [Economist Intellingence Unit](https://eiu.com),  accounting for growth in pollution within the Chesapeake Bay with the [Chesapeake Legal Alliance](https://chesapeakelegal.org), and effectively developing UAVs with [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).

Additionally, I have extensive teaching experiences within Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Data Science courses.
