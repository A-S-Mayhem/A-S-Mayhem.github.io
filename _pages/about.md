I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I work at the intersection of materials science and machine learning. expertise in applying machine learning models in solving complex materials problems. My deep learning models on the prediction of laser absorption for synchrotron x-ray images create a new pathway for process-control and a real-time monitoring system of laser-based additive manufacturing. 

I am expected to graduate in May 2023 and is currently actively seeking Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) and Data Scientist (DS) positions. I am highly skilled in materials science, statistics, machine learning and software engineering. I am excited to bring my expertise and passion to companies where I can continue to learn and make meaningful impacts.

Research Interests
------
* Synchrotron x-ray imaging of laser-matter characterization for failure analysis and quality control
* Automation and machine learning for image analysis
* Applied deep learning and data science
