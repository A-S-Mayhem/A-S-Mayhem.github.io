I'm a Ph.D. candidate studying machine learning at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) under Prof. [Maciej Mazurowski](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowski/). My research is primarily in deep learning for medical image analysis, in topics such as domain adaptation, image translation and generation, and anomaly detection. Additionally, I am drawn to understanding deep learning and medical image analysis from a scientific and foundational perspective. I have also worked as a research intern in the Math, Stats, and Data Science Group at [PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/).

See my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=a9rXidMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for a full list of my publications, with a few recent papers highlighted in the section below.

I graduated from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) in 2020 with degrees in Astrophysics and Mathematics, where my research with [Prof. Daniel Reichart](https://www.danreichart.com/) focused on the development of statistical techniques for astronomical data applications. I have been an educator in machine learning, physics, math and astronomy [in the academic setting](https://nickk124.github.io/teaching/) and [beyond](https://nickk124.github.io/outreach/).
