Hi! I am a first-year doctoral student in [School of Information](https://ischool.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I am advised by Drs. [Ahmer Arif](https://ahmerarif.com/), [Angela Smith](https://angeladrsmith.com/), and [Kenneth Fleischmann](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/people/people-details?PersonID=220). In the past, I have worked and been mentored by Drs. [Rebecca Neri] (https://ucla.academia.edu/RebeccaNeri), [Norman Su] (https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~normsu/), and [Phoebe Wakhungu](https://education.indiana.edu/about/directory/profiles/wakhungu-phoebe.html) on amazing projects in education and accessibility. I am a mixed-methods researcher who focuses on human-centered design of technology and learning environments that meets the need of marginalized voices.

I obtained my B.Eng. in Information Technology from University of Mumbai, followed by M.S. in Data Science and M.Ed. in Learning Sciences with generous funding from [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) School of Education. 

Below is an up-to-date list of my co-authored publications.
