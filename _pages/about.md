My name is Taylor Grimm and I am a first year PhD student in Statistics at Baylor University. I graduated in 2021 from Brigham Young University with my B.S. in Statistical Science and a minor in mathematics.

While at BYU, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant for a year working on Bayesian models for estimating elemental profiles of pollution source profiles and their contributions at various locations.

Currently, I am a graduate assistant helping with the development of a multi-day data science workshop for professionals in the water/wastewater treatment industry.
