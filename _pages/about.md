I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Yale University. I specialize in comparative and international political economy with a particular focus on foreign aid.  I also work on the politics of technology and international status. 

Prior to starting the PhD, I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Kosovo. I have a Master's in English literature and a very cute cat. 

You can read about my work cofounding the <a href="https://gsipe-workshop.github.io/">Greaudate Student International Political Economy (GSIPE) workshop</a> with <a href="https://www.alexanderkirss.com/">Alex Kirss</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/paulko/home">Paul Ko</a> in <a href="https://cobrienudry.github.io/files/ps_gsipe.pdf">PS: Political Science and Politics</a>.
