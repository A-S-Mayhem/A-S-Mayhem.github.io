About Me
======
I am a robotics engineer with 5 years of experience using machine learning and optimisation techniques for the development of robot morphologies and controllers. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working under the supervision of Professor Dario Floreano in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. I am a contributor to the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (MERGING). I was previously a PhD candidate in the Soft Robotics Group at the University of Bristol, supervised were Professor Helmut Hauser and Professor Jonathan Rossiter.
