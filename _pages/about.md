I am Mohammad Sediq Abazari, a Computer Engineering graduate specializing in Computer Networks from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, one of Iranâ€™s top five universities. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Software Engineering from Bojnourd University, where I graduated with an A GPA.

My research interests include Communication Systems, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Intent-Based Networking. For my Master's thesis, I focused on predicting power consumption in networks using machine learning techniques, contributing to the field of intent-based networking.

I have two years of professional experience at SunAir Research Institute, where I worked on the simulation and implementation of drone communication systems and applied machine learning algorithms to optimize network performance and power prediction.

With a strong passion for computer science, I am committed to advancing technology in intelligent communication networks and AI-driven solutions.
