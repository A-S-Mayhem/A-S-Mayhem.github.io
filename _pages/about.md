I am currently a 6th year Ph.D candidate in Molecular and Cell Biology at Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, MD. I am in the lab of Dr. Rachel Cox, working to elucidate the function of the mitochondria-associated, ribonucleoprotein Clueless and its role in mitochondrial function and translation in Drosophila. My anticipated graduation date is December 2021 - January 2022. This section is a work in progress, but please take a look at my featured publications and talks in the meantime!
