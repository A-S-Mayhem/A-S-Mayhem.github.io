I use numerical methods to understand geodynamic processes within the solid Earth across different temporal and spatial scales. I have built subduction frameworks to understand the tectonic and rheological origin of extensional structures, e.g., rifting, opening, and spreading seafloor, developed within the overriding plate. These numerical models (presented in the '[Research](https://zhibinlei.github.io/research/)' page) investigate - but are not restricted to - the role of high trench retreat rate, multiple slab subduction (dual inward dipping subduction), and inherited lateral lithospheric heterogeneities, in governing the strain localisation (plate weakening processes) that occur within the overriding plate during subduction. A synoptic summary of these findings can be found in my [PhD thesis](https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/152759/1/2022leizphd.pdf) (Figure 6.2).

The computational modelling framework is built with [Fluidity](https://github.com/FluidityProject/fluidity) (Davies et al., 2011; Kramer et al., 2021, 2012), an open-source, finite-element, control-volume code with adaptive mesh. The temperature and mantle flow velocity is modelled by solving the coupled incompressible Stokes and energy equations in the Boussinesq approximation using Fluidity.

Research interests

high resolution, adaptive meshes, thermal modelling

Fluidity, G-ADOPT

In the long run, I am interested in incorporating melting, and its role in altering the rheology, creating magmatism in the convective mantle and the overlying lithosphere. In paticular,  in the mantle wedge.
intraplate 

thermo-chemico-mechanical processes

In the long run, I am interested in incorporating melting and its role in impacting the rheology, magmatism, and interaction between the convective mantle and overlying lithosphere. 
In my research, I enjoy working across disciplines, linking seismology with geodynamics and mineral physics, as well as combining insights with zoologists and geologists. Much of my research is hypothesis driven, often combining data, forward and inverse modelling, with a strong emphasis on data uncertainties.
I've used coupled models of io's tidal heating, mantle magnetism and lithospheric volcanism to investigate io's structural, thermal and (compositional) evolution.
