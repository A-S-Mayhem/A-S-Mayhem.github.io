I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at [Offroad Robotics](https://offroad.engineering.queensu.ca/), [Ingenuity Labs](https://ingenuitylabs.queensu.ca/) at Queen’s University, Canada. I am passionate about robotics and a big believer that intelligent robots will play a significant role in our daily lives. I am interested in technologies that improve the autonomy of robotic systems, especially a combination of model-based and learning-based methods to achieve a high-performance robot interaction with real-world, dynamic, unstructured environments safely and effectively. I am strongly motivated to conduct researches in robot learning. How to integrate learning based modules to physical model-based robotic architecture appropriately? 

I received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering, specializing in robotics control, from the University of Calgary, Canada. The research focused on locomotion mode selection and motion planning of a leg-tracked quadrupedal robot. By proposing an energy criterion-based approach, locomotion mode transitions between tracked and legged locomotion to negotiate steps were achieved automatically. Prior to joining the Offroad Robotics group, I worked as a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Calgary and York University. I developed and implemented perception solutions for micro aerial vehicles including visual SLAM and CNN-based object detection and tracking.
