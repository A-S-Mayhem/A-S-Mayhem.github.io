I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the ECE Department at the University of Waterloo. Prior to joining the University of Waterloo, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the ECE Department at Queenâ€™s University. I develop algorithms that combine the high performance of machine learning with the theoretical guarantees of stability and safety of model-based control. I focused on applying machine learning techniques to dynamic modeling and control for autonomous systems. My research goal is to improve the performance and safety of robotic systems in dynamic and uncertain environments.

I received my PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in robotics control, from the University of Calgary, Canada. The research focused on locomotion mode selection and motion planning of a leg-tracked [quadrupedal robot](https://jiewang.name/publications/arXiv2019/). After that, I worked as a Postdoc Fellow at the University of Calgary. I developed and implemented perception solutions for drones including [visual SLAM](https://jiewang.name/publications/slam2019) and CNN-based multi-object detection and [tracking](https://jiewang.name/publications/rsmdpi2019). 

**Recent News:**

[April, 2023](https://youtu.be/s5qTAvRGYIo): One major limitation of the submitted works is that the data used for modeling human-driven vehicles was collected in a human-in-the-loop simulator, which may not fully capture real-world driving conditions. To overcome this limitation, we are currently collecting data through field experiments, which will improve the quality of our models and enhance their applicability in real-world settings. A preliminary field experiment video is available for viewing at [Field Experiment Data Collection for Human-Driven Vehicle Modeling](

[March, 2023](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=BI7jiWQAAAAJ): Two papers, focused on developing learning-based models for human-autonomous vehicle interaction to enhance safety in mixed-vehicle platooning control, have been submitted to [IROS2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04665) and [RA-L](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09452). The codes can be accessed at [GP-MPC-of-Platooning](https://github.com/CL2-UWaterloo/GP-MPC-of-Platooning). 

[Jan. 31, 2023](https://jiewang.name/publications/GP-FBLMPC2022/): The GP-FBLMPC [Paper](https://jiewang.name/publications/GP-FBLMPC2022/) has been accepted by the Journal of Field Robotics. What a great trip!

[July. 04, 2022](https://jiewang.name/publications/simulator2022/): "How to pick a mobile robot simulator: A quantitative comparison of CoppeliaSim, Gazebo, MORSE and Webots with a focus on accuracy of motion" [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2022.102629) was accepted. This is my first time to supervise graduate students publishing papers as a corresponding author!
