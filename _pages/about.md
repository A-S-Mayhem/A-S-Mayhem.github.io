I am a Data Scientist at Deloitte Canada. I completed a degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Toronto and have worked on projects in both Data Science and Applied Mathematics. Most recently I was working with a group of researchers at RiskLab developing machine learning models for Portfolio Optimization. 

This website is still a WIP. Why are you here??
