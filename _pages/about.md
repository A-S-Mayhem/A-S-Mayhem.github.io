I ([name audio](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/name.m4a)) am a computational sociologist studying social movements, politics, organizations, and inequality. I received my Sociology PhD in 2020 from the University of Arizona. I am working as an Assistant Professor of [Sociology](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/sociology//people/faculty/Zhang.php) and [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/) at Stony Brook University. 

My work combines statistical, network, and computational methods with large-scale datasets to study social, political, and organizational behavior. My work has been published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/jomf.12419.pdf), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [International Journal of Comparative Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1177/0020715219837752), [American Journal of Sociology](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/Fiel-Zhang-2019_AJS.pdf), and [PLoS One](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/pone.pdf).

My ongoing work focuses mainly on understanding the polarization and segregation in the U.S. society. I am using big data from FEC with corp data to track the polarization trend in corp America. I am using population mobility data from [SafeGraph](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns) and Facebook to assess the long-term impact of racial segregation on population mobility. I am also using deep learning methods to detect and monitor anti-AAPI hate speech and incidents (a direct result of polarization and xenophobia) from Twitter since the COVID-19 outbreaka.
