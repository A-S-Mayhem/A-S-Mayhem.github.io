I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science at University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/). I am co-advised by Professor [Bistra Dilkina](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Dilkina/Bistra) and Professor [Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/index.html).

In 2019, I received my B.E. in computer science from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University.

In May-December 2022, I was a research scientist intern at [Meta AI, FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/), where I worked closely with [Benoit Steiner](http://bsteiner.info/) and [Yuandong Tian](https://yuandong-tian.com/). 
In Summer 2021, I was a research scientist intern at Amazon Robotics where I worked with [Vikas Shivashankar](https://sites.google.com/site/vikshiv1987/).
In Spring 2018, I was a research intern at Carneige Mellon University advised by Professor [Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/).
In Summer 2018, I was a research intern at The University of Hong Kong advised by Professor [Zhiyi Huang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/).

My research interests lie in artificial intelligence, with a focus on multi-agent systems, combinatorial optimization, machine learning, computational game theory and computational sustainability.

## News
* \[2023.02\] Our paper with Amazon Robotics on solving large scale planning problems in automated warehouses is accepted to [ICAPS-2023](https://icaps23.icaps-conference.org/). I also presented this [work](http://idm-lab.org/wiki/AAAI23-MAPF/index.php/Main/HomePage?action=download&upname=Paper_12.pdf) at [AAAI-23 Workshop on Multi-Agent Path Finding](http://idm-lab.org/wiki/AAAI23-MAPF/index.php/Main/HomePage).
* \[2023.01\] [Our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08183.pdf) with [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) on applying large neighborhood search to solve integer linear programs is accepted to [CPAIOR-2023](https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2023/home). We discovered a simple yet effective destroy heuristic based on the LP relaxation of Local Branching. 
* \[2022.08\] I started a new position as a student researcher at [Meta AI, FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/).
* \[2022.07\] I presented my work with Amazon Robotics on [Deadline Aware Multi-Agent Tour Planning](https://hsi-workshop.github.io/hsi-2022-camera-ready/Deadline-Aware_Multi-Agent_Tour_Planning.pdf) at [HSI Workshop 2022 (in conjunction with IJCAI-ECAI 2022)](https://hsi-workshop.github.io/program.html).
* \[2022.05\] Undergrad student Shuyang Zhang, that I co-advised with [Jiaoyang Li](https://jiaoyangli.me/), won the USC Outstanding CS Undergraduate Research Award. We published a paper at SoCS-22 on learning priority orders for agents in path planning. 
* \[2022.04\] My research on Enhancing Seismic Resilient Water Pipe Network is selected for oral presentation at the Fourteenth Annual Annenberg Graduate Fellowship Research and Creative Project Symposium. Only six submissions were selected!
* \[2022.03\] I passed the Qualification Exam and now I am a Ph.D. candidate!
* \[2021.12\] Our paper on ML-guided large neighborhood search for MAPF is accepted to [AAAI 2022](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-22/).
