Hello,

I am Rute Correia, a Communication PhD student at ISCTE-IUL.

My thesis explores the intersection between community radio and open source - how open source methodologies can serve as a model for the sustainable development of such structures. On top of these two fields, my research (and personal) interests revolve around the [open movement](http://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/open-movement/), open content and copyleft, digital rights and activism, participatory social structures, radio art and experimental forms of radio production.

This pages is currently under construction.

Radio work
------

I am also an experienced radio person, having presented and produced various shows and features, as well as managed music and communication departments at different stations. I currently host and produce the morning show at [Oxig√©nio 102.6](http://oxigenio.fm/).

For nearly a decade, I have been hosting and producing [White Market Podcast](https://www.whitemarketpodcast.eu/), an advocate podcast about free music and free culture.
