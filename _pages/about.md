I am a second-year PhD student in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I am advised by Francesco Bullo. I was awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in Spring 2021. My research interests lie the analysis and control of nonlinear network systems with applications to neural networks, neuroscience, and multi-robot networks. In Spring 2020, I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Maryland (UMD). While at UMD, I worked with Yancy Diaz-Mercado on multi-robot coverage control and its applications. 

While an undergraduate student at UMD, I worked internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, MIT Lincoln Lab, and The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. I have also served as a tutor for differential equations, teaching fellow for engineering dynamics, and teaching assistant for calculus I and II. 

Outside of academics, I am a competitive chess player and chess expert, with a US Chess Federation rating of 2142. As an amateur, I enjoy running, juggling, listening to rock music, and practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I plan to run an ultramarathon (50 miles) in early 2022.
