I am a Professor at the Department of Communication, Michigan State University (MSU).

My current research interest includes computational social science, health communication, mobile analytics, and political communication. I am particularly interested in unraveling the structure & dynamics of human communication phenomena with various computational methods (e.g., network and spatial modeling, text mining, temporal and sequential modeling).

I am now serving as the Associate Editor of the Journal of Communication (2022-). Meanwhile, I serve on the editorial board of several peer-reviewed journals in communication research, including: 
* Computational Communication Research
* Communication Methods and Measures
* Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media
* Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication

I am a research affiliate of 
* Web Mining Lab and Center for Communication Research (CCR) at City University of Hong Kong (CityU)
* Health & Risk Communication Center (HRCC) and Quello Center at MSU

I was the founding member and inaugural chair (2016-2017) of the Computational Methods Interest Group (elevated to the Computational Methods Division in 2020) at the International Communication Association.
