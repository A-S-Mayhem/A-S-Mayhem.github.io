Dear reader, I am a PhD student at Sorbonne University working with the [DELYS](https://team.inria.fr/delys/) team in LIP6/Inria in Paris. Previously i was with the [AGPL](https://pl.cs.uni-kl.de/homepage/en/) team in TU Kaiserslautern where I did my Master's thesis on [AntidoteDB](https://www.antidotedb.eu). 

My primary area of research is Distributed Graph Systems. I am studying techniques to manage data consistency with threads working on irregular graphs in highly connected environments that allow fast synchronization primitives as well as in disconnected environments where synchronization is expensive.
