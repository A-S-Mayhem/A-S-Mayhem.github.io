I am a fifth year PhD student at Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was born in 1996. I received my B.S. degree in 2017 from the School of Computing， Wuhan University. My research interests include heterogeneous graph representation learning, construction and application of scientific and technological knowledge graphs, and domain-specific pre-training model.
