Welcome to my personal website. I am a Research Fellow in the [Meel group](https://meelgroup.github.io), at the School of Computing of the National University of Singapore. I am currently working on the development of new techniques for maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solving and for counting the number of satisfying assignments to Boolean formulae (model counting, or #SAT).

I recently defended [my dissertation](https://hdl.handle.net/1887/3455662), *Optimal decision-making under constraints and uncertainty*, at Leiden University (NL). Part of the research therein was conducted while I was a visiting researcher at Universit√© catholique de Louvain (BE) and the University of Toronto (CA).

If you would like to know more about my current position, research interests and achievements, please check out [my cv](http://www.annalatour.nl/cv/). You will find a list of code and publications on [this page](http://www.annalatour.nl/code-publications/).
