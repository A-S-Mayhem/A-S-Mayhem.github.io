About me
---
I'm a McDonnell International Scholar in the Neuroscience PhD Program at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm in [Kerschensteiner Lab](https://kerschensteinerlab.wustl.edu/), using two-photon imaging, multi-electrode array and computational modeling to study visual processing in the mouse and human retina. 

Before that, I was a visiting scholar in [Parvizi Lab](http://med.stanford.edu/parvizi-lab.html) at Stanford University. Earlier, I was a research assistant at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, National Central University in Taiwan. Earlier, I received my B.S.E. degree in Chemical Engineering from National Taiwan University.
