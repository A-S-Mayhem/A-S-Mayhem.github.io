Welcome !


I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Paris-Saclay University within [CIRED](http://www.centre-cired.fr/en/) and [PSAE](https://www6.versailles-grignon.inrae.fr/psae_eng/) research units. Here is my [CV](https://RomainFillon.github.io/files/CV_academique.pdf).

I work on climate change and I am particularly interested in climate tipping points and social preferences under risk and uncertainty.


Feel free to contact me : rfillon@protonmail.com !



Work in progress 
+ "Climate policy, ethics and the uncertain fate of the Amazon rainforest", with T. Gasser (IIASA), C. Guivarch (CIRED) & P. Ciais (LSCE, Paris-Saclay University).
+ "Optimal climate policy under tipping risk and temporal risk aversion", with C. Guivarch (CIRED) & N. Taconet (PIK). Draft available upon request!
