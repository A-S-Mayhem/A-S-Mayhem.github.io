I graduate with the highest distinction from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, earning a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics and Analytics with honors. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted an honor thesis focusing on the robustness analysis of Google's PageRank Centrality algorithm on Undirected Networks, under the supervision of Professor [Mariana Olvera-Cravioto](https://molvera.web.unc.edu/).

Currently, I work as a Data Engineer Intern at [Cmind Inc](https://www.cmind-ai.com/), a fintech startup in Boston, focusing on building, training, and refining machine learning models, notably boosting models, to classify and predict daily earnings surprises and consistently enhance model accuracy.

I'm broadly interested in data-related fields, with a particular interest in exploring cutting-edge statistical technologies including machine learning and natural language processing.
