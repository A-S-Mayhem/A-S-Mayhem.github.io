    <p>Welcome! I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the <strong><a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/phd-students/deivy-houeix">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT)</strong>. My research is in <strong>development economics and organizational economics</strong>, focusing on technology and firms in lower-income countries, particularly in West Africa.</p>
    <p>My dissertation explores how digital technologies reshape economic relationships and contract structures within and between firms, and uncovers the key drivers and barriers to their adoption.</p>    
    <p>Over the past eight years, I have conducted research projects in Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Senegal, and Togo. </p>

## Research Papers

1. Asymmetric Information and Digital Technology Adoption: Evidence from Senegal **(Job Market Paper)**, *Draft Coming Soon*
   <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary> 
        <div class="abstract-content">
            <p>The rise of digital technologies in the workplace can reduce information asymmetry and reshape employer-employee contracts: by making worker actions more observable, they help mitigate moral hazard. However, employees may resist adoption if they fear losing informational rent. I explore this trade-off through two field experiments, guided by contract theory, where I introduce digital payments to the Senegalese taxi industry in partnership with the country's leading payment company. In the first experiment, I randomize access to digital payments for drivers and, within this group, further randomize the extent to which transactions are observable by taxi owners (employers). I find that digital payments reduce drivers' cash-handling costs by about half and serve as effective monitoring tools for taxi owners. Greater transaction observability increases driver effort, induces a shift toward more efficient, salaried contracts, and increases the duration of the driver-owner relationships. However, 50% of drivers — primarily the least productive and poorest — decline to adopt when transactions are observable. The second experiment shows the adoption rate doubles when drivers are assured that payments will not be observable by the owners. I use the experimental variations and develop a theoretical framework to structurally estimate the welfare impacts of policy counterfactuals. I show that mandating technology adoption may reduce welfare, while removing payment observability boosts adoption but maintains moral hazard. My findings demonstrate that the information embedded in digital technologies can hinder their adoption when individuals within a firm have conflicting incentives for transparency, with important implications for both technology adoption and firm growth.

        <summary>Abstract</summary> 
        <div class="abstract-content">
            <p>I conduct a randomized experiment to study the nationwide technology diffusion of a new digital payment technology in Senegal. By leveraging two novel sources of network data—mobile money transactions and anonymized phone contact directories covering the near universe of the adult population in Senegal—I causally identify three sets of adoption spillovers from taxi firms randomized to receive early access to the technology: intra-industry among taxi firms; inter-industry between taxi drivers and other small businesses; and inter-regional spillovers from the capital city to businesses in other urban centers. I show that spillovers go beyond strategic complementarities, reflecting social learning within firms' social networks, driven by social ties and remote interactions.</p>

4. Relational Frictions Along the Supply Chain: Evidence from Senegalese Traders (with Edward Wiles), *Draft Coming Soon*
   <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary> 
        <div class="abstract-content">
            <p>Search and trust frictions have historically hindered the ability of small firms to access foreign input markets. We run a field experiment with 1,862 small garment firms in Senegal, in which we provide exogenous variation in search and trust frictions of interacting with suppliers in Turkey. Our search treatment connects firms to new suppliers using social media, and our two trust treatments vary the information about the types and incentives of these suppliers. To measure the impact on foreign market access, we mystery shop at all firms. Treated firms are 25% more likely to have the varieties the shopper requests and the goods supplied are 32% more likely to be high quality, driven by the search treatment. However, the trust treatments matter for longer-term outcomes: trust-treated firms are significantly more likely to develop these connections into relationships that persist beyond the study. These new relationships lead to increases in profit and sales, particularly among wholesalers.</p>

5. Financial Inclusion and Rural Electrification: Evidence from Togo (with Paul Brimble, Axel Eizmendi Larrinaga, and Toni Oki), *Draft Coming Soon*
   <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary> 
        <div class="abstract-content">
            <p>Despite recent advancements, most people in sub-Saharan Africa still lack electricity. While rural electrification has garnered policy attention, recent academic literature estimates low demand. We argue that high transaction and transport costs for paying electricity bills - a critical friction faced by rural households - partly explain this puzzle and weaken policy effectiveness. We examine the scattered rollout of two nationwide policies in Togo in 2019 to support this claim: a subsidy program for solar home systems and an expansion of mobile money agents. The subsidy, which nearly halved the price, doubled adoption rates, primarily among customers near mobile money agents. These customers could reduce their payment frequency and buy in bulk, due to lower baseline transaction costs. The follow-up mobile money agent expansion reduced transaction costs directly, leading to a decrease in payment frequency due to a large income effect. In this setting of high liquidity constraints, the ability to buy in bulk outweighed the benefits of cheaper consumption smoothing. Our findings highlight the complementary role of subsidies and financial inclusion in increasing access to essential services.</p>

   <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary> 
        <div class="abstract-content">
            <p>We introduce a novel approach for eliciting relative poverty rankings that aggregates partial orderings reported independently by multiple neighbors. We first identify the conditions under which the method recovers more accurate rankings than the commonly used Borda count method. We then apply the method to secondary data from rural Indonesia and to original data from urban Cote d’Ivoire. We find that the aggregation method works as well as Borda count in the rural setting but, in the urban setting, reconstructed rankings from both the pairwise and Borda count methods are often incomplete and sometimes contain ties. This disparity suggests that eliciting poverty rankings by aggregating rankings from neighbors may be more difficult in urban settings. We also confirm earlier research showing that poverty rankings elicited from neighbors are correlated with measures of poverty obtained from survey data, albeit not strongly. Our original methodology can be applied to many situations in which individuals with incomplete information can only produce a partial ranking of alternatives.</p>

## Selected Work in Progress

- Internal Migration, Remittances, and Networks: Evidence from Senegal (with Edward Wiles)
   <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary> 
        <div class="abstract-content">
            <p>We explore the relationship between internal migration, remittances, and financial and social networks in lower-income contexts, with a focus on Senegal. To establish new facts and causal evidence, we construct a unique dataset that links migration patterns to both remittance flows and social networks covering the near universe of Senegal's adult population, based on real-time GPS tracking of personal and business transactions and anonymized phone contact directories from the country’s largest mobile money provider. We use this dataset to document patterns of migration and remittance flows to a high degree of spatial and temporal precision, and to explore how financial and social networks affect — and are affected by — these patterns, especially in response to economic or environmental shocks.</p>

- Digitalization of Local Tax Collection in Côte d’Ivoire (with Pascaline Dupas)
   <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary> 
        <div class="abstract-content">
            <p>Low tax capacity hampers the ability of municipalities in Côte d’Ivoire, as in many other countries, to provide quality public services for their populations. We study the impacts of the nationwide rollout of a digital tax system, through which municipalities will move to entirely cash-less tax collection. We explore the impact on total tax revenue, size of the tax base, spending (including public good provision), and local government accountability.</p>
