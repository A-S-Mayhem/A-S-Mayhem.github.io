I am currently pursuing a PhD in the [Adaptive Brain Lab](https://www.abg.psychol.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Zoe Kourtzi](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/professor-zoe-kourtzi). I have broad research interests, working on the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and psychology.

I am an advisor to mental health startup [Neurum Health](https://www.neurumhealth.com).

During my MPhil, supervised by [Pascale Fung](http://www.ee.ust.hk/~pascale/), I was doing research on machine learning on non-numerical data, especially social signals. I was also working with [Genta Indra Winata](https://gentaiscool.github.io/) on a virtual therapist self-help platform. We were using machine learning to model affect state in order to construct emotionally intelligent dialogue.
