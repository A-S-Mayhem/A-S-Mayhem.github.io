Ezekiel Soremekun is a Research Associate at 
SnT- Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, 
at the University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg. 
Ezekiel's research is focused on software engineering (SE), especially software validation. 
This includes SE research areas such as automated debugging, software testing, 
program analysis, and security testing.
He is interested in studying both functional properties (e.g., correctness)
and non-functional properties (e.g., security, robustness, and fairness) of 
software systems, including aritificial intelligence (AI) -driven systems (e.g., automated classifiers).

Ezekiel's research objective is to apply scientific methods to validate software systems. 
Software systems have become increasingly complex, such that it is impossible to ensure their
correctness without systematic validation.

Ezekiel's over-arching research aim is to provide useful validation techniques, tools and empirical data for the following:
   * __Software Testing__: systematically exposing unexpected program behaviors, 
   * __Automated Debugging__: automatically diagnose, mitigate and repair such incorrect behaviors, 
   * __Human Factors in SE__: study developer behaviors during software testing and debugging activities, and 
   * __Human-in-the-loop SE__: build testing and debugging tools that account for developer behaviors and interactions in practice. 

The goal is to address these key challenge by developing methods and tools to support developers during testing and debugging activities.
