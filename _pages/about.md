I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Citrine Informatics](http://www.citrine.io), helping to build the world's largest materials informatics data platform backed by AI for materials discovery and optimization. My primary interests include machine learning, data products, and 
tools and methods at the intersection of data science and physical sciences.

I have a PhD in Physics from UC Santa Cruz, where my research focused on the design, fabrication, and analysis of semiconductor nanocrystal devices for next-generation energy conversion.
