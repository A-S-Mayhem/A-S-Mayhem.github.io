I am an numerical modeler and oceanographerï¼Œ my research focuses on the effects
of ocean surface waves on air-sea momentum and heat fluxes, and their influence
on the atmospheric boundary layer and extreme processes such as tropical cyclone.

I am the developer of the coupled model [FIO-AOW](https://github.com/Biao-Zhao/FIO-AOW)
With this coupled mode, the goal my research  is to better understand the air-sea-wave 
coupled processes and improve tropical cyclone and wind energy prediction.
