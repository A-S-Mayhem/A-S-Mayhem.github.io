As the Senior Archivist III, I provide leadership and direction for the Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center Archive's distinguished repository of manuscripts, photographs, audiovisual materials, and born-digital assets dating from the late 1800s to the present. My primary professional objective is to advance effective infrastructure and strategies for long-term digital collection management. As a committed archivist, educator, and collaborator, I have significantly contributed to the profession through my leadership, advocacy, and program development skills. 

As both a practitioner and educator, I can foster interdisciplinary collaborations and offer innovative concepts that bridge the gap between technology and collection management. As a collaborator, I strive to explore inclusive and inventive methods to broaden access to information. My academic qualifications include a master's degree in Library and Information Science (MLIS) with a specialization in Digital Content Management and a master's degree in Museum Science (M.S.) with a focus on Digital Asset Management. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information Science at the University of North Texas, concentrating on large-scale digital asset management.

Data-driven, Efficiency-Focused Research
======
My research focuses on the impact of information system components (data+human) and the ability to effectively process information (product) efficiently. My work centers on cultural heritage content/information management systems and workflow methodology. I am interested in the measurement of the rate and efficiency of information flow by exploring traditional goal and system models as well as forecasting models in conjunction to predict or prevent possible barriers and obstructions from subsystem to the end product.

Current Large-Scale Projects
======
The Carl Albert Center Archives, along with Harvard University and the University of Iowa, was awarded collaborative research grant funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the project ["Understanding the Evolution of Political Campaign Advertisements over the Last Century"](https://github.com/prys0000/political-commercial-collection-archives).

The [Congressional Portal Project](https://github.com/prys0000/congressional-portal-project/tree/main) provides a repository for workflows, methodologies, instructional materials, controlled vocabularies, and more. This repository was created to house large-scale project efficiency methodologies, and automated workflows, and to document strategies throughout the project timeline. The project scope focuses on materials relating to the American Congress from the Carl Albert Research and Studies Center Archives. 

The [Archives Handwriting Text Extraction and Analysis Project](https://github.com/prys0000/archives-handwriting-text-extract-project) was developed to create and test versatile text extraction and cleaning tools available through local applications or by AWS Textract. This flexibility allows the tools to align with a specific repository or project requirements, as well as facilitate local file processing and customization.
