Research Vision and Interest
======
I want to fascilitate deep learning and machine vision techniques to simplify the real world tasks and to find solutions to problems in areas like suspicious object detection, activity recognition, crypto currency, agriculture. Further I'm working on utilizing signal processing and machine vision in terms medical imaging to serve the medical community to fight against severe diseases such as cancers. Hence I'm interested in condicting my research on signal processing, machine vision, pattern recognition and algorith optimization techniques.
