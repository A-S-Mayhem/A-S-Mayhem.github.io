Larry Han is a PhD candidate in [Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at Harvard University, advised by Professor Tianxi Cai and Professor Lorenzo Trippa. He received an AM in Biostatistics from Harvard in 2020, an MPhil in Healthcare Operations from the University of Cambridge in 2018, an MA in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University in 2017, and a BSPH in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2016.

[His research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iZnTmxMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) focuses on developing novel statistical methods to leverage real world data to improve decision-making in public health and clinical medicine. Specifically, his academic interests include robust and efficient estimation and inference of treatment effects using large-scale data generated from electronic health records and clinical trial data.

His current research targets:
* Doubly robust estimators for evaluating surrogate markers on long-term outcomes in observational data. 
* Semi-supervised transfer learning algorithms to improve pragmatic trial efficiency when outcomes are captured using imperfect surrogates in electronic health records.
* Communication-efficient, federated learning algorithms that robustly estimate treatment effects in target populations under privacy constraints and site-heterogeneity.
* Principled approach for sensitivity analysis of design parameters in evaluating competing clinical trial designs.
* Applied projects in COVID-19, cardiology, dementia, HIV/STDs, and social innovation.

He enjoys playing golf (especially in his home state of North Carolina), reading history (especially biographies), and staying up-to-date with global affairs (especially US-China relations).
