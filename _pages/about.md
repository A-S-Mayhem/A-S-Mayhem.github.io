I am a <del>first</del> second year Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am advised by <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/orso/">Alex Orso</a> and <a href="http://vhellendoorn.github.io/">Vincent Hellendoorn</a>.

My research area is <a href="https://medium.com/@Kamel773/deep-learning-for-source-code-c1d652ab49fe">Deep Learning for Source Code</a>. More specifically, my research focus on developing algorithms that extract <em>less and higher quality data</em>, from extremely large dataset, to train deep leanring algorithms on source code for code understanding tasks to imporve the preformance of pre-trained models on a small real-world data.
