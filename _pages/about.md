I am a Junior Researcher at the World Bank in the ID4D team. I got my bachelor degree in economics at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP) and my Master degree in Quantitative Economics at the University of Munich. I worked as RA in the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition ([MPI](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/)), Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard ([LISH](https://lish.harvard.edu/people/alexander-quispe))  and MIT Sloan. My main fields of intereset are Labor Economics, Development and the intersection of Machine Learning and Causal Inference. 

## Causal Inference and Machine Learning Book
I am currently working in a [ Causal Inference and Machine Learning Bookdown](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/ml_book/), where we can see tutorials using R and Python. The main topics this book covers are: 

* Prediction/Inference with High Dimensional Linear Models
* Prediction in Modern Nonlinear Regressions (Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks)
* Randomized Control Trials
* Causal DAGs
* Double/debiased Machine Learning
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Trees
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Causal Forest
* Feature Engineering With Deep Learning for Causal and Predictive Inference
