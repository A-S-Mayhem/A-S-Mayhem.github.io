Hi! I am Luis Palomino. I am a Peruvian economist with an MA in Latino and Latin American Studies from [UConn](https://uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"}-[El Instituto](https://elin.uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include Regional Development, Regional Economics, Economic Geography, Urban Economics, Economic History, and Human Capital.

I am a Research Specialist/Economic Analyst at UConn and an Economic Consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). My work combines quantitative analysis, econometric modeling, and machine learning algorithms to generate insights for policy and research. I specialize in data innovation, leveraging satellite imagery, mobile phone data, news, and other unstructured data to create socioeconomic indicators with high spatial and temporal resolution.

I aspire to pursue a PhD in Economics or a related field at a program that aligns with my research interests. I aim to build an academic career dedicated to advancing research and contributing to evidence-based policymaking.
