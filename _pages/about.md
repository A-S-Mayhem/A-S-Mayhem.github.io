I'm currently a PhD student in Statistics at UBC working with [Dr. Daniel J. McDonald](https://dajmcdon.github.io/). My reasearch areas are nonparametric regression, convex optimization, and time series analysis. I started doing the PhD program in September, 2020. Before this, I had a MSc of Mathematics and Statistics Concentration in Statistics at Univeristy of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I did my undergraduate in Economic Statistics at Zhejiang University of Finance and Statistics, Zhejiang, China.
