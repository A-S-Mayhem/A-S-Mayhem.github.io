# About Me 🌿

Hi there! I'm Majid Rebouh, an exhibit technician with a passion for blending plant biology, technology, and AI to create innovative solutions for environmental restoration and education. 

## What I’m Interested In 🔎

I’m fascinated by the intersection of plant biology and technology, particularly in exploring how AI and robotics can be used to restore environments and foster sustainability. From building smart ecosystems to designing machines that mimic nature, I thrive on projects that bridge science and creativity.

## What I’m Working On 📝

### Raspberry Pi Voice-Activated LLM 🗣️
A personal assistant project using a Raspberry Pi and a large language model (LLM). This voice-activated system is designed to help streamline daily tasks and provide a conversational interface for technical queries.

### Terrarium 🪴
An intricately designed, self-sustaining terrarium that integrates sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and light levels, blending aesthetic appeal with functional technology.

### Machine Learning Planter
Using various environmental sensors like the DHT11, attaching them to a plant pot, I can allow a Raspberry Pi to store the data as I manually grow a plant. Soon, This data will be used to with a Regression Model to allow the Pi to grow a plant itself.

### Jansen Linkage Walker 🚙
An ESP32-powered robot that walks with legs (just like us!) using the famous Jansen linkage ratio.
