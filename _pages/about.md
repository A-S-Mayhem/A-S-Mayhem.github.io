Welcome! I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science, Emory University](https://www.cs.emory.edu/home/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Liang Zhao](https://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/). Previously, I received my master's degree in Statistics from George Washington University in 2020. I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [School of Mathematical Science, Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China in 2018. I previously worked as a research intern at [NEC Lab America](https://www.nec-labs.com/).

Research Interests
======
I am interested in designing **efficient, generalizable, and explainable learning algorithms with theoretical guarantees**. Specifically, my current research topics include but are not limited to **1.** Learning strategies for domain transfer problems, such as multi-task learning (MTL), domain adaptation (DA), and domain generalization (DG). **2.** Large-scale machine learning algorithms with better scalability and performance, such as distributed training for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and model compression & acceleration of LLMs, etc. **3.** Online learning such as continual/lifelong learning with memory replay and neuro-inspiration.
