Fábio's journey as scientist began in 2004 during their undergraduate studies at [UFAL](https://ufal.br/), Brazil. He received a scholarship for a research project focused on water flow analysis in rivers used for public water supply. During this project, he collected data, performed current-meter measurements, and developed MATLAB scripts to: (1) analyze velocity profiles and (2) calculate streamflow.

Continuing their academic pursuit, Fábio pursued a master's degree in Water Resources Engineering at [IPH/UFRGS](https://www.ufrgs.br/iph/), where he adapted [a hydrodynamic model](https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/bitstream/handle/10183/31775/000776822.pdf?sequence=1) with a water quality module to solve complex geometries using unstructured grids. This experience laid the foundation for their future work in model development.

As part of [his doctoral studies](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lup/publication/ee290910-cca7-46ec-b42d-9189fb3b7bcc), Fábio proposed and implemented changes in the BRAMS (Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modeling System) to estimate latent heat flux from vegetation to the atmosphere. He replaced the existing approach with the standardized Penman–Monteith equation, tailored to different crop types.

Building upon his expertise, Fábio joined the [Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University](https://oeb.harvard.edu/), where he modified the Ecosystem Demography (ED) Model. He introduced a river routing scheme to simulate overland flow along river networks.

He has worked with various models, accessing and manipulating different types of data files. He has mastered the use of external datasets as boundary conditions for regional models and utilized data visualization platforms to analyze large datasets efficiently.

Fábio has been teaching at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) (2015-2016) and [UFAL](https://ufal.br/) (2016-present) and successfully led research projects in collaboration with universities in Sweden and the USA.

He possesses a strong academic background, with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [UFAL](https://ufal.br/), a master's degree in Water Resources Engineering from the [Instituto de Pesquisas Hidráulicas](https://www.ufrgs.br/iph/), and a doctoral degree from [Lund University's Division of Water Resources Engineering](https://www.tvrl.lth.se/english/).
