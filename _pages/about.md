Hi, my name is Nicki and I do machine learning research. Currently I am a Postdoc at the [Section for Cognitive systems](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys) at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) where I work with Professor [SÃ¸ren Hauberg](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~sohau/). I consider myself a *jack of all trades, master of none* in machine learning and deep learning, having experience with computer vision, NLP, supervised models, generative models, reinforcement learning ect. Current research interest are in the intersection of generative models, uncertainty quantification and manifold learning. Additionally, I have a key interest in machine learning operations (MLOps), for which I teach a [course]https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops/() at DTU.

Furthermore, I am a core developer and maintainer of [pytorch lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning), where we develop open-source software to help researchers scale their models and experiments and not their boilerplate ;)

Feel free to contact me if you want to work with me :]
