I am an Economist in the Research Department of the [Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data). My research interests span urban, environmental, and development economics. I received my PhD in 2017 from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was advised by faculty in both the [Department of Economics](https://econ.ucsb.edu/) and the [Bren School](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/). My undergraduate degree is from the University of Texas at Austin, where I majored in Latin American History ([LLILAS](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/llilas/)) and Economics.
