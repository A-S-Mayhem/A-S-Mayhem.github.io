Hi! I am a Computer Vision and Robotics engineer, working on perception algorithms for autonomous vehicles at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/). I am passionate about developing algorithms and models for perceiving 3D structure from images.  I envision a world where computers can reason about the complex 3D environment from visual data, much like us humans. I enjoy working on problems at the intersection of geometry, optimization, and machine learning. 

<!-- Background
====== -->
I earned my Master's degree focusing on Computer Vision and Robotics from [Georgia Institute of Technology](gatech.edu), where I had the fortune of working with [Prof. Frank Dellaert](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/) and [Prof. Sonia Chernova](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~chernova/). As a student researcher, I contributed to SfM and SLAM algorithms in the [GTSAM library](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam). I also had the wonderful experience of working with the [RAIL lab](http://rail.gatech.edu/) and winning the [FetchIt! challenge](https://ic.gatech.edu/news/622859/georgia-tech-team-wins-new-fetch-robot-icras-fetchit-mobile-manipulation-challenge) at ICRA 2019. I spent the summer as a Computer Vision Intern at [Blue River Technology](https://bluerivertechnology.com/), which taught me a bit about agriculture.

Even before that, I was an undergrad at Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering in the beautiful city of Mysuru, which is also where I grew up. At the time, I was an IEEE volunteer and participated in many robotics challenges, which ultimately drew me closer to the field.
