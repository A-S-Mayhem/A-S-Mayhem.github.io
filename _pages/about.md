I am currently an Associate Technical Writer based in Scottsdale, Arizona at [Paradox](https://www.paradox.ai/), a company that reimagines the future of hiring and recruiting.

With a diverse background in technical writing for SaaS companies across various sectors—such as legal, financial, and healthcare—and experience in digital forensics as a sworn law enforcement professional, I always bring a unique perspective and skill set to my work. 

I'm passionate about working for values-driven tech companies. I believe technology can greatly improve people's lives, and I'm dedicated to writing about technology that achieves this goal.

During my early career, I'm always looking to upskill. I'm broadly interested in cloud computing, generative AI, user experience, cybersecurity, and API documentation.
