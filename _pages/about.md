I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Guoliang Fan](https://ceat.okstate.edu/ece/faculty/guoliang-fan.html) in the [School of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ceat.okstate.edu/ece/) of the Oklahoma State University (OSU). Before studying at OSU, I worked as a software testing engineer in China for seven years.

Research Interests
======
My research work is in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentric_vision}{egocentric vision}. The goal of my research is to enable wearable devices to perceive indoor scenes by developing novel computer vision algorithms for the automatic analysis of images and videos. As an educator, I instruct undergraduates in various electrical engineering topics and mentor graduate students in image processing research.

From the scientific point of view, we tackle fundamental open problems in computer vision research related to camera pose estimation and understanding of human actions and activities, objects, scenes, and events.

From the application perspective, we develop systems that solve practical world problems by introducing cutting-edge computer vision technologies into new application domains.


* Computer Vision: camera pose estimation, object recognition, scene understanding
* Wearable Computing: wearable cameras, smart glasses
* First Person Vision: perspective, healthcare 
* Machine Learning: deep learning, transfer learning
