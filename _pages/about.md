I am a NORDITA Fellow at the Nordita Institute and Stockholm University working on several aspects of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astrophysics, neutron stars, and transients more broadly. I did my PhD at Monash working under the supervision of Paul Lasky and Greg Ashton which was conferred in October 2021.
I am a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for gravitational-wave discovery, OzGrav.
