Ezekiel Soremekun is a Research Associate (Postdoctoral researcher) at 
the [SerVal Group](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/research/serval) 
(led by Prof. Dr. Yves Le Traon), 
[SnT](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt) 
-- Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, 
at the 
[University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu), Luxembourg. 

Professional Experience
-----------------------
Ezekiel was previously a researcher (and PhD candidate) at the [Software Engineering Group](https://andreas-zeller.info) 
(of Prof. Dr. Andreas Zeller) of 
[CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en) and a visiting researcher at the 
[ASSETS Group](https://asset-group.github.io) 
(of Prof. Dr. Sudipta Chattopadhyay) at 
[SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg). 

Education
---------
Ezekiel possesses a 
PhD in Software Engineering (2022) from 
[Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). 
He was also a graduate student (2013-2016) at the 
[Saarbr√ºcken Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de).
He also possesses an
MSc in Computer Science (2011) from 
[African University of Science and Technology](https://aust.edu.ng)
and a BSc in Software Engineering (2010) from
[American University of Nigeria](https://www.aun.edu.ng).



Research
-------------------
Ezekiel's research is primarily focused on **software engineering** (SE), especially **software validation**. 
This includes SE research concerns such as **automated debugging**, **software testing**, 
**program analysis**, and **security testing**. 
He is interested in studying both functional properties (e.g., correctness)
and non-functional properties (e.g., security, robustness, and fairness) of 
software systems, including aritificial intelligence (AI) -driven systems (e.g., automated classifiers). 

Ezekiel's research objective is to **apply scientific methods to validate software systems**. 
Software systems have become increasingly complex, such that it is impossible to ensure their
correctness without systematic validation. The main research goal is to address these key challenges 
by **developing methods and tools to support developers during software testing and debugging activities**.

The over-arching research aim is to provide useful validation techniques, tools and empirical data for the following:
   * __Software Testing__: *systematic generation of test inputs* to expose unexpected program behaviors, 
   * __Automated Debugging__: how to *automatically diagnose, mitigate and repair* incorrect program behaviors, 
   * __Human Factors in SE__: studying *developer behaviors* during software testing and debugging activities, and 
   * __Human-in-the-loop SE__: building testing and debugging tools that *account for developer behaviors, needs 
and interactions in software practice*.
