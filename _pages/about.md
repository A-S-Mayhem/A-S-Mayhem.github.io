I am now a PM managing AI/ML projects at Wistron. I received MBA and Master's in Information Systems dual degrees from University of Maryland, College Park and Bachelor's degree at National Tsing Hua University. Prior to University of Maryland, I was a Factory Project Manager at Pegatron, the largest OEM / ODM in Asia. 

I am interested in areas such as Machine Learning, Data Science, Manufacturing, Supply Chain Management, Baseball Analytics, History, Geopolitics and Synthetic Biology. I am also a photographer who loves to record beauty of daily life.
