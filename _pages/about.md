I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Browne Center at the University of Pennsylvania and a Yale PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science (degree to be conferred in December 2023). In 2024, I will be an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research agenda, broadly characterized as the international political economy of development, examines the domestic political consequences of foreign aid with particular attention to climate finance and ethnic politics. My book project, which builds off my job market paper, "Greening Foreign Aid: How International Efforts to Promote Clean Energy Backfire," addresses the question, under what conditions do international economic interventions for climate work?
