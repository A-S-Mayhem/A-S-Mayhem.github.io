I'm a Ph.D. student studying artificial intelligence/machine learning under Prof. [Maciej Mazurowski](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowski/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) in the [Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.duke.edu/). My research is in deep learning for medical image analysis, in topics such as anomaly detection and zero-shot learning, self-supervised learning and domain adaptation. 

I have also worked in AI robustness and interpretability as a research intern in the Math, Stats, and Data Science Group at the [Pacific Northwest National Lab](https://www.pnnl.gov/).
