Welcome on my website ! 
======
Welcome on my website ! My name is Nicolas Ghio and I am currently a research data analyst for Pr. [Jesse Rothstein](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~jrothst/) (UC Berkeley). As a part of the [Institute for Research on Labor  and Employment](http://irle.berkeley.edu/) (IRLE), I work mainly on education and labor economics. I graduated from Sciences Po Paris with a BA in Social Sciences and with a [Msc in Economics](http://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-doctorale/en/content/master-s-economics.html). My previous positions include an research internship at the Bank of France and multiple teaching assistant positions over my master for [Pr. Emeric Henry](http://sites.google.com/site/emericmlhenry/home), for [Pr. Pierre Cahuc](http://sites.google.com/site/pierrecahuc/) and for [Pr. Mirko Wiederholt](http://sites.google.com/site/wiederholtmirko/).   More details can be found in my resume here.
