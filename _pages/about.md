Who am I?
======
Hello, I'm Ali Keramati, currently an undergraduate student specializing in Computer Engineering at University of Tehran. My journey into the world of programming commenced during my high school years and continued to flourish as I pursued my higher education in Computer Engineering. Along the way, I made an intriguing choice to complement my major with a Minor in Educational Science, which has broadened my horizons.

Presently, I proudly serve as an undergraduate research assistant at the prestigious Cognitive System Lab at the University of Tehran. My primary focus revolves around the dynamic intersection of Educational Technology and the utilization of Artificial Intelligence in the realm of education. It's an exciting journey, one that constantly fuels my curiosity and passion for innovative solutions in the field.
