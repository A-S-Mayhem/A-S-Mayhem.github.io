This site is a working project with many moving parts. If you have any questions, drop a line. 

Capture the Flag
======
I will be using this site to post CTF adventure articles. This will include CTF writeups, event information, tips and tricks, and useful repositories and tools I've found along the way. Sometime in the near future I will be creating my own CTF tools repository for OSINT and enumeration, stay tuned for details

Security Research
======

As a former OSINT researcher, I will be posting publications here about my personal research. These will mainly include cyber threat analysis and cryptocurrency blockchain analysis.

Site-wide configuration
======

If you have any questions or wish to get in touch, drop a line or reach out via twitter.
