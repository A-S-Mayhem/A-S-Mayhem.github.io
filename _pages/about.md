My name is Kia Rahmani and I am a PhD student of computer science at Purdue University. 
I am a member of the [programming languages group](https://purpl.cs.purdue.edu/), 
working under the supervision of 
Professor [Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/) 
and 
Professor [Benjamin Delaware](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bendy/)
.
The main topics of my research interests include formal methods of modeling, analysis and verification of applications. 
I specifically focus on compilation, synthesis and testing of modern database-backed programs.

I am currently interning at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), working under the supervision of Dr. [Mohammad Raza](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/moraza/).
