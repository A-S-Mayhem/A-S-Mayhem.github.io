I am a <del>first</del> second year Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am advised by <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/orso/">Alex Orso</a> and <a href="http://vhellendoorn.github.io/">Vincent Hellendoorn</a>.


My research area is <a href="https://medium.com/@Kamel773/deep-learning-for-source-code-c1d652ab49fe">Deep Learning for Source Code</a>. More specifically, my research focuses on developing algorithms that <em>extract less but higher quality data</em> from extremely large datasets to train deep learning algorithms on source code for code understanding tasks. The goal is to improve the performance of pre-trained models on small real-world data.
