Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Zixiao Yang (or "杨紫潇" in Chinese; [hear my name](https://www.name-coach.com/zixiao-yang-666)). Currently, I am a Ph.D. student and research assistant in the School of Communication at the University of Miami. My research interests include crisis communication and mental health, mediated health communication, and intercultural communication. I consider myself to be a researcher who is highly analytical, self-motivated, and driven, with a broad range of skills in both quantitative and qualitative research, including, but not limited to, (quasi-) experimental designs, surveys, content analysis, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and textual analysis (NVivo). I am trained using SPSS or R to conduct univariate statistical analysis, multivariate statistical analysis, regression anlysis, meta-analysis, factor analysis, etc. I am also an instructor of record in the Department of Strategic Communication and the Department of Communication Studies. I teach STC 103: Statistical Reasoning for Strategic Communication (Evaluation in Fall 2022: 4.5/5.0) and will teach COS 325: Communication in Health Organizations this fall. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Michelle I. Seelig](https://com.miami.edu/profile/michelle-seelig/) from Department of Interactive Media, University of Miami. I was advised by [Dr. Nicholas Carcioppolo](https://com.miami.edu/profile/nicholas-carcioppolo/) from Department of Communication Studies, University of Miami.
