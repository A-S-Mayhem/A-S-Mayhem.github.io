<h1>About</h1>
------

I have been a member of the [Smart Networking Lab (SNL)](https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/member) for about four years, starting from my undergraduate studies and now continuing into my M.S. in Computer Engineering at Chosun University. My specialization lies in next-generation wireless networks, focusing on optimizing wireless communication systems through various deep reinforcement learning algorithms. This research focuses on resolving trade-off issues and achieving adaptive decision-making processes.

Currently, my greatest interest in R&D extends beyond my major in wireless communications to solving real-world decision-making problems using multi-objective reinforcement learning, and to developing smart solutions that integrate WiFi signals and camera video streams with multi-modal AI models.

As a Research Assistant, I have developed expertise in deep reinforcement learning-based optimization, software-defined radio (SDR) wireless communication systems, massive MIMO systems, IoT & ICT-based smart solutions, and adaptive decision-making methodologies. In my recent lab project, I am leading the development of technology for object detection, motion estimation, and tracking using WiFi-camera data funsion, responsible for hardware configuration, and developing a multi-modal AI model. Outside the university, I also served as a software development tutor at Seji Middle School, teaching basic programming to middle school students for two months. Lastly, my personal interests include music, movies, and running a YouTube channel that demonstrates [research results](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZI9JfPn_Nk6HVkl2aAj4xA).
