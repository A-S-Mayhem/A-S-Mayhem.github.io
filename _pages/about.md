Hi there, I am Yimei Zhang, an undergraduate student in the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing University. I have taken courses in Social Research Methods, Basics of Applied Statistics, Academic Writing and Research Methods in Social Sciences, and Advertising Planning and Creation, etc. My major field of study is Applied Communication (Advertising).

## Education
  * Applied Communication, School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University, 2020-2024
  * ? ? ?, School of Journalism and Communication, ? ? ? University, 2024-2028 (to be updated)
## Interests
  * <font title="blue">Programming</font>: The programming language I’ve been exposed to so far is R. I can use R to analyse survey data in conjunction with basic statistical knowledge, but I haven’t learnt about 'big data' analysis, which is an area I would like to improve in the future.
  * <font title="blue">Health communication</font>: I’m interested in researches in the field of health communication which are integrated with social psychology. These studies usually start with microscopic problems and examine certain patterns of human behaviour.
  * <font title="blue">Computational Communication</font>: I believe that big data can reveal certain patterns. I once read a paper in the direction of computational communication, it was called 'The Interface Between Life and Death: Digital Communication with the Deceased'. This paper has sparked my interest in this direction.
  Health communication or computational communication are two directions I might consider at postgraduate level, but I am still undecided on which one to choose.
  I’d like to receive systematic training and join a research team at undergraduate level, so FEEL FREE to contact me!
