I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Manitoba, where I direct the Robot Autonomy Lab. My research focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous systems and mobile robotics. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques with traditional model-based robotic methodologies, I aim to develop advanced algorithms that ensure the operational safety of autonomous systems in uncertain and dynamic environments.

## I am actively recruiting master's and PhD students! ##
### If you are interested in joining my lab, please apply by sending your CV (2 pages max) titled "RAL2025-Application" to my email address at [jwangjie@outlook.com](mailto:jwangjie@outlook.com). ###

I received my PhD in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, specializing in robotics control, from the University of Calgary. My doctoral research focused on the locomotion mode selection and motion planning of a leg-tracked quadrupedal robot. Prior to my current position, I was a Research Associate at Concordia University, working on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wildfire detection and fighting. I also worked as a Research Associate at the University of Waterloo, developing a safe learning-based control framework for mixed-vehicle platooning control. Additionally, I served as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Queen’s University, proposing a high-performance path-following algorithm for ground mobile robots, and at the University of Calgary, developing robust multi-vehicle tracking algorithms for UAVs.

Throughout my career, I aim to push the boundaries of robotics and autonomous systems, leveraging the strengths of both machine learning and model-based control to address real-world challenges.
