I am Yu Sun, a junior undergraduate at Lanzhou University, currently delving into research on large language models and multimodal interaction technologies. My research endeavors span across a spectrum of artificial intelligence fields including Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Recommendation Systems (RS), Speech Recognition (SR), and Knowledge Graphs (KG). In addition, I have founded a company with the vision of simplifying people's lives through AI technology and highlighting the significance of AI in our daily lives.
