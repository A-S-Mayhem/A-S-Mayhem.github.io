A Brief Self-Introduction
======
My name is Ma Qi (马 骐). In Chinese naming customs, the family name is traditionally placed first, so "Ma" (马) is my family name. The character "Ma" (马) means "horse" in Chinese, while the character "Qi" (骐) refers to a famous excellent horse in history.

I was born in Huaibei, China on July 16, 2002. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree at Université Toulouse III-Paul Sabatier. My research interests span a range of topics, from Partial Differential Equations (PDE) to Geometric Analysis. I am actively searching for opportunities to continue my academic journey by pursuing a Master 2 and a PhD position, both within France and internationally.
