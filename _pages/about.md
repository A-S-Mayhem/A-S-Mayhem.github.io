Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at the **[Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://economics.mit.edu/) (MIT)**. My research is in development economics, focusing on **technology and firms** in lower-income countries, particularly in Francophone West Africa.

My dissertation investigates the adoption and impact of technologies on small and medium-sized businesses, with a particular focus on digital technologies. I examine how relationships within and between firms influence technology adoption and business outcomes. 

Over the past eight years, I have conducted research projects in Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Senegal, and Togo.
