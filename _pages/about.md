Jiwon ("g-1") Kim is a PhD candidate at Emory University's Political Science Department. She also codes for the [Political Terror Scale (PTS)] (https://www.politicalterrorscale.org/ "PTS") and leads the Interstate Shaming Events (ISE) data project, which is a part of her dissertation chapter.

Jiwon studies discourses about political events at different levels of international politics. She is particularly interested in how foreign governments talk about each other's domestic human rights practices, how organizations of different ideological stances report the same conflict event, and what information persuades people to change their opinion about foreign policy, and why. Her works use natural language processing (NLP) and survey experiments.

Jiwon's research uses computer science tools and psychological theories to answer political science questions. She has particular interests in applying various text classification, event extraction, and anaphora resolution schemes with social science sensibilities. 

Jiwon enjoys and believes in collaborative research, and has an interest in creating a healthy and sustainable culture in research labs. Her passion for political science started when she was an exchange student in Hong Kong, during the Umbrella Movement in 2014. Jiwon received her B.A. in literature and linguistics from Sungkyunkwan University in the beautiful and traditional neighborhood of Jongno in Seoul, South Korea.
