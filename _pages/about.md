I am in the last year of my PhD in Economics at UCSB, where I have developed research in Experimental and Behavioral Economics. 
My research is centered on how individuals process information, form beliefs, and make decisions under uncertainty, with a focus on misinformation and risk preferences. 
I combine experimental methods and theoretical modeling to explore these areas, particularly looking at higher-order beliefs, feedback mechanisms, and how people value information.

Recently, I coauthored the paper "Learning Your Own Risk Preferences," published in the Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, where I investigate how individuals reassess their own risk preferences over time and through feedback. I’m also working on projects exploring feedback's role in improving decision-making accuracy, especially in combating misinformation.

I am currently in the Job Market as I near the completion of my Ph.D. in 2025. I’m excited to continue my work in economic research, focusing on information economics and decision theory.
