Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. student at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) in the [Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.duke.edu/) studying machine learning, usually focused on medical imaging. I work as a research assistant with Prof. Maciej Mazurowski in [his lab](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowski/), associated with the [Duke Center for Artificial Intelligence in Radiology](https://radiology.duke.edu/research/centers-and-shared-resources/duke-center-for-artificial-intelligence-in-radiology/) and [Duke AI Health](https://aihealth.duke.edu/).

My current research focuses on anomaly detection and zero-shot learning, domain adaptation, and other topics relevant to medical imaging; see [here](https://nickk124.github.io/publications/) or my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a9rXidMAAAAJ&hl=en) for a list of my publications.

I graduated from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) in 2020 with degrees in Physics and Mathematics, where my research with [Prof. Daniel Reichart](https://www.danreichart.com/) focused on the development of statistical techniques for astronomical data applications.

Teaching is also important to me, and I have been an educator [in the academic setting and beyond](https://nickk124.github.io/teaching/). I have also worked on many [side projects](https://nickk124.github.io/projects/) that have captured my interest. See [here](https://nickk124.github.io/cv/) for my updated CV.

On my free time, I enjoy playing the french horn, practicing jiu-jitsu, running, cooking and reading.
