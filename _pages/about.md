My name is Sunmook Choi (최선묵).

I am a M.S. student in Mathematics at Korea University under supervision of Professor [Seungsang Oh](https://sites.google.com/view/seungsangoh/home).
I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Korea University. My research interest broadly lies on theoretical aspects of data science, machine learning, deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning and their applications.

This is my [CV (updated Nov. 2023)](http://smfelixchoi.github.io/files/CV.pdf). Thank you.
