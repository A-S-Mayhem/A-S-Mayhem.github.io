Welcome! 

I am a first-year PhD student at the Deparment of Political Science, Washington University in St. Louis. I am interested in information politics, political methodologies including text analysis and causal inference, as well as authoritarian politics with a regional focus on China. I enrolled in a dual-degree program initiated and funded by the Bai Xian Asia Insitute. I received my Bachelor of Science in Global China Studies from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Bachelor of Art in Economics from Waseda University in 2020. 

Feel free to reach me at weiye.deng@wustl.edu.
