I am a PhD student at the Architecture and Industrial Design Department of the University of Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli". My research focus is on human-centered approach of multisensory design of urban parks.

On this website I present some of my scientific research and write about things that I find interesting, mostly related to architecture design, neuroscience theory and virtual reality technology.
