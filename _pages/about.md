I am a Ph.D. candidate under the guidance of [Professor Kristina Yordanova](http://stenialo.org/about-me/) at the Institute of Data Science, University of Greifswald, where I am exploring the fascinating fields of Data Science and Natural Language Processing.
Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a Research Assistant at the [University of Rostock](https://www.mmis.informatik.uni-rostock.de/), where I delved into Neural Density Estimation for the project [NEISS](https://www.neiss.uni-rostock.de/). I also had the opportunity to hone my skills as a Software Engineer at [PLANET AI](https://planet-ai.de/), where I contributed to the development and testing of [Intelligent Document Analysis](https://planet-ai.de/products/ida/) software.

 <h2>Past Research</h2>
 
 - My [Master thesis](https://dipendrayadaveee.github.io/files/Master_Thesis_Yadav_Dipendra.pdf) research investigated the use of Transfer Learning on Deep NLP systems for languages with limited annotation.

 - During my [Specialization](https://dipendrayadaveee.github.io/files/Yadav_Dipendra_Specialization_Electrical_Engineering.pdf) research, I worked on Automatic Object detection for Video-based intention recognition on CMU Quality of life grand challenge kitchen dataset.

<h2>More</h2>

- Hailing from [Rajbiraj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajbiraj), Nepal, I find immense pleasure in delving into the pages of books, indulging in movies, socializing with like-minded individuals, and embarking on refreshing bicycle rides.

- As a coordinator and event manager for International Founders at [Grundungswerft](https://gruendungswerft.com/en/locations/rostock/), I have the privilege of helping ambitious individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds kickstart their entrepreneurial dreams in Mecklenburg Vorpommern, Germany.
