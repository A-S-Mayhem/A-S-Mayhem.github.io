Hi! My name is D K Bhargav Achary, most people simply call me "Bhargav"!

After being habituated to ask WHY and HOW 'n' number of times from my early education in Odisha, I have always fascinated for research! And, for finding answers to some of my WHYs on my own, I joined IIT Hyderabad as a Ph.D. student in 2018.

I am in the 3rd year of my Ph.D. in the dept of CSE at IITH, researching in the area of micro-architectural hardware security of Deep Learning. I am a member of <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/biswap/CARS.html" target="_blank">CARS Lab</a> at IITK. I am being jointly supervised by <a href="http://faculty.iitr.ac.in/~sparshfec/" target="_blank">Dr. Sparsh Mittal @ IITR</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/biswap/" target="_blank">Biswa @ IITK</a>.

Prior to joining IITH for my Ph.D., I have worked in Infosys Limited and DRDO (Defence Research and Dvelopment Orgnisation), India.

I have earned a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and Diploma in Computer Science and Engineering. My interests in consumer electronics and computing devices keeps me hooked up in exploring new technologies and science.

Through this website, I would disucss about my research, but also attempt to be a science communicator.
Stay Tuned! The website is about to get updated with time.

Thanks for visiting!
