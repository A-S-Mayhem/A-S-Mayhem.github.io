I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Guoliang Fan](https://ceat.okstate.edu/ece/faculty/guoliang-fan.html) in the [School of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ceat.okstate.edu/ece/) of the Oklahoma State University (OSU). Before studying at OSU, I worked as a software testing engineer in China for seven years.

Research Interests
======
I specialize in the investigation of first-person vision, with a particular focus on indoor localization leveraging wearable devices. My work emphasizes developing and refining geometric algorithms for camera pose estimation, seamlessly incorporating advanced deep-learning techniques. As an educator, I guide undergraduates in Electric Circuits and Signal Analysis while fostering the growth of graduate students in image processing research.

* Computer Vision: camera pose estimation, object recognition, scene understanding
* Wearable Computing: wearable cameras, smart glasses
* First Person Vision: perspective, healthcare 
* Machine Learning: deep learning, transfer learning
