* I am a Research Intern @ the Autonomous Agents Research Group at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh where  I am supervised by [Dr Stefano Albrecht](http://svalbrecht.de/) and working on stabilizing Generative Adversarial Networks training.
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine intelligence, reinforcement learning and deep learning. I am particularly interested in multi-agent learning (specifically, multi-agent reinforcement learning), generative adversarial networks, evolutionary dynamics, the theory of mind and combining all of the above to establish intelligent systems which can reason and act in complex environments.
* I received my Bachelor's degree from [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) where I have graduated with a first class honours BASc degree with distinction (Dean's List), majoring in computer science and minoring in economics. My dissertation focused on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in sequential social dilemmas and was advised by Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/Jun.Wang/) and Dr [Manuela Dal Borgo](http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/cto/md762).
* Previously I enjoyed working on ML models (mainly NLP) at amazing start-ups such as Growbots (advised by OpenAI's co-founder) and Plural AI (backed  by Entrepreneur First).
