Iâ€™m a senior Computer Science major, pursuing a profession in research and currently applying to PhD programs in Computer Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and cybersecurity, the security of ML and applications of ML to cybersecurity problems. I am also interested in genetic algorithms, privacy, and tech policy.

Since May 2021, I have worked for Pomona College's ARCS (Autonomous Robotics and Complex Systems) Lab, where I relate my research interests to problems in robotics, primarily focusing on creative methods to ease the pain of sim-to-real transfer. Beyond the lab, I have interned at AT&T, developing sentiment analysis models for fraud detection and researching explainable ML for key sentiment identification. And, I have also interned at Meta, where I created a social media app for surfers.

These days, I am working on my senior thesis, researching the security vulnerabilities of federated learning systems and exploring potential approaches to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

In my free time, I like to play guitar and surf. But not at the same time...
