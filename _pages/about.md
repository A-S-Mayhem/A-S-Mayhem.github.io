I am a Ph.D. student in [Political Science at Georgia State University](https://politicalscience.gsu.edu/) in Atlanta, Georgia. My research agenda focuses on political parties and competitive authoritarian regimes. I am currently co-chair of Atlanta Symposium on Political Science (ASOPS). I recieved my BA and MA from [Political Science and International Relations Department at Bogazici University](https://pols.boun.edu.tr/). My MA thesis focuses on the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the role of civil society in educational policymaking in Turkey. 

In my free time I like to hike, play tennis, cook, read and play tabletop games.

I can be contacted at otuncelgurlek1 [at] gsu [dot] edu.
