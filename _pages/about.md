I'm a graduated student from [Department of Physical Education]([https://yonsei.elsevierpure.com/en/organisations/department-of-physical-education]), [Yonsei University]([https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp]). My research interest includes Sedentary behavior, Cardiometabolic health, Wearable technology, Physical Activity, Chronic Inflammation, and Skeletal Muscle.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sang-Hoon Suh & Baek Il-young]([https://yonsei.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/sang-hoon-suh]) of Exercise and Energy Metabolism Lab from [School of Physical Education]([https://cs.pku.edu.cn/](http://ped.yonsei.ac.kr/]), Yonsei University. I was advised by [Prof. Kai Li] from [School of  Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/](https://e.jxust.edu.cn/info/1198/1026.htm), JiangXi University of Science and Technology.
