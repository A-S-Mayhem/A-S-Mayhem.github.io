# About Me

I'm a junior-year undergraduate student at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) majoring in Robotic Engineering and Mathematics. Currently, I am conducting research on multiple robotic and computer vision topics: 3D Point Cloud Completion, FDM Printing Soft Robotics, Robotic Task Motion Planning, and Medical Assistive Automation. My research works are supervised by Prof. [Ziming Zhang](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/zzhang15) at [VISLab@WPI](https://zhang-vislab.github.io/), Prof. [Markus Nemitz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/mnemitz) at [RMG](https://wp.wpi.edu/roboticmaterialsgroup/), and Prof. [Christopher Julius Nycz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/cjnycz) at [AIM Lab](http://aimlab.wpi.edu/).
