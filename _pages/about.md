Hello!

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Dr. Stephen Montgomery's lab](https://smontgomlab.github.io/index.html) at Stanford University. I defended my PhD in the [Tri-Institutional Computational Biology & Medicine program](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/), where I researched the genetic basis of human disease using computational and statistical approaches within the labs of [Olivier Elemento](https://elementolab.weill.cornell.edu/) and [Andy Clark](https://blogs.cornell.edu/andyclarklab/) at Cornell's [NYC](https://eipm.weill.cornell.edu/) and [Ithaca](https://cb.cornell.edu/) campuses.

Previously, I received my B.S. from Cornell University in [Biometry & Statistics](https://cals.cornell.edu/education/degrees-programs/biometry-statistics-major-and-minor), with a minor in Biological Sciences and a concentration in Statistical Genomics. During undergraduate, I worked in [Philipp Messer's group](https://messerlab.org/) on a Bayesian coalescent framework for inferring selective sweeps in population genetic data and with [Pat Sullivan](https://dnr.cals.cornell.edu/people/patrick-sullivan/) on modeling fish population dynamics in time-series data. For two summers, I was a statistical genetics intern at the [Regeneron Genetics Center](https://www.regeneron.com/genetics-center) in Tarrytown, NY, where I evaluated statistical methodologies for genome-wide association studies.

My long-term interests are to use genetic and multi-omic information for (1) therapeutic target discovery, by discovering new genetic associations and their underlying mechanisms; (2) precision medicine, by personalizing treatment regimens based on molecular alterations, and (3) interventive and preventive care, by identifying high-risk individuals for screening & other preventive strategies. I believe we need better conceptual approaches for understanding the genotype-to-phenotype map; as a result, my current research spans both basic and more translational research areas.
