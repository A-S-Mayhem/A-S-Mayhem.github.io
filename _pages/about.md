I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Citrine Informatics](http://www.citrine.io), where we are building the world's largest data platform backed by AI for materials discovery and optimization. My primary interests include machine learning, data viz, and the intersection of data-driven techniques with physical sciences.

I have a PhD in Physics from UC Santa Cruz, where my research involved semiconductor nanomaterials for next-generation energy harvesting.
