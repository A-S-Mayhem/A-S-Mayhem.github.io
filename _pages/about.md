Hello, my name is Changjing Liu (刘常靖), a master student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China, welcome to my homepage!
Right now I major in Instrument Acience and Technology.
My current research interest mainly focus on **medicial simulation and medicial robotics** supervised by [Prof. Zhiwu Wang](http://www.ie.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/260) and [Prof. GuoZheng Yan](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%A2%9C%E5%9B%BD%E6%AD%A3/437103).

Prior to this, I graduated from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China in 2021 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering (Mechatronics), and seized the award of the First Prize Scholarship at Tongji University (Top 5%). 
During my undergraduate studies, I mainly focused on **drone visuial tracking** under the supervision of [Prof. Changhong Fu](https://vision4robotics.github.io/authors/changhong-fu/) in [Vision4Rbotics Group](https://vision4robotics.github.io/).

I'm looking for a job or Ph.D opportunity in the field of **medicial simulation, robotics**, etc.
