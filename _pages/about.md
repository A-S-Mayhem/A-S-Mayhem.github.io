Welcome. I'm Mark, a Data Science, Engineering and Technology consultant with years of experience in solving data challenges.
The insight and deeper meaning within data is what primarily drives my curiosity.
I love combining my data intuition and analytical skills to continue helping businesses and clients make sense of their data.

Data Science & Data Engineering
======
I first discovered Data Science as the field evolved from a combination of Statistics and Quantitative Methods using programmatic solutions.
The discipline in designing research experiment procedures that address worthy questions in business and in policy
is a constant source of my intellectual pursuit.

The immense challenge of storing and processing it to be analysis-ready has been a more recent and interesting technical endeavor.
The vast size and scale of data requires processes to be as automated as possible,
so that we as humans can apply our critical thinking decision skills that matter most.

**Cloud Services** are fundamental tools that I've adopted. Such projects include NoSQL Data Warehouses in Redshift, Data Lakes in Spark/PySpark on Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) clusters and Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets. For data pipelines and DAGs, Apache Airflow. Lab projects include core Amazon web services such as Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2), Elastic Block Storage (EBS), and Relational Database Service (RDS).

Research & Projects
======

**Machine Learning** has been a powerful technique in my research interests.
Recently I co-authored a research publication for an annual 2021 ACM Symposium On Applied Computing.
This classifier uses Neural Networks to help medical research predict the risk of asthma for individual patients.
I'm always looking for my next opportunity to contribute.
This and other ML projects include techniques such as
* Transfer Learning for Feed-Forward Neural Network Classifier.
* Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction
* Unsupervised Learning and Clustering of marketing analytics datasets

Remote Sensing & GIS
------
Projects in geospatial analysis include impact evaluation in vegetative restoration maps (NDVI), and georeferencing Earth at Night imagery for data modeling.
I'm also involved in a collaborative project using Computer Vision to classify farming land habitation.
