Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography, co-advised by [Caroline Ummenhofer](https://ummenhofer.whoi.edu/) and [Delia Oppo](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/doppo/). I am interested in tropical climate dynamics and variability on decadal to centennial timescales. 

My doctoral thesis is aimed at understanding climate variability in the Indo-Pacific, focusing on the atmospheric and oceanic pathways along with regional hydroclimate impacts. I utilize climate models, observations, as well as paleoclimate archives to tackle these questions. Outside of research, I enjoy playing tennis, skiing in the winter, and rock climbing.
