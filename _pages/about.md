I am a change change impact researcher based at Princeton University. I am currently a <a href='https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/lisa-thalheimer/' target="_blank">Postdoctoral Research Associate</a> at the <a href='https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/index.html' target="_blank">Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment (C-PREE)</a>. My research focuses on the attribution of extreme weather events and human-induced climate change, and human responses such as migration and displacement. My research interest focuses around three pillars
1) effect
2) multi-causality
3) interventions.
