Welcome to my website.

I am a Quant at QLS Advisors in Cambridge, MA. 

Previously, I was a software engineer at Siemens Digital industries software working on computational geometry for the Parasolid geometric kernel used in many CAD/CAE/CAM packages.

I obtained a BSc in Mathematics at Imperial College London and a MSc in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Oxford. At the time, I was interesting in geometry (mostly differential geometry), computational algebra and graph theory/network science. I then graduated from Harvard University with an ME in Computational Science and Engineering where I was fortunate to be taught by amazing professors such as Chris Rycroft and Weiwei Pan and to be advised by Pavlos Protopapas and Marios Mattheakis for my thesis.

I like Machine Learning and Network Science. 

My Erd≈ës number is 4.
