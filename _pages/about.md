My name is José and I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Instituto Superior Técnico with a passion for the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Medicine. My research interests lie in the development of explainable AI (XAI) models. My goal is to create AI systems that seamlessly integrate with radiologists' workflows to enhance diagnostic accuracy and ultimately contribute to the creation of sustainable, efficient healthcare systems that benefit both experts and patients. Join me on this exciting journey at the crossroads of technology and healthcare!
