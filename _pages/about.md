Welcome! I am a 2nd-year master student of Artificial Intelligence at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en). I'm advised by Prof. [Ruihua Song](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/addons/teacher/index/info.html?user_id=0&ruccode=ATNUbVJhBjJRNgY3UDQFMg%3D%3D&ln=en), working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Multimodal Dialogue. Prior to that, I completed my B.S. from School of Computer Science and Technology, [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/).

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Multimodal Learning. 

Recently, I have been dedicated to enabling Large Language Models (LLM) to process multimodal information and endowing them with the ability to perceive the world, in order to advance the development of Multimodal Dialogue.
