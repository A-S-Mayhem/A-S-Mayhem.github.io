Hi there! I'm Samantha Scibelli, a graduate and NSF Fellow in the Departement of Astronomy at [Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona ](https://www.as.arizona.edu/) 

Interests
======
My research interests focus on star formation and on the cold clumps of gas and dust stars form in, known as starless/prestellar cores, along filamentary star forming regions. Specifically I want to understand on how chemistry can help us understand the physcial properties and evolutionary timescales of the prestellar cores.
