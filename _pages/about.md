Hello and welcome to my research website! <br />
I am Dipendra Yadav, currently employed as a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Data Science at the University of Greifswald. I am under the supervision of [Professor Kristina Yordanova](http://stenialo.org/about-me/) and I am thrilled to be conducting cutting-edge research in the fields of Data Science and Natural Language Processing. I have a background in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, with a major in Natural Language Processing. <br /> Before joining the University of Greifswald, I served as a Research Assistant at the University of Rostock, where I explored Neural Density Estimation.  Additionally, I worked as a Software Engineer at PLANET AI, where I gained hands-on experience in developing and testing [Intelligent Document Analysis software](https://planet-ai.de/applications/document-analysis/solutions/). <br /> On this website, you will find information about my research, education, and work experience.
