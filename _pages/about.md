I am currently a 1st year Ph.D. student at the CSE Department, the HKUST, advised by [Professor Qiang Yang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~qyang/). My research interests lie in machine learning and data mining, and I am currently devoted into the newly proposed **Federated Learning**, both in algorithms and in privacy & security. I also find interest in *network analysis and mining*, such as *graph embedding and graph neural networks*. 

Prior to joining the HKUST, I spent 4 wonderful years at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), China, obtaining both a B.S in Computer Science and a B.Economics at the National School of Development. I was fortunate to have [Prof. Guojie Song](https://gjsong-pku.cn) as my advisor during my days at PKU, with whom I collaborate very well.

Miscellaneous
======
I hold a broad range of interests so as to keep enjoying life. 

I enjoy sports including jogging and basketball. My favourite team in NBA is San Antonio Spurs and my favourite football club is Liverpool FC. 

I am a civil aviation enthusiast. I am a member of the ACICFG, a team devoted to making subtitles and captions for documentaries related to civil aviation (such as the **Air Crash Investigation**). Some of our works are published on [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/358422). I also write some articles on [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/mai-kang-ming/activities) related to civil aviation and my research. 

I am an alcoholist and I enjoy drinking, ranging from beers (American IPA, Trappist and Hefeweizen), Vodka (Smirnoff Black, Grey Goose) and Single Malt Scotch (among which I prefer Talisker, Lagavulin and Cragganmore). An image demonstrating genres of single malt scotch is [here](http://kl4805.github.io/files/Whiskey.jpeg).

Friends
