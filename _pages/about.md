I am an assistant professor working on data ethics and data governance at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) in Munich, Germany. My current research focuses on raising individual awareness of the risks and benefits of different data-sharing contexts. This includes theoretical work on data privacy and empirical work on the impact of social information on individual decision-making.

Previously, I completed my PhD in philosophy on the social role of AI advisors, where I asked whether advisory artificial intelligence (AI) systems are classified as mere tools or human-like agents. I provided conceptual and empirical reasons that they are something in between. Throughout my PhD I was a fully funded fellow of the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt).

Previous work has focused on human-AI responsibility sharing, the social influence on perception, and intelligent sensory augmentation. 

Besides philosophy, I am the co-founder of a public-facing 'AI-workshop' series that brings technical, ethical, and practical knowledge around AI systems to the general public. Before, I was the Academic Director of [ThinkTech](https://www.thinktech.ngo/), a non-profit organization discussing the societal impact of technology. 

I am part of the Cognition, Values and Behaviour group ([CVBE](https://www.cvbe.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/about_us/index.html)) lab and the Munich Intelligence Initiative ([Mi3](https://mi3.info/)).
