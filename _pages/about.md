#### Climate-Tectonic interection

* I am fascinated by geoscience and interested in the interactions between climate and tectonic processes that impact the habitability and sustainability of life. My research focuses on quantifying climate-tectonic interplay in shaping earth's surface and paleoenvironment using (1) geochronology, such as low-temperature thermochronology and optically stimulated luminescence dating; (2) remote sensing data; (3) multidisciplinary sedimentology, tectonics, and geomorphology approach; and (4) statistical and numerical modeling. I have worked on Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya (specifically in the Siang, Dibang, and Lohit river valleys), the Shillong plateau, and the Belt of Schuppen (especially in the southeastern boundary of Assam valley and the western part of Nagaland).

#### Mineral-Microbe interection

* My post-doctoral research hooked into mineral-microbe interections and geobiotechnology. Now exploring (1) surface reactions of microbe and biomolecule with minerals; (2) effect of mineral biotic and abiotic interactive processes on the structure and activities of microbial communities; and (3) biogeochemical transformation and transport of chemical and biological components at different temporal and spatial scales.
  
#### Science Education Research

* My science education research involves designing research projects and conducting field-works for school students as a means to popularise geoscience and prepare them for careers in Earth Sciences.
