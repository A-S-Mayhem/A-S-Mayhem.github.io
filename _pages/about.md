I research the complex processes that connect rocks, water, and life. I enjoy working in interdisciplinary science research and education aspects. My deep interest lies in integrating geoscience, mineralogy, biogeochemistry, and geomicrobiology for studying the impact of climate change and environmental pollution on securing water and food for sustainable future. As a geoscientist, the scientific tools that fascinate me most include geo-thermochronometric dating, luminescence dating, geomorphometric analysis, and reactive transport modeling in porous medium. These tools can provide data about erosion and weathering patterns, regolith formation, and biogeochemical cycling from sediment, rock, and soil samples. Integrating these data can help in understanding how natural processes and humans shape Earth's surface in making our Earth habitable, and this, in turn, can enable better management of Earth's resources effectively and efficiently.
