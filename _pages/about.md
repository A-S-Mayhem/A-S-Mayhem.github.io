I am originally from P.R.China. I completed my bachelor's degree from NUFE. After that, I worked in a software company and a store.

I returned to academia because I experienced several challenges as a development practitioner back home and I wanted more insights on those issues. Broadly, I am interested in many areas. More specifically, I am interested.

I enjoy chinese calligraphy, learning about different cultures and traveling.
