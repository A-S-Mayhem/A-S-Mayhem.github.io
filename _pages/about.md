Hi, welcome to my personal website! I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Imaging and Innovation and Research [(CAI2R)](https://cai2r.net/), Department of Radiology, [New York University Grossman School of Medicine](https://med.nyu.edu/), New York, NY, USA. I received my PhD degree from the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology [(Skoltech)](https://skoltech.ru/), Center for Computational and Data-Intensive Science and Engineering [(CDISE)](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/phd-programs/computational-and-data-science-and-engineering/), Moscow, Russian Federation, in 2020. I was a one-year (2019) visiting PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology [(MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/), at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science [(EECS)](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), Research Laboratory of Electronics [(RLE)](https://www.rle.mit.edu/), Cambridge, MA, USA. I received my Diploma degree from the [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/), [school of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ee.auth.gr/en/), Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2016. I grew up in Athens, Greece, and attended high school at the [Arsakeia-Tositseia Schools of Psychiko](https://www.arsakeio.gr/en/).

My resreach interests are focused on computational methods and machine learning algorithms for problems in biomedical imaging and bioengineering. I am developing computational electromagnetic simulation tools based on integral equation methods and numerical linear algebra algorithms (matrix & tensor decompositions) for radiofrequency coil design, parallel magnetic resonance imaging and electrical property tomography. Other areas that I am highly interested in are inverse problems in physics and deep learning algorithms.
