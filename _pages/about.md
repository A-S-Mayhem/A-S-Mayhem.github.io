I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto Scarborough. My main interest is in the nature of semantic knowledge that humans use to understand language, specifically polysemy and lexical ambiguity. Currently, I am working on regular polysemy and the multimodal nature of lexical ambiguity using computational models.

Initially, I was trained as a philosopher of language and worked in formal semantics and pragmatics, but more recently I have worked in the field of psycholinguistics and computational linguistics. As a result, I aim to connect these different fields by using behavioral experiments and computational modeling, such as deep neural networks and statistical models, to verify different theories of lexical meaning, compositional meaning, and pragmatics. My long-term goal is to use my interdisciplinary background to scientifically understand the nature of language and cognition, with the help of contemporary philosophical theorizing, and to promote interdisciplinary cooperation between different fields of language study.
