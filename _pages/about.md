As an assistant professor at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, my expertise centers around Financial Accounting and Corporate Governance. 

Before embarking on my academic career, I spent several years as a portfolio manager in the banking sector, which has given me valuable practical knowledge that informs my teaching approach. As an educator, I strive to offer my students a unique blend of theoretical understanding and practical insights drawn from research.

I am also affiliated with the Barcelona School of Economics and the UPF Barcelona School of Management; and  co-organize the Barcelona Accounting Seminars and Workshops.
