My name's Jake, and I'm an economics PhD candidate at Northwestern University with research interests in industrial organization and macroeconomics. Prior to my PhD, I studied (and [ran!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eidacczk0gg)) at the University of Chicago, served as an AmeriCorps VISTA at the [IndyEast Promise Zone](https://indyeast.org), and worked as pre-doc at Northwestern.
