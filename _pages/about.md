About
======
I am currently a PhD student in [the School of Information](https://ischool.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I'm supervised by [Dr. Muhammad Abdul-mageed](https://mageed.arts.ubc.ca/). My broad research interests are in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, Speech Technologies, and Multi-lingual/Multi-dialectal Information Processing. Previously, I earned a MSc and BSc degrees in Computer Science from the [Jordan University of Science and Technology](https://www.just.edu.jo/Pages/Default.aspx). Before starting my PhD journey, I was a Sr. Data Scientist and NLU team leader in the Artificial Intelligence department at [Mawdoo3 Ltd.](http://ai.mawdoo3.com), Amman-Jordan. Before Mawdoo3, I was a Researcher and Machine Learning Engineer at [Samsung Electronics](https://research.samsung.com/srjo), Amman-Jordan.
