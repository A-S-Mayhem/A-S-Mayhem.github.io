I am a geoscientist, interested in measurement tools that can reveal patterns of erosion, weathering, regolith formation and biogeochemical cycling. These tools include geochemical, isotopic and geophysical methods along with numerical and statistical models. Integrating these measurements can help in understanding connection between life and landscape and making progress in understanding how natural processes and humans shape Earth’s surface. 

I was born in Assam in a village called Dhalpur that lies in the northern bank of Brahmaputra and also at the foothills of Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya. Science and the unknown have always fascinated me since my childhood. I am the first person in my family to pursue higher studies. I studied geological sciences at Gauhati University (oldest university in Assam). After receiving  B.Sc. and M.Sc. from Gauhati University and M.Tech. from Dibrugarh University, Assam, I moved to Mumbai in 2014 to pursue my PhD at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB). After receiving my PhD in 2020, I started postdoc until 2022 in IITB. It was the best eight years and a life transforming journey at IITB. Then moved to Uttarakhand to start my first job as Assistant professor at SDSU University, Rhishikesh, and  in mid of August 2023 moved to Bengaluru to join as a researcher in Earth Sciences lab at Prayoga Institute of Education Research (Prayoga), which is my current home.

I deeply care about student education and I feel strongly about keeping high standards when mentoring, advising and teaching students. I use a combined approach that involves teaching contents with experiential learning approach including ‘hands-on learning’ through laboratory experiments and field-work, and ‘reflection-on doing’ in the classrooms.  My approach to mentoring students is always focused at facilitating basic knowledge and constant support in order for students to conduct their own research independently and critically. Main element of my approach is to develop in the student a high level of independence in terms of both scientific approach and decision making. I am committed to developing, growing, and maintaining a vibrant research atmosphere.

When I am not in the office or lab or in the field, I like to play badminton, swim, run, meditate, read philosophy-spirituality and travel with my wife.
