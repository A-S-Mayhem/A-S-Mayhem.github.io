I am a first-year PhD student in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). My research interests lie in network control systems with applications to multi-robot systems. In Spring 2020, I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Maryland (UMD). While at UMD, I worked with Prof. Yancy Diaz-Mercado on multi-robot coverage control and its applications. 

While an undergraduate student at UMD, I worked internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, MIT Lincoln Lab, and The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, where I worked on mechanical design, mechanical testing, and multi-robot reach-avoid games, respectively. I have also served as a tutor for differential equations, teaching fellow for engineering dynamics, and teaching assistant for calculus I and II.
