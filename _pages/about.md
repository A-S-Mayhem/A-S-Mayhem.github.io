My name is Nima Ghorbani, and I'm a Research Engineer at [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/), Tübingen, Germany. 
I work in the [Perceiving Systems Department](https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackAtBrown) directed by [Michael Black](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/black).
My research primarily focuses on human body in motion. 
Specifically, I am interested in learning about how humans move from the data captured of them doing so.
The main source of data that I work with comes in form of monocular videos, images, and marker based optical motion capture systems.


I have attended Tabriz Azad University, Tabriz, Iran for my undergraduate education, where I received a BSc. in Electrical Engineering.
Afterwards, I attended [Neural Information Processing](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/master/neural-inf-process/) 
program at [Graduate Training Centre of Neuroscience](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/) in Tübingen, Germany.
