I'm an Applied Research Scientist at [Kaia Health GmbH, Munich, Germany](https://kaiahealth.com/). Before I was a Research Engineer at the  [Perceiving Systems Department](https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackAtBrown) of the [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/) lead by [Michael Black](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/black).

My research and interests primarily cover machine learning for computer vision and computer graphics with the focus on 3D human and animal body in motion.
The main source of data that I work with comes in form of monocular videos, images,
and time-sequence marker trajectories captured by marker based optical motion capture systems.

I have attended Tabriz Azad University, [Tabriz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWb1yP-KpMc), 
[Iran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuITzmlIvbc) for my undergraduate education, where I received a BSc. in Electrical Engineering.
Afterward, I attended the [Neural Information Processing](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/master/neural-inf-process/) 
program at the [Graduate Training Centre of Neuroscience](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/) in TÃ¼bingen, Germany.
