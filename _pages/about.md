<h1>About</h1>
------

I have been actively involved as a wireless communication researcher at the [Smart Networking Lab (SNL)](https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/member) for about 4 years, starting from my undergraduate studies through to my Master's degree in Computer Science at Chosun University. My expertise lies in the optimization of next-generation wireless networks, focusing on enhancing wireless communication systems and base stations through various deep reinforcement learning algorithms. In particular, I designed the multi-objective asynchronous advantage single actor-multiple critics (MO-A3Cs) algorithm for base station transmission power allocation, proposing a technique that simultaneously optimizes network spectral and energy efficiency.

Currently, my greatest interest in R&D is focused on optimization at the physical layer for 5G/B5G and decision-making optimization at base stations. Additionally, my work extends to developing a non-visual object detection solution that integrates WiFi signals and camera streams through a multimodal AI model.

As a research assistant, I have acquired and developed expertise in optimizing wireless systems using deep reinforcement learning, designing and building wireless testbeds based on Software Defined Radio (SDR), massive MIMO systems, and IoT and ICT technologies. Recently, I have taken the lead in a project applying multimodal AI techniques for object detection, motion estimation, and tracking using WiFi-camera data pairs, being responsible for hardware setup and the development of multimodal AI models. Outside of the university, I have taught C language and algorithms at Seji Middle School in Naju for two months as a software development teacher. Lastly, my interests include music, research, and running a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZI9JfPn_Nk6HVkl2aAj4xA) where I share the methodologies and results of my research.
