I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India.

There, I am currently working at the intersection of **AI + SE**, specifically using LLMs such as GPT* to perform model-based testing. Previously, I had worked with OpenTelemetry and runtime binary instrumentation of .NET Services for zero-touch distributed tracing.

I completed my Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering from BITS Pilani Pilani Campus, where I took a variety of courses relating to Networks, Operating Systems, and Parallel Computing.

During my Bachelor Thesis, I visited the [EASE Lab](https://easelab.inf.ed.ac.uk) University of Edinburgh, advised by [Dr. Boris Grot](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bgrot/). There, I worked on Serverless computing, specifically creating a set of microbenchmarks for testing the performance of Serverless platforms, [vSwarm](https://github.com/vhive-serverless/vSwarm).
