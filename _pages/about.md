I am a Ph.D student at the University of Pennsylvania: Department of Computer and Information Science pursuing research in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am a member of the [Cognitive Computation Group](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/) advised by Prof. [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/). My research broadly focuses on improving the reasoning capabilities of machine learning models in grounded domains. I am also very interested in robust learning and learning from weak supervision.
