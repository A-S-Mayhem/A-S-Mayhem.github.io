My research interests are computer vision and trustworthy machine learning.

During my B.Sc. in computer science at university of Tehran, I tried to build a solid background for my future research. So beside my university courses in math and computer science, I joined TaarLab (Human and Robot Interaction Laboratory) under the supervision of [Dr. Tale Masoule](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gkiFy20AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) where I presented a geometry-based algorithm which can find grasp poses based on the geometry of the unknown object and propose the ones which may lead to successful grasping. The main goal of the algorithm was to produce meaningful grasping key points instead of using random points for the learning algorithms. Having several successful and unsuccessful grasp poses for each object is much more useful than random points for RL learning algorithms. Our paper is accepted in [ICEEconf](https://iceeconf.ir/2023) and it will be indexed in IEEE soon.

Subsequently, I enrolled an internship under the supervision of [Prof. Ngai-Man (Man) Cheung](https://sites.google.com/site/mancheung0407/). My research was about generative model and we were focusing on diffusion models particularly. I implemented a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and tried to train it with limited data. I am interested in generative models and improving them.
