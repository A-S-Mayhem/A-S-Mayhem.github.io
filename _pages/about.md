I am a Ph.D. student in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. I work in the [Variability Lab](https://cmu-variability.github.io/ "Lab site"), advised by [Andrew Begel](https://andrewbegel.com/ "Andrew's Site").

I research psychologically safe collaboration in neurodiverse AI engineering teams. I aim to discover design principles for software development tools that support psychological safety among engineers with social and emotional differences. This will be useful for fostering team learning, well-being, and productivity.

I have worked with Deloitte, Google, and the Caribbean Science Foundation.
