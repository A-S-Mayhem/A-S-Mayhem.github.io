I am a graduate Data Science student at LMU Munich and currently write my master thesis on the topic "Conditional Normalizing Flows for Interpretability" with PhD Candidate [Gunnar König](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/koenig/) and Prof. Dr.-Ing. [Moritz Grosse-Wentrup](https://www.mcn.uni-muenchen.de/members/former/grosse-wentrup/index.html).   

Simultaneously, I work as a research assistant at Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits with PhD Candidate [Evgeniy Faerman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgeniy-faerman-647a8a1b) in the realm of Deep Semi-Supervised learning.

I believe in the data-driven automation and human-computer cooperation – they should become the main booster of sustainable development and inclusive society.

My research interests include **Semi-Supervised learning**, **Representation learning**, **Causality inference**.
