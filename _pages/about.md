Hi, I'm Paschal *(pas-kal)*.  
I'm a PhD student at Purdue University's Elmore Family School of ECE, currently advised by [Prof Jamie Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/).

## Research Interests
My research interest in focused on designing tooling that enable secure software development. Specifically, I study prevalent security vulnerabilities in software components (memory safety vulnerabilities, supply chain vulnerabilities) and develop systematic testing, dynamic or formal methods that enable their detection. My research has been published at the top software engineering venues: [ICSE 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14117), [ASE 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10298483) and [ESEC/FSE 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3540250.3560879).
