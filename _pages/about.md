I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Probability](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chih-Li Sung](https://chihli.github.io).

My current research interests include **computer experiment, uncertainty quantification, and multi-fidelity simulation** in the field of **industrial/engineering statistics**.
