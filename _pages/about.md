I am a final-year undergraduate student from the [Zhi Class](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/rcpy/zbpy/zbjj.htm) at the [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io/) from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). Previously, I was advised by [Prof. Di He](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/) from the [School of Intelligence Science and Technology](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

My current research interests include how large models extract knowledge and the reasons behind the power of Transformers.

I am seeking a Ph.D. position or Research Assistant role for Fall 2025.
