I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Health Sciences](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/health-sciences/) at Northeastern University, as well as an Impact Engine Fellow of the [Real-World Healthcare Navigator](https://impactengines.northeastern.edu/ie/rwhn/). 

I obtained my PhD in [Biostatistics at Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), advised by [Professor Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/tianxi-cai/) and [Professor Lorenzo Trippa](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/lorenzo-trippa/). I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in [Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/about), advised by [Professor Sharon-Lise Normand](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/people/sharon-lise-normand). I received an AM in Biostatistics from Harvard, an MPhil in Healthcare Operations from the University of Cambridge, an MA in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University, and a BS in Public Health and Biostatistics from UNC - Chapel Hill.

[My research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iZnTmxMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) focuses on developing novel statistical methods to leverage real-world data to improve decision-making in public health and clinical medicine, including robust and efficient estimation and inference of treatment effects using large-scale data generated from electronic health records and clinical trial data. Active areas of research include causal inference, conformal inference, data integration, federated and transfer learning, and sensitivity analysis.

I enjoy playing golf, especially in my home state of North Carolina, reading history, especially biographies, and staying up-to-date with global affairs, especially US-China relations. Feel free to reach out via email: [lar.han@northeastern.edu](lar.han@northeastern.edu).
