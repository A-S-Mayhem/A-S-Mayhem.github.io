I am Ethan Landers, a senior at Old Dominion University majoring in computer science. I am also enrolled in Old Dominion University’s computer science-linked master’s program. I will graduate with my bachelor’s degree in the spring of 2024 and my master’s degree in the spring of 2025. I am also an Old Dominion University Perry Honors College member. I have an overall 3.93 GPA and a 3.91 departmental GPA.

## Work Experience
I participated from 2021 to 2023 in a program called [NASA@MyLibrary](https://science.nasa.gov/sciact-team/nasa-at-my-library/), affiliated with NASA and Old Dominion University.  Through this program, I collaborated with peers and mentors to create and virtually present STEM educational programs for libraries nationwide.  I educated young audiences on topics such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Python, and what a computer science degree may entail, providing learning outlets for young audiences with limited access to STEM educational resources.

From January to April 2023, I participated in an experiential learning program through Old Dominion University called [Innovate Cyber](https://www.odu.edu/asis/innovatecyber).  During this period, I collaborated within a three-member team to create a [cyber hygiene prototype](https://sites.google.com/odu.edu/cyberhygieneprototype/home) using design thinking principles.

In the summer of 2022, I conducted full-time research through Old Dominion University’s disinformation detection and analytics [Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)](https://www.odu.edu/academics/research-experiences/reu/cis) program funded through the National Science Foundation. In that program, I developed a data set to test COVID-19 scientific claim verification models using Python and Unix. 

## Publications
I was [published](https://reuns2023.hotcrp.com/paper/21?cap=hcav21iDTrHiRUNCxdztUQbDPKtQzA) as coauthor for my REU research findings in a publication titled **MSVEC: A Multidomain Testing Dataset for Scientific Claim
Verification** in the 8th National Workshop for REU Research in Networking and Systems (REUNS 2023).

## Leadership
I also have led Old Dominion University's [Association for Computing Machinery's Council on Women in Computing (ACMW)](https://odu.campusgroups.com/acmw/home/) as vice president from August 2022 to the present.  I have helped with event planning and encouraging campus engagement from various students, including women and underrepresented groups.  We aim to create an inclusive and diverse university environment for individuals to pursue their STEM goals.  

## Awards
Since my enrollment at Old Dominion University, I have earned three scholarship awards: the **Cranmer-Skinner Honors Scholarship** in 2023, the **Richard T. and Nancy P. Cheng Award in Computer Science** in 2022, and the **Old Dominion University Presidential Scholarship** in 2020.
