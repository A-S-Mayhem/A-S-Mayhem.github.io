Welcome to my personal webpage!

I pursue my __PhD in Experimental Finance__ at Radboud University, the Netherlands, which I expect to finish in July 2024.

As a behavioral economist I have a passion for the psychology of risky choice. My research delves into the intricate ties between individual risk perceptions and investment behaviors, spanning both short and long-term horizons. Consider this scenario: Faced with an upcoming salary bonus, do we splurge on a skiing trip or contribute to our retirement savings? Such decisions hinge on a myriad of factors, which I explore in my research. 

Other research interests:
- Intertemporal Choice
- Asset Pricing
- Human-Machine Interaction
