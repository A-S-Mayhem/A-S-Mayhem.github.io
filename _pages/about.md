Hi there! I am Giulio, a masterâ€™s degree student enrolled in the Business and Administration course at 
                          University of Bologna (Italy), who is only missing the writing of his thesis before graduating (I expect to 
                          graduate by March 2023 at the latest). 
                          My level of English is advanced (C1 certified) and my master's degree was taught completely in English, the course being international, as well as my Erasmus+ international experience.
                          I have recently been an Erasmus+ Exchange Student at SGH, Warsaw School of Economics for the Winter Semester 2021/2022 (GPA 4.0/4.0). My main areas of interest and expertise relate Behavioral Economics, Entrepreneurship, Strategic Management,Performance Management, M&A, Corporate Governance, Business Strategy, Business Intelligence and Private Equity.
                          
  As for my professional experience, I recently completed a two-month remote intensive internship (March-May 2022) as a Business Analyst for OESON, in which I applied what I learned in the Business Intelligence course, in terms of producing 
                          complex measures with DAX language, creating interactive dashboards, cleaning and preprocessing of data, using R for hypothesis testing and correlation analysis, and ultimately received a Letter of 
                          Recommendation from the CEO of the company for commitment and merit in all tasks performed in my domain.I have achieved such result studying throughout my master's degree (two years in September 2022) Power BI in the 
                          Business Intelligence course (completed with honors) related to the use of DAX language (creation of complex measures, calculated columns, time intelligence) and interactive dashboards. However, my passion for the world of Data Analysis does not end in the software learned so far; in fact, 
                          I am very eager to constantly continue to learn new tools to expand my analytical and technical knowledge, such as Tableau, SQL, and any other software that is necessary to learn for my professional career.
                          
   In addition, in parallel with my studies and the Business Analyst studies, I am also having another part-time internship (March-September 2022) as Business Development Lead for The THRIVE Project. This is an Australian Non-profit and this role has let me apply 
                          my knowledge built during my academic path in strategy and analytics, analyzing market dynamics and very different industries characteristics, with the aim of pointing out which are the best moves for a business to spread its vision and mission. But not only that. Working for an organization with such a 
                          focus on environmental sustainability has also allowed me to play the role of a researcher.
