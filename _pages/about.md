Hailing from the southern state of Kerala in India, I have always had a love for nature and curiosity to understand how it worked. As I grew, this curiosity and love for nature evolved into a passion which led me to study Earth Science. Currently, I am a graduate member of the [Water and Climate Lab](https://vmishra.people.iitgn.ac.in/water&climate/index.html) at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/).<br>
Initially, my interests were in understanding the Solid Earth, particularly the chemical evolution of the Earth. I gathered in-depth knowledge about the different processes that take place inside and on the Earth during my time at [Pondicherry University](https://www.pondiuni.edu.in/). Following this, I joined the [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (ISRO)](https://www.iirs.gov.in/), where I understood the importance and effectiveness of Earth observation data to solve problems related to the Earth system. It was at this point, my interests shifted to issues relating to the Earth system as a whole rather than just the Solid Earth.<br>
To get a better understanding of the Earth and Climate systems, I joined the Earth System Sciences program at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/). Here I was introduced to concepts such as systems thinking, planetary boundaries, feedbacks and resilience, which drastically changed my outlook and understanding of the Earth. I also enhanced my knowledge of the water cycle and my skills in analysing Earth data.
