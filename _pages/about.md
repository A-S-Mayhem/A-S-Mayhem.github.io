I am a Data Scientist at UnitedHealthcare. My work revolves around the marketing analytics and member targeting using machine learning and statistical analysis. I am currently delving into the intricacies of  causal inference.

In my free time, I like exploring National Parks, playing badminton, crocheting and indulging in [photography](https://unsplash.com/@rputtam).
