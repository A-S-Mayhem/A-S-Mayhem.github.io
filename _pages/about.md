Hi there! I am Fazilet, a second-year PhD student at the University of Cambridge. I have a special interest in machine learning (ML) implementations for image processing problems. During my PhD, I would like to develop efficient methods to enhance or manipulate images and expand their applications for 3D scene manipulations.

My current research aims at integrating ML methods with well-known artist-created models to retouch photos. Professional artist retouches usually do not only adjust tone and color but also modify texture with fine details. Therefore, photographers spend a considerable amount of time on the design of their retouches. With ML techniques steered by such artist-created models, I would like to reduce the complexity of such retouching techniques. 


Sometimes I try to summarize papers about the subjects I am interested in as it is a good writing practice and a helper to understand a subject better. You can find some of my summaries in [Blog Posts](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/year-archive/).

<!-- My research aims at designing efficient learning-based methods integrated with artist-created models to manipulate 3D scenes in 2D settings. By imposing some prior knowledge on the nature of the task or the data itself, photographers and 3D artists design such edits that comprise a series of global adjustments and more detailed local changes. My work aims at automating this editing pipeline with the help of advances in machine learning methods along with well-established artist-created techniques.

As for my research experience, I worked part-time in an image-based weed detection project, in which we aimed at developing a system that can reliably detect blackgrass in cereal crops. We met the final milestone of the project, in which our model trained with a custom and novel dataset achieved 80% accuracy in blackgrass detection. Before joining Cambridge Computer Lab, I worked on two different research projects. One is about molecular communications, where we designed a novel molecular communications system. In the end, we published the results in IEEE-TMBMC. The other project is for my master's dissertation on super-resolution (SR), in which I achieved a distinction. I implemented different SR techniques and analyzed the results from a signal processing perspective (For details of all these projects, please visit [Projects](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/projects/)).

In addition to my research experiences, I also worked as a freelance software engineer from February until October 2020. During this period, I developed a mobile app using image hashcoding algorithms as well as creating custom widgets within Kivy framework in Python.


<!-- I am a female electronics engineer from Turkey, who don't really like being addressed as Mr Gokbudak! Except for Turkey, I lived in Germany for around seven months as a summer school and exchange student. Also, I studied my master's in the UK at the University of Edinburgh. You can find my educational experiences about these countries in [Blog Posts](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/year-archive/).
