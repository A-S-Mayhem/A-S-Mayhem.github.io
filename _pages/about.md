I am a lecturer in the <a href="https://computer.haut.edu.cn">College of Information Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.haut.edu.cn">Henan University of Techonology</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 2019 from <a href="http://www.combinatorics.net.cn">Center for Combinatorics</a>, <a href="http://www.nankai.edu.cn">Nankai University</a>.

My research interests include computer vision, machine learning and computational graphics, focusing specifically on image/video stitching, image manipulation, texture synthesis and image-to-image translation.
