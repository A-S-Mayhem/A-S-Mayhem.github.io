## About Me

I am a PhD student working on building photovoltaic applications. Especially, my work focuses on modelling failures as well as quantifying diagnostic methods in order to build a performance garantee on solar installations. My personal belief is that research owes to find solutions to mitigate the human environmental impact.

## Where I come from 

Originally from the mountainy area of Grenoble in France, I have been educated through two MSc in Engineering and Sustainable Energy respectively from CentraleSupelec (France) and DTU (Denmark). 

On my spare time, I love adventuring in the mountains, breathing fresh air and embracing the beauty of nature. My activities include hiking, ski-touring, climbing but also doing judo.

## Contact

I am always happy to discuss new projects and collaborations.
