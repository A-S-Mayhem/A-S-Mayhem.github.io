I'm a fourth year Economics PhD student at Binghamton university. I specialize in developing agent-based simulations and have ample experience bringing them to data, which can be used to more flexibly and realistically model human decision making processes and interactions between economic agents. I also have a knack for a wide array of stochastic optimization methods and can comfortably apply them to complex problems.

While I see my interest more-so aligned with the aforementioned methods, many of my current interests fall into one of two categories: 1. Investigating applications of stochastic optimization methods and cognitive science models as decision theories for economic modelling and forecasting, 2. The development of generative complex models to better understand the emergence of sustainable governance, and applications of such models to regulation development.
