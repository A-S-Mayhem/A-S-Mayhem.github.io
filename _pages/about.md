I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. My research interests includes GPU accelerated high performance computing, computer architecture, machine learning, and large graph analytics. I am honored to be advised by Professor [Hang Liu](https://personal.stevens.edu/~hliu77/). I completed my undergraduate from Tribhuvan University, Nepal where my undergraduate advisor was Professor [Subarna Shakya](http://doece.pcampus.edu.np/index.php/prof-dr-subarna-shakya/).
You can see my publications in the `publication` tab or at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4jtGttIAAAAJ) for my most recent publications.

The theme of my research is **system for machine learning and machine learning for system**.  

I enjoy hiking, playing basketball and football during my free time.
