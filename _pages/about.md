Hi, My name is Linfang Wang, I am currectly a third year Ph.D. student in Department of Electrical & Compuater Engineering, UCLA. I am working with Professor [Richard Wesel](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/richard-wesel/) and Professor [Divsalar Daruish](https://scienceandtechnology.jpl.nasa.gov/people/d_divsalar) in Communication and System Laboratory. 


My research interests are inforamtion theory and coding theory. More specifically, I am working on non-uniform quantization LDPC decoder construction and find fabulous protograph based LDPC code. Besides, I am also interested in the combination between information bottleneck and deep neural network. 

$\begin{align} \max_l \frac{p_l-\tilde{p}_l}{p_{l-1}-p_l}&<\delta,\quad \delta \ll 1  \end{align}$


 \newline \tilde{p}_l <p_{l-1}, 1\leq l\leq m
 \frac{|p_l-\tilde{p}_l|}{p_{l-1}-p_l}<\delta, \delta \ll 1 
 .
