I'm a doctoral researcher at UCL's Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Intensive Science working with the AstroInfo group at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory.

My previous research experience includes cosmology and astrostatistics, computational biology, adaptive networks and molecular dynamics simulations. I am enthusiastic about applying the methods of data science to a variety of research fields, technology and finance.
