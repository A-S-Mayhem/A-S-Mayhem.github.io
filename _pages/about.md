I am a *Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiter* (Scientific Researcher) and a first year Ph.D. student under the guidance of [Professor Kristina Yordanova](http://stenialo.org/about-me/) at the [Institute of Data Science](https://datascience.uni-greifswald.de/), University of Greifswald. 

My research goal involves developing natural language processing methods, including named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and entity linking, as well as machine learning methods for semantic learning graphs and data fusion techniques for enhancing textual knowledge. Additionally, I will be creating a prototype implementation of these methods and supervising student assistants in their research-related work.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a research assistant at the [University of Rostock](https://www.mmis.informatik.uni-rostock.de/staff/), where I delved into Neural Density Estimation for the project [NEISS](https://www.neiss.uni-rostock.de/en/). I also had the opportunity to hone my skills as a Software Engineer at [PLANET AI](https://planet-ai.de/), where I contributed to the development and testing of [Intelligent Document Analysis](https://planet-ai.de/products/ida/) software.

 <h2>Research</h2>
 
 - My present research is under the co-supervision of [Dr. Emma L Tonkin](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Emma-Tonkin-47cb2fc5-62d3-4efc-9127-795bf5af66f9/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). It pertains to investigating methodologies for keyword extraction from submitted papers in the [ARDUOUS](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=169425&copyownerid=177258) workshop, along with clustering of the extracted keywords, with the primary aim of identifying research trends and their evolution over time. 
 
 - My [Master thesis](https://dipendrayadaveee.github.io/files/Master_Thesis_Yadav_Dipendra.pdf) research investigated the use of Transfer Learning on Deep NLP systems for languages with limited annotation.

 - During my [Specialization](https://dipendrayadaveee.github.io/files/Yadav_Dipendra_Specialization_Electrical_Engineering.pdf) research, I worked on Automatic Object detection for Video-based intention recognition on CMU Quality of life grand challenge kitchen dataset.

<h2>More</h2>

- Hailing from Nepal, I find immense pleasure in delving into the pages of books, indulging in movies, socializing with like-minded individuals, and embarking on refreshing bicycle rides.

- As a coordinator and event manager for International Founders at [Grundungswerft](https://gruendungswerft.com/en/locations/rostock/), I have the privilege of helping ambitious individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds kickstart their entrepreneurial dreams in Mecklenburg Vorpommern, Germany.
