I am a first year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania working in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision under the supervision of Prof. Chris Callison-Burch and Prof. Mark Yatskar. 

Aside from my research, I co-lead Penn's Team for the [Amazon Alexa Taskbot Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/academic-engagements/amazon-launches-new-alexa-prize-taskbot-challenge). If you have an Alexa device you can say "Alexa, assist me!" to interact with one of the team's bots and help give anonymous feedback! Note your feedback is valuable so it is important to be reflective of your experience. 

Brief Background
======
I graduated from the Dual Degree Program of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pennsylvania with a BAS and an MSE in Computer and Information Science, a BA (Hons) in Cognitive Science, and a BA (Hons) in Philosophy. During that time at Penn I worked at GRASP Lab under the supervision of Prof. Kostas Daniilidis on estimating Optical Flow with Spiking Neural Networks. My current interests pertain to the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with specific applications of task guiding dialogue systems. 

After finishing my MSE I took a gap year to create a startup in the field of medicine redistribution funded by Penn's President's Engagement Prize.
