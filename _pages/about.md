I am an [Old Dominion University](https://odu.edu/) graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science, where I expect to graduate by Spring 2025.

Technology, understanding different cultures, and continual learning have always been central to my life.  I thrive on the excitement of generating creative and innovative solutions within a collaborative setting while continually learning from others and my own experiences.

I am an organizer for two large Southwest Florida tech Meetup groups:
* [Python SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/pythonswfl/)
  - Volunteer-run interdisciplinary user group for exploration and experimentation with the Python programming language.
  - Over 350 members.
* [Tech Alliance of SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/techallianceswfl/)
  - A collective of technology groups and industry leaders dedicated to fostering innovation, promoting technology education, and driving the growth of technology in Southwest Florida.
  - Over 700 members itself and 2000 members combined between all member groups.

I am passionate about technology, communication, travel, concerts, and mastering Spanish.
