Welcome to my website. I am a KIPAC Post-doctoral Fellow in Astrophysics at Stanford. I am interested in a wide range of topics in physical and observational cosmology. I am currently working with Prof. Risa Wechsler and Prof. Daniel Eisenstein on novel cosmological statistics and galaxy-halo connection models. Some of my topics include the galaxy three-point correlation function (3PCF) in the squeeze limit, generalized halo occupation models, assembly bias, and galaxy-galaxy lensing. We are also broadly interested in methodologies that improve clustering measurements and their interpretations.

I recently completed my PhD in Astrophysics with Prof. Daniel Eisenstein at Harvard. Before that, I got my Bachelors degree in Astrophysics at Princeton, where I worked on various exciting projects such as identifying obscured quasars in SDSS, looking for ultra diffuse galaxies in HSC, and simulating progenitor gas clouds in the early Universe. 

I have been widely involved in teaching and outreach. At Harvard, I was a teaching assistant for ASTRO 17 and ASTRO 130. I was a founding member of Open Labs At Harvard, with the goal of promoting science and research education among underpriviledged K-12 students in the Greater Boston area. Aside from work, I enjoy tennis, DJing, and cooking.
