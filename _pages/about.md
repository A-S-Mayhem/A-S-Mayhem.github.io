Hello! Welcome to my web page. 

I am a first-year doctoral student at Aalto University. I am working on an interdisciplinary project in the LeTech (Learning + Technology) research group. My thesis aims to improve our ability to provide automatic feedback to students who struggle with programming assignments. For this purpose, I aim to leverage recent advances in deep learning models. Stay tuned!

## This website

It is currently a bit empty since I just started my doctoral studies. My goal is to use these pages to present who I am, showcase my work, and share my thoughts with others. I will write in these pages primarily as an exercise, because I believe part of being a researcher is being able to communicate effectively with others, both in person and online.
