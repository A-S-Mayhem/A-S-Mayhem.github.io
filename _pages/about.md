I'm a MSc. student in the [Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/Human-Centered-Artificial-Intelligence) programme at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). I have a strong background in machine learning and I'm currently writing my thesis on optimization methods relying on differential geometry for improved generalization.

Before starting the MSc. I obtained my BSc. degree in [Articifial Intelligence and Data](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/undergraduate/undergraduate-programmes-in-danish/bsc-eng-programmes/artificial-intelligence-and-data) at DTU.

My research interests
------
I'm particularly interested in the theoretical aspects of machine learning and deep learning. Currently, I'm focusing on the following topics:

* Differental geometry for machine learning 
* Deep learning theory
* Explainability and interpretability of deep learning models
* Probabilistic machine learning

What is this site for? 
======

The purpose of this website is to give any interested reader an insight into the aspects of Machine Learning and Data Science that I've been working with. My main motivation has been to create a platform for me to experiment with writing [blog posts about my daily encounters with Data Science](https://albertkjoller.github.io/posts).  -->
