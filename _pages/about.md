Welcome!
======
I am a Research Assistant in FullStack Security Lab([FSSL](http://tristartom.github.io/members.html)) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/) now and I will be a Ph.D. in Fall 2020. I am honorable to be supervised by [Dr. Yuzhe (Richard) Tang](http://tristartom.github.io/). My research interests lie in Blockchain.

I received an M.S. in Computer & Information Science from [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/) in 2020, B.S. in Software Engineering from [Hubei University](http://www.hubu.edu.cn) in 2019.
