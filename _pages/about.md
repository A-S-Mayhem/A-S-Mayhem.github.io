About
======
I am a quantitative social scientist. 

Currently, I mainly study wealth inequality with a focus on the family, gender, and the superrich.


I work in the <u><a href="https://www.mpifg.de/research/wealth-and-social-inequality">Research Group on Wealth and Social Inequality</a></u> at <u><a href="https://mpifg.de">the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne, Germany</a></u>.
