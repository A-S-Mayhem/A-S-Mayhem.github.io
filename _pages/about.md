Welcome to the page! My name is Felipe and I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the Neuroscience Graduate Group at Penn. I study the neural and kinematic basis of social grooming in primates under the co-tutelage of Michael Platt and Konrad Kording. He studies the neural basis of social primate grooming and spends his time building deep learning-based tools to analyze natural primate behavior and wirelessly recorded neural data. Felipe also studies how we can use deep reinforcement learning approaches (imitation learning and inverse RL) to model animal strategies in social contexts.

I am from Buenos Aires, Argentina, but I completed much of my education in Miami, FL. For undergrad, I studied Neuroscience and Economics at the University of Miami (go Canes!) from 2015-2019. At UM, I hopped from lab to lab, and finally found my way towards Dr. Elizabeth Losin's Social & Cultural Neuroscience Lab, where I helped collect data for work on neurolinguistic pain modulation in Spanish-English bilinguals. Following graduation, I worked as a Psychometrician for First Choice Neurology under Dr. Rafael Rivas-Vazquel, where I built and administed psychometric assessments to individuals with neuropsychological disorders. Outside of the lab, I love to play soccer, people-watch at Clark Park, and rearrange my furniture.
