I'm undergraduate student at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), where I'm diving deep into the realms of machine learning, diffusion model, large language models(LLMs), and trustworthy AI. I have the privilege of working as a research assistant under the mentorship of [Professor Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io/) at the University of Hong Kong and [Professor Hao Wang](http://www.wanghao.in/) at Rutgers University. 


Recent Papers and Topics of Interest
====
As a researcher in the field of AI, I think it is important to keep reading a certain amount of papers every day. Therefore, I set up this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Tyrion58/daily-paper-trail) to record and track my daily paper reading. You can find the topics that I am interested in recently.
