My name is Matthew Craig and I'm a Ph.D. candidate who is on the market at [Kent State University's College of Communication & Information](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj26YSc6uj1AhXBIDQIHSaWDdsQFnoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kent.edu%2Fcci&usg=AOvVaw04BGhcYaaYgr9IEWDwWGxl). I'm a human-machine communication scholar who applies interpersonal communication to study how people create meaning with and through technology via communication. The context for my current research concerns the presence of inequities in the access, use, and outcomes of technology, particularly at the intersections of surveillance, privacy management, and techno-social practices.
