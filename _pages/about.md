I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University's Engineering Science (ENSC) department, deeply passionate about research in computer vision and deep learning. I chose to pursue a Ph.D. in this field because I believe it has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, and autonomous driving is just one example of how this technology can make a significant impact. My career goal is to become a leading computer vision researcher and contribute to the advancement of technology for our generation or futures.

Currently, I am dedicated to exploring the intersections of Information Theory and Deep Learning, with a specific focus on developing learned image codecs for machines. I am experienced in Python programming, both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks, and have been actively engaged with neural networks since 2016.

My research interests include:

* Object Detection and Segmentation
* Learned Image and Video Compression
* Scalable Image Codecs for Humans and Machines

Some of the projects that I have recently worked on or contributed to are:

* Base Layer Efficiency in Scalable Human-Machine Coding
* Rate-Distortion Theory in Coding for Machines and its Applications
* VVC+M: Plug and Play Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines


I engage in diverse hobbies and passions. I go to gym three times a week for a dynamic mix of weightlifting and TRX, nurturing both my fitness and overall well-being. I find satisfaction in solving puzzles, as a mental exercise and also a source of enjoyment. While I once immersed myself in crime and mystery movies, due to scarcity of finding one, I switched to historical documentaries and podcasts, with a particular focus on the World War II and Cold War eras.
