My name is Kia Rahmani and I am a PhD student of computer science at Purdue University. 
I am a member of the [programming languages group](https://purpl.cs.purdue.edu/), 
working under the supervision of 
Professor [Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/) 
and 
Professor [Benjamin Delaware](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bendy/)
.
The main topics of my research interests include formal methods of modeling, analysis and verification of applications. 
I specifically focus on automated debugging/generation of
verifiably correct and scalable distributed database applications.
