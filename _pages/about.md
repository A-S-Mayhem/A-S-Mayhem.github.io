About me
======
I am a PhD. Student in Computational Molecular Biology at the [Center for Computational Molecular Biology at Brown](https://ccmb.brown.edu). My reseearch interests are brodly at the intersection of computational modeling, computer science, statistics and biology. Specifically I am interested in developing methods to understand and evaluate disease progression and drug resistance.  

Before coming to Brown, I recieved my Bachlor of Science in May of 2022 at Boston University's College of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering. I did my bachlor thesis titled "Quantitative System Analysis of Healthcare Access among Native Americans in Rosebud, SD", with [Dr. Muhammad Zaman](https://www.bu.edu/zaman/profile/muhammad-zaman/) and Taylor Schissel (current PhD Student at the University of Michigan). This project was awarded second place for the Societal Impact Award of all senior theses at the College of Engineering at Boston University and semi-finalist at the Rice 360 Global Health Technology Design Competition 2022. During my bachelors, I also researched with [Dr. Franziska Michor](http://michorlab.dfci.harvard.edu) at Dana-Faber Cancer Institute on a modeling framework for estimating tumor evolutionary modes from single-cell RNA sequencing data.

Before moving to the US in 11th grade (2016), I was raised and lived in Frankfurt Germany.
