About me
======
I am a Marie Curie research fellow for [POLISS](https://poliss.eu/) project and a 
PhD candidate at Utrecht University. My PhD thesis investigates the impact of artificial intellligence
on labour market inequalities and the future of work. 

I graduated from Master in Public Administration degree 
from London School of Economics and Political Science specialising in Public and Economic Policy. 
Before joining Utrecht, I worked with academia and international organisations on digitalisation, 
climate change, and gender equality.
