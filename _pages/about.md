About Me
======

I am a second year PhD student in Statistics at Baylor University. I graduated in 2021 from Brigham Young University with a B.S. in Statistical Science and a minor in mathematics.

While at BYU, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant for a year working on Bayesian models for estimating elemental profiles of potential pollution source profiles and their contributions at various locations. It was an interesting project that dealt with noisy environmental data consisting of *Rhizoplaca melanophthalma* samples across the intermountain west. This project resulted in my first co-authored [publication](https://trgrimm.github.io/publications/).

While at Baylor, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of different projects that have helped me develop my skills as a statistician and data scientist. As part of my duties as a graduate assistant at Baylor, I:

* Assisted in the development of a multi-day data science workshop for professionals in the water/wastewater treatment industry.
* Worked as a statistical consultant studying and applying various statistical methods to help clients understand their data on a case-by-case basis.

Currently, I am doing research on improving multivariate statistical methods for fault detection in complex processes with specific applications in potable water reuse.
