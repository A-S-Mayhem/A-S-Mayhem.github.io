I am currently working as a research assistant and pursuing my Ph.D. in Economics at the [Chair of Economic Policy and Economic Research](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/wirtschaft/vwl/wuw) at Dresden University of Technology. As an applied microeconomist, my primary focus is on political economy. My research examines the relationship between policy and voting behavior, with a particular emphasis on how various factors influence electoral outcomes. I explore topics such as the role of information in voting decisions and turnout, the effects of administrative failures on voter participation, and the impact of candidate characteristics. Ultimately, my work aims to provide valuable insights into the intersection of economics, politics, and social decision-making.
