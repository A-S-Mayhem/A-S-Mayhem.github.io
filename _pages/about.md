I am a third-year Applied Mathematics Ph.D. candidate in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) at [Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu), working with Prof. [Flavio Calmon](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/#). My main research interests are fairness, information theory, and machine learning applications for the social good. Before joining Harvard, I received an M.s. in Computational Mathematics and Modelling from Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada ([IMPA](https://impa.br/en_US/)) in Brazil. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z0AaWf8GAbnr3_dJpNpaBEi9YeDHmfPm/view?usp=sharing).

## Recent announcements
<span style="color: FireBrick"> 
January 2023 - Our [paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26837) received the Innovative Applications of AI award from AAAI. 
</span> \
<span style="font-size:15px"> 
In this paper, we developed an ML solution that combines deep learning and conformal prediction to output fast and accurate volume estimates and segmentation masks from fetal MRI. The proposed solution in the paper was deployed by the biggest clinical diagnosis company in Latin America.

July 2022 - I received the [Fundação Estudar](https://www.estudar.org.br) Leadership Fellowship. 
</span> \
<span style="font-size:15px"> 
The Fellowship aims to support, bring together, and develop Brazil's most promising young leaders that can generate positive transformations in their sector of activity. I was one of the 30 fellows selected out of 33k **(0.08% selected)**.
