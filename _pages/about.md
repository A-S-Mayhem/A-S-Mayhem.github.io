I an economics PhD student at Northwestern University with research interests in health and macro-labor. Prior to Northwestern, I studied (and [ran!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eidacczk0gg)) for the University of Chicago, served as an AmeriCorps VISTA at the [IndyEast Promise Zone](https://indyeast.org), and worked as pre-doc (more on that here).
