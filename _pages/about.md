Since June 2023, I am a postdoc in the [ARGO](https://www.di.ens.fr/argo/) team of Inria Paris and [DI ENS](https://www.di.ens.fr/) (computer science department of Ecole Normale Supérieure), working with [Kevin Scaman](https://kscaman.github.io/) on Personalized Federated Learning. Being part of the [FedMalin](https://www.inria.fr/fr/fedmalin) Inria challenge, I also work in close collaboration with [Aurélien Bellet](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/) and [Giovanni Neglia](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/).

Before that, I was a postdoc in the [MAGNET](https://team.inria.fr/magnet/) team at Inria Lille with Prof. [Marc Tommasi](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/tommasi/), Aurélien Bellet and Prof. [Anne-Marie Kermarrec](https://people.epfl.ch/anne-marie.kermarrec) (EPFL). 

In January 2021, I completed a PhD in applied mathematics at Centre Borelli, ENS Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of Prof. [Nicolas Vayatis](https://nvayatis.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) and [Argyris Kalogeratos](https://kalogeratos.com/psite/). My thesis work focused on statistical learning problems for data observed over graph structures, with applications to anomaly and change-point detection.

Prior to my thesis, I obtained a master in mathematics, computer vision and machine learning (MVA) at ENS Paris-Saclay.

You can learn more about me, like the fact that I practice surfing and climbing ;-), on my [CV](http://batistelb.github.io/files/cv-new.pdf).
