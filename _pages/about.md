Thanks for stopping by!

I am a PhD student at [KAIST](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/) with a background in statistical learning, information theory, and optimization. My research interests span image processing/computer vision, statistical signal processing, diffusion models, and automated machine learning. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Sungju Hwang](http://www.sungjuhwang.com), and I am extremely grateful to have my research supported by the KAIST Presidential PhD Scholarship. I also collaborate closely with the [Samsung AI Research Lab](https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr/saithome/research/researchArea.do?idx=14). Recently, I have been focusing on combining approaches from graph representation learning and stable diffusion models to generate neural network weights in a resource-efficient manner.

Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with High Honors with majors from the [Mathematics Department](https://math.berkeley.edu/) and [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), where I had the pleasure of being advised by [Prof Bruno Olshausen](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/people/bruno-olshausen/) and [Prof Jack Gallant](https://gallantlab.org/) in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) in my undergraduate research. There, I worked on theoretical visual neuroscience and unsupervised learning methods for computer vision. As an undergraduate, I was also a research intern at [UC Irvine](https://engineering.uci.edu/dept/eecs).

After graduating and before beginning my PhD, I worked as a research engineer at NYU and as a machine learning engineer, where I learned more about how to deploy machine learning in production-quality software, and how to engineer scalable data pipelines.

Besides my main research interests, I'm also interested in computational geometry, as well as in applications of functional analysis and differential geometry to machine learning. I enjoy teaching others about what I've learned and was previously a TA at Berkeley.

In my free time (which is unfortunately very limited nowadays), I like to cook: recently I've been into Italian. Also, I play the violin as a hobby. 

If you are a PhD student or postdoc at KAIST with overlapping research interests, and you want to collaborate with me on a research project, you are welcome to email me at lchen64@kaist.ac.kr or lchen64@berkeley.edu.
