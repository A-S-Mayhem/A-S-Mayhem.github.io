### **Biography**
Dr. Yujie Wu is currently a Research Assistant Professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). Prior to joining PolyU, he was a postdoctoral researcher collaborating with Prof. Wolfgang Maass, a pioneer in spiking neural networks, at the Institute of Theoretical Computer Science, Graz University of Technology, from October 2021 to January 2024. During this period, he focused on brain-like computation and computational neuroscience. His doctoral research, conducted at Tsinghua University under the supervision of Prof. Luping Shi and Prof. Jun Zhu, centered on brain-inspired computing (2016-2021).

### **Featured research**
He is dedicated to (1) Exploring the computational principles of the brain, with a specific emphasis on underlying learning mechanisms such as STDP and BTSP; (2) Leveraging these insights to develop brain-inspired general intelligence with exceptional computational and learning efficiency (such as robustness, adaptability, and few-shot learning capabilities)

In the past five years, his work have been recognized in prestigious journals and top AI conferences, including ***Nature*** (cover paper), ***Science Robotics*** (cover paper), ***Nature Computational Science***, ***Nature Communications***, IEEE TNNLs and AAAI, with about 4.8k google scholar citations. Two of his works have been selected as ESI Top 1% Highly Cited Papers. Two papers have been selected as featured papers by Nature Communications. One of his papers was awarded Best Paper of the Year by the Journal of Control and Decision, and three of his related works have been successfully converted into patents. His participated Tianjic chip project was recognized as one of the top 10 sci-tech achievements in China in 2019.
