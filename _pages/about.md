Pradeep, a Senior Homomorphic Encryption Researcher at the [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/cryptography) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, leads cutting-edge research in homomorphic encryptionâ€”a groundbreaking paradigm for secure computation preserving privacy during data processing.

Before joining the Technology Innovation Institute, Pradeep earned a Master's in Mathematics from IIT Hyderabad, India, laying the foundation for his academic journey. He pursued a Ph.D. in the Mathematics department at [Kyushu University, Japan](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/), focusing on developing secure and efficient matrix multiplication techniques within homomorphic encryption. Following his doctorate, he expanded his expertise through postdoctoral research at [Zhejiang University, China](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

In his present role, Pradeep propels innovation within secure computing solutions, spearheading research initiatives, collaborating with industry experts, and contributing to the ongoing evolution of homomorphic encryption. Committed to pushing technological boundaries, he actively explores the development of cryptographic libraries and engages in multiparty computation endeavors.

Beyond his professional commitments, Pradeep ardently fosters knowledge sharing by serving as a mentor and lecturer in encryption and privacy-preserving technologies, inspiring the next generation of researchers and professionals.

Pradeep's interests extend beyond homomorphic encryption; he advocates for sustainable practices, actively participating in environmental conservation initiatives. During leisure, he immerses himself in exploring Abu Dhabi's rich cultural heritage, engaging in outdoor activities, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance through physical activity.
