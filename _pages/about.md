 I am a research fellow at Stanford (Rock Center and Olin Program in Law and Economics), where I also earned an MA in Economics and a JSM degree. My research focuses on the application of behavioral insights to competition policy, corporate governance, economic regulation, and the empirical analysis of law and its policy implications. I received my LL.B. summa cum laude from Universidad de Chile (2013), an LL.M. from Harvard Law School (2016), and a J.S.M. from Stanford Law School (2018), where I graduated with full-honors and was awarded my first John M. Olin Fellowship in Law and Economics. I am qualified to practice as a barrister in Chile, where I worked for the Chilean antitrust authority. I have taught seminars on antitrust and law and economics at Universidad de Chile and Econ 154 (Law and Economics) at the Stanford Department of Economics. Before coming to Stanford, I worked as a competition expert for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), conducting a competition assessment of the pharmaceutical sector in Mexico.
