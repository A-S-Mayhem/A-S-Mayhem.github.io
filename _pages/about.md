I recently graduated from Imperial College London with a MSci Physics with Theoretical Physics degree. I have gained experience in astrostatistics, adaptive networks and molecular dynamics simulations. I am currently working on a project focused on measures of immune repertoire diversity in collaboration with the Yale Breast Medical Oncology Group. I am enthusiastic about applying the methods of data science to research and industry.
