I am a PhD student in Natural Language Pocessing at the [NLP lab of Bar Ilan University](https://biu-nlp.github.io), supervised by Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty. I am also currently a visiting PhD student at [UW NLP](https://nlp.washington.edu) at the University of Washington.
This summer I had the pleasure of interning at the [AI2 Mosaic team](https://mosaic.allenai.org/people) in Seattle and I am very honored to have received the [AI2 Outstanding Intern of the Year Award](https://allenai.org/outstanding-interns).
Previously I did a research internship at Google, obtained an MSc from the University of Edinburgh and a BA from the University of Zurich. 

My research focuses on *discourse* phenomena and *pragmatics*. My main interest currently lies in question generation. I also often use QA representations to capture propositions and once in a while I look at the modality of events.

I also co-organized [the Second Workshop on Understanding Implicit and Underspecified Language](https://unimplicit2022.github.io/), collocated with NAACL-2022 in Seattle.

Besides this I love rowing (currently at Lake Washington Rowing Club) and going to the "cinemathèque". My Erdős number is 3.
