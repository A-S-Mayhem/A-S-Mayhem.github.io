Hello! I'm a Data Scientists currently finishing up my PhD at Lousiana State University. After graduation, I plan to transition to indstry and secure a role in the data science field.

I have two objectives in creating this site:

1. Showcase my skills and knowledge in the field of data science for potential future employers.
2. Throughout my past work experience, academic studies, and my current role as a graduate researcher I have picked up a few skills that I think others may find usefull. So, I am including a blog section and hope to contribute regularly.

Have a look around and reach out for questions or if you find anthing helpfull!
