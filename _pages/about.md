My background is in Engineering Physics. I studied for my masters at the Lund Institute of 
  Technology from 1991 to 1996, specializing in statistics and applied nuclear physics. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematical Statistics from UC. Berkeley 
  in 2001 under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu/"> Bin Yu</a>. I was a tenure track assistant professor at the Department of Statistics, Rutgers University 2002-2008 and was 
  promoted to tenure associate professor in 2008. I returned to Sweden in 2009, joining the department of <a href="http://www.chalmers.se/math/EN"> Mathematical Sciences</a>
<br><a href="http://www.gu.se/english/?languageId=100001&contentId=-1&disableRedirect=true&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gu.se%2F">University of Gothenburg/</a>
<a href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx">Chalmers</a> as an associate professor of mathematical statistics and was 
 subsequently promoted to professor of applied statistics and biostatistics in 2016. <p>
 Since 2018 I serve as

	<h2> What's new? </h2>
&bull; <b>PhD opening in computational statistics with applications to cancer biology</b>  <p> Start date TBA.
<p>
 <!--Two positions are funded through the joint WASP-DDLS call. -->
 This position is funded through the <a href="https://kaw.wallenberg.org/en/research-projects-2022"> Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.
<p>
Project: "The Routes of Glioblastoma and their Patient-Specific Vulnerabilities" </a> is coordinated through
<a  href="http://nelanderlab.org">Sven Nelander's group</a> at Uppsala. This PhD project centers on the development of new matrix- and tensor-imputation methods for 
accelerated drug discovery.  You would be
working closely with researchers in the Nelander lab on an innovative set of experiments that will be conducted to collect information on different
types of invasion.
