I am a quantitative ecologist interested in all things Arctic, predator-prey interactions, animal movement, climate change consequences, and ecological modelling. I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the [Statistical Ecology Research Group](http://statisticalecology.weebly.com) at the [Institute for the Oceans & Fisheries](http://oceans.ubc.ca) at the University of British Columbia.
