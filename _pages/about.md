His experience in software engineering:
======
Nguyen, Ngoc Hung started his journey of research when I was a student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. He deployed research with his labmate at the Motor Design Lab under the supervision of Prof. [Bui Minh Dinh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lACArY4AAAAJ) and Chemical Processing Lab under Prof. [Nguyen Dang Binh Thanh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uu5VPhcAAAAJ&hl=vi&oi=sra), here, He did researches in numerical methods, computer system, and motor design. This research then led him to receive a third award for the student research competition at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

He was a master's student at Hanyang University in Electronics under the supervision of Prof. [Sang-Woon Jeon](link).
