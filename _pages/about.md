======
I am a  recent Mathematics and Physics graduate. I completed a Mathematics Specialist and a Physics Major at the University of Toronto. I am passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning and Applied Mathematics. I have contributed to research in Applied Mathematics in the subfield field of Mathematical Biology/Dynamical Systems.

I am currently working with a group of Data Scientists at RiskLab on a project involving applying machine learning models to [portfolio optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization)
