Hey, welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a data scientist at [Department of Health and Social Care](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health-and-social-care) based in London, England. Currently working on probabilistic data linkage, anonymisation, cloud computing for big data, and transforming the data culture. I love working with people and using data to solve problems and to drive decision-making.

Before joining DHSC, I worked at [Office for Health Improvement and Disparities](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-health-improvement-and-disparities) and [Public Health England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england), to improve the health of the nation with data science.

I have a MEng in Mechanical Engineering from University of Southampton and over half way through my BSc in Data Science from York St John University.
