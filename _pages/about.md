I am Yusheng Su, a fourth-year Ph.D. at the [THUNLP Lab](https://twitter.com/tsinghuanlp), [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). I am advised by Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dT0v5u0AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW). I'm on the job market [(CV)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/teasf8a71rqo3z4/Yusheng_Su_Resume_2023_01_13.pdf?dl=0).

## Research
<!--My research interests are in the theory and practice of building machine learning systems that remain reliable when deployed in real application contexts. For example:-->


<!--My research spans the areas of natural language processing and machine learning. My long-term goal of research is to build a general-purpose machine learning system that has human-like cognitive capacities (e.g., understanding, reasoning, etc) and can generalize to various real-world applications efficiently.

My research spans the areas of natural language processing and machine learning. My long-term goal of research is to build a general-purpose machine learning system that can <b>sufficiently learn</b> human-like cognitive capacities (e.g., understanding, reasoning, etc), <b>efficiently adapt</b> to various task, and remain <b>reliable when deployed</b> in real applications.

Toward this goal, my work spans across:

* <b>General-purpose model.</b> Building pre-trained foundation models that can actively access to various data sources (e.g., knowledge bases, web pages, textual documents, etc) and acquire knowledge to improve the abilities of understanding, reasoning, etc. ([CokeBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13964), [CSS-LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03752), [CPM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266665102100019X))

* <b>Computational efficiency method.</b> Developing theory, tools, and algorithms to efficiently adapt <b>large-scale</b> pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks (e.g., prompt tuning methods, in-context learning, etc.). ([Prompt Transferability](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.290/), [IPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07867), [Delta Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06904))

* <b>AI alignment.</b> Designing methods to understand the capacities of contemporary foundation models and regularize them to perform tasks in accordance with human's real intentions. 

<!--
My research spans the areas of natural language processing and machine learning. At the current stage, I am particularly interested in <b>large-scale pre-trained models (LLMs)</b>. My research aims to build more general LLMs and develop efficient paradigms for them to deploy in real-world applications.

* <b>General LLMs.</b> Building LLMs that can actively access to various data sources (e.g., knowledge bases, web pages, textual documents, etc ) and acquire knowledge to accomplish new tasks.

* <b>Efficient Paradigms.</b> Developing theory, tools, and algorithms to efficiently adapt LLMs downstream tasks (e.g., parameter-efficient tuning methods, in-context learning, etc.).

<!--exploring the mechanism (theory) and mainpulation (practice) of <b>large-scale pre-trained models (LLMs)</b> to efficiently and effectively adapt to real-world applications. To achieve these goals, I focus on the following directions-->

To achieve these goals, I focus on the following directions:-->

<!--
* <b>Parameter-Efficient Tuning.</b> Adapting LLMs to downstream tasks incurs a huge computational burden. How can we adapt LLMs to downstream tasks efficiently (with less computational burden)? <!--Driving LLMs with minimal parameters (parameter-efficient tuning) is worth exploring.


* <b>Knowledge Acquisition From Multi-Modal Data.</b> Adapting LLMs to downstream tasks requires training on task-specific manually annotated data. How can we equip LLMs with the ability to actively acquire task-specific knowledge from multi-modal data in the open world?
-->


<!--Human-Like Cognitive Abilities and Human-computer interaction are the furthure direction that I want to explore-->


  
<!--<b>* <b>Human-Like Cognitive Abilities.</b> Adapting LLMs to downstream tasks requires training on task-specific manually annotated data, which needs manual effort involving labeling. How can we acquire task-specific knowledge effectively (without manual effort)? Equipping LLMs with human-like cognitive abilities to leverage open-world information is a promising direction.-->

<!--<b>AI4Science.</b> How many human-like capabilities LLMs learn in the pre-training stage remains unknown. To further understand, we develop tools to explore and conduct a series of analyses.-->



<!--My research interests lie within the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, particularly in pre-trained language models (PLMs). At the current stage, I am particularly studying how to effectively and efficiently adapt PLMs to complex downstream tasks. To achieve these goals, I specifically focus on knowledge-guided methods, transfer learning, in-context learning, and parameter-efficient tuning.-->
