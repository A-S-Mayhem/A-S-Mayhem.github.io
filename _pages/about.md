My name is Jingwu Tang(唐静吾). I am a third-year undergrad at Turing Class, Peking University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). During Fall 2021, I am pleased to have worked closely with [Zhe Feng](https://zfengharvard.github.io/). My research interest broadly lies in the intersection between economics, theoretical computer science and machine learning. Most recently, I've been thinking about how to design better mechanisms through machine learning approaches.
