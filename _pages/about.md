I am a senior Computer Science major and student researcher at Pomona College, currently applying to PhD programs in Computer Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning (ML), the security of ML systems and the use of ML – as well as other methods – towards approaching broader problems in the spaces of application, network, and systems security. Apart from this, I am also interested in genetic algorithms, privacy, and tech policy.

***The overarching goal that I wish to pursue as a researcher is to develop solutions that make technology used in daily life more secure and safe.***

These days, I am working on two projects related to this goal.
* **Securing Federated Learning Against Post-Breach Evasion Attacks**: I am researching and developing a novel evasion attack defense method for federated learning systems.
* **Adversarial Training for Sim-to-Real Transfer**: I am researching adversarial training and its potential benefits for the sim-to-real transferability of computer vision models in order to develop more safe, robust mobile robots.

Since May 2021, I have worked for the ARCS Lab, where I focus on researching and developing creative approaches to ease the pain of sim-to-real transfer. Through cybersecurity and software enginnering internships, I have also gained experience in building out ML-driven security solutions and mobile applications.
