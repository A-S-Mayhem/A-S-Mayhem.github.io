# A small, concise biography
- I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [School of Computer Science at Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), working under the guidance of Professor Jun Wu and Associate Professor [Hui Xu](https://hxuhack.github.io/). 
- I have earned my bachelor's degree from South China University of Technology ([SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/)), where I actively participated in competitive programming and was awarded two silver medalsðŸ¥ˆ in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).
- My recent research focuses on vulnerability detection in Rust libraries. I am keen to explore various techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities in Rust libraries to enhance the reliability of the Rust ecosystem. 
- In addition, I am also interested in the topic of the Rust programming language (Design & Practise), memory safety.
