⭐️ About
-----
My name is Shukai Gong (龚舒凯). I'm a third year **Data Science** undergraduate student from the Renmin University of China. I also had an amazing experience in Spring 2024 as an exchange student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu). During my undergraduate studies, I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io) from GSAI and [Prof. Feng Zhou](http://zhoufeng6288.github.io) from the School of Statistics.

Visit my [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Shukai_Gong1) profile to see my research papers and reviews. For potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me via [shukai_gong@ruc.edu.cn](shukai_gong@ruc.edu.cn).
