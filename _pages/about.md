I am a third-year PhD student doing neuroscience research at the California Institute of Technology ([Caltech](https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/)). My advisor is Prof. [Markus Meister](https://meisterlab.caltech.edu/markusmeister). I am interested in cognitive flexibility, learning and memory in mice and humans. 

Prior to Caltech, I did my undergraduate studies at Cornell University (B.S. in Biological Engineering) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (B.Eng. in Food Science and Engineering). I then obtained a Master's degree in Education and Psychology at the University of Cambridge.

**2022/07/15** - I completed the (inaugural) Data Science and AI for Neuroscience summer school, at the Chen Institute for Neuroscience at [Caltech](https://twitter.com/CaltechN/status/1549145513550680064). 

**2022/05/13** - I presented a poster of our current work on the Manhattan Maze at the Chen Institute Retreat. The [project](https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/documents/21454/Guimaraes_Abstract_r2022.pdf) is in collaboration with [Rogério Guimarães](http://twitter.com/rogerioagjr), and advised by Prof. Pietro Perona and Prof. Markus Meister.

**2022/02/09** - I was elected as the Academic co-chair of the Neurotechers, club for graduate students in neuroscience at Caltech. Together with [Laura Luebbert](http://twitter.com/NeuroLuebbert), I will host the famous "fireside chats" (also called "Ask Me Anything") that invite faculty members in neuroscience to talk to graduate students at Caltech.
