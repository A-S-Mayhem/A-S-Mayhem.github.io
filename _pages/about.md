About me
======
I am currently a third year PhD studetn at [School of GeoSciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences), [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), working on climate modelling being co-funded by [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and [China Scholarship Council](https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-funding/postgraduate/international/region/asia/china-council). I recieved my BSc in [Ocenography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography)in 2010 and MSc in Satellite Ocean Remote Sensing in 2014 from [Ocean University of China](http://eweb.ouc.edu.cn/). You can find me from the [university page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/people/person.html?indv=5072), the [SAGES](http://www.sages.ac.uk/people/alcide-zhao/) website, [Research Gate]（https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alcide_Zhao） and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-H85oHsAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am interested in using observations and modles to imprrove our understanding of extreme climate events (e.g. Tropical Cyclones, heatwaves, extreme precipitaion et.) and therefore help better prediction of natural hazards.
