I am a lecturer in the [College of Information Science and Engineering](https://computer.haut.edu.cn), [Henan University of Techonology](https://www.haut.edu.cn). I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 2019 from [Center for Combinatorics](http://www.combinatorics.net.cn), [Nankai University](http://www.nankai.edu.cn).

My research interests include computer vision, machine learning and computational graphics, focusing specifically on image/video stitching, image manipulation, texture synthesis and image-to-image translation.

Here is my [CV](tlliao.github.io/files/cv_ltl.pdf) and <a href="#contact information">contact information</a>.
