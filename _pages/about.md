I am a senior Computer Science major and student researcher at Pomona College, currently applying to PhD programs in Computer Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning. I am interested in the security of machine learning systems and the use of machine learning – as well as other methods – towards approaching broader problems in the spaces of application, network, and systems security. Apart from this, I am also interested in genetic algorithms, privacy, and tech policy.

Since May 2021, I have worked for Pomona College's ARCS (Autonomous Robotics and Complex Systems) Lab, where I focus on researching and developing creative approaches to ease the pain of sim-to-real transfer in order to develop more safe, robust mobile robots. Through cybersecurity and software enginnering internships, I have also gained experience in building out ML-driven security solutions and mobile applications.

The overarching goal that I wish to pursue as a researcher is to develop solutions that make the technology used in daily life more secure and safe.

These days, I am working on two projects related to this goal. In the ARCS Lab, I am researching adversarial training and its potential benefits for the sim-to-real transferability of computer vision models. And, for my senior thesis, I am researching methods of protecting federated learning systems from post-breach evasion attacks.
