I am an undergraduate Math and CS double major at Georgia Tech graduating in the Spring of 2025. I'm concentrating in probability, statistics, A.I., and information interworks. I am particularly interested in deep learning and machine learning and their applications in many different fields such as CV, NLP, sustainable energy, robotics, etc.
