<b>About the lab</b>

The Flanagan Lab in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch is focused on understanding the evolution of complex, multivariate traits (especially sexually dimorphic traits), primarily relying on population and quantitative genetics, genomic datasets, simulation modeling. Our empirical work has mostly focused on pipefish and seahorses.


<b>Lab news</b>

March 2022: Fleur van Eyndhoven submitted her MSc thesis. Congratulations, Fleur!

Januray 2022: Coley Tosto, who began her PhD in November 2020, finally arrived in New Zealand to complete the remainder of her PhD!

Check out how Sarah spent her time in 2021 [in her latest blog post!](https://sarahpflanagan.wordpress.com/2022/01/04/working-in-the-age-of-lockdowns/)

December 2021: Sarah was awarded UC's Faculty of Science Emerging Researcher Award!

November 2021: Emily Beasley has joined the lab as a new PhD student, and we are also welcoming Jude van Houtte as a summer student! Starting in mid-November are two co-supervised students, Alexandra Cox (MSc) and Andrew McCabe (summer BSc student), who co-supervised by Sarah and [Claudia Meisrimler](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/claudia-meisrimler.html).

September 2021: Lucy Howell has started her PhD  in the lab!

March 2021: Lucy Howell's first paper from her masters research has been published in the New Zealand Journal of Zoology. It is a [review paper on using environmental DNA to monitor Antarctic vertebrates](https://doi-org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1080/03014223.2021.1900299).

March 2021: Sarah has published a paper on [the genetic basis of freshwater adaptation in pipefish](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/doi/10.1111/mec.15841). 

February 2021: Fleur van Eyndhoven is continuing her summer scholarship research on pipefish behaviour in her MSc research. She has already filmed >200 hours of pipefish behaviours!

November 2020: Nicole Tosto began her PhD studying pipefish behaviour and genetics! She is currently working with collaborators in the US and plans to join the group in New Zealand in 2021.

March 2020: Sarah had three papers come out this month -- a paper on [changes in gene expression in response to estrogen in pipefish](https://doi-org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1093/jhered/esaa008), a paper on [a mathematical model of how spatial arrangements of individuals impacts reproductive success](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1438-390X.12047) and a whitepaper describing [the why, when, and how of computing in biology classrooms](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20873.2).
