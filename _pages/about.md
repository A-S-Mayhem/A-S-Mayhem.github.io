I am PhD candidate at the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.illinois.edu), [University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign](http://illinois.edu)
My advisor is Prof. [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu), leading the [Text Information Management and Analysis Group (TIMAN)](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir).
My research interests are a mix of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing  and Information Retrieval.
I am excited about opportunities to work in areas such as *Reinforcement Learning*, *Game Theory* and *Meta-learning*.

My work is on all sorts of bottlenecks related to data noise, sparsity, domain shift and lack of annotations.
I mainly focus in on <span style="color:magenta">**Active and Semi-supervised learning**</span> and lately on <span style="color:magenta">**Domain Adaptation**</span>.
**Deep Learning for Social Media Analysis** is also another big part of my work. Social media text is informal, abundant and full of linguistic variations, a perfect example of noisy text.
I have also worked on interdisciplinary projects that touch societal problems. You can learn more by looking at my [publications](/publications) or the descriptions of current and past [projects](/projects).
