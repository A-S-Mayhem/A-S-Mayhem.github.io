I love how math can be used to improve the world. And as a person who believes in the power of education, I am happy to work in the intersection of education and statistics. I believe developing mathematical and statistical methods can improve the overall quality of education. This works by contributing to transforming seemingly abstract problems in the world into tractable ones. This drives valuable insights and even offers solutions for a wide array of educational issues. In a world with abundant educational data and technology, I believe my work can lead to globally impactful changes in educational and psychological research.

My primary area of research involves ways to improve the performance of latent variable methods when applied to large and unstructured data. I also study the use of artificial intelligence in psychometrics research.
 
I am also interested in studying the developmental process of mathematical cognition, curriculum and instructional designs to bridge the educational gap in math classrooms, and the facilitation of lifelong learning as a culture.
 
I received a B.S. in Mathematics Education from Ewha Womans University with certifications in teaching mathematics and in lifelong learning. I then earned a M.Ed. in Educational Measurement and Statistics from Korea University. My master's thesis, titled "Impact of Imposing Equality Constraints on Residual Variances Across Classes in Regression Mixture Models," was published in the Quantitative Psychology and Measurement section of Frontiers in Psychology. 

I worked as an admissions officer at universities in Korea, mainly working on data analysis to evaluate incoming students’ academic performance. I also provided data-driven support to aid the university administration’s decisions about admissions and future planning. I was also Research Executive for a short-term social research project that generated and analyzed data around involving a range of survey topics . I also taught middle school and high school mathematics in South Korea and the U.S. as a student teacher and lecturer.
