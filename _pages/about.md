Hi, I’m Blain. I’m a Ph.D. Student in Public Policy and Management at the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at The Ohio State University. My research interests are in economic resilience, energy policy, and sustainability. In broad terms, I research how businesses, communities, and systems operationalize resources during unexpected shocks. I am particularly interested in the sustainable and resilient management of environmental amenities, like public parks, in cities. I currently work as a data scientist in the Enterprise Analytics Office at Nationwide Insurance.

I was born in Hawaii, grew up in Massachusetts, and currently reside in Columbus, Ohio. I have an ScM in Biostatistics from Brown University and a BS in Economics from The Ohio State University. Outside the classroom, I enjoy cooking, fly fishing, playing golf and pickleball, and crossword puzzling.
