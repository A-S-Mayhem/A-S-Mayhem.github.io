I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Ocean Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology, specializing in hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling. 

My research focuses on using physics-based models to analyze watershed-scale hydrological processes during ice- or storm-induced flood events in the northeastern United States. This includes conducting simulations for streamflow and flood inundation mapping, with a specific emphasis on developing decision support tools to assist stakeholders. As part of my work, I integrate [a multi-satellite river ice product](https://web.stevens.edu/ismart/land_products/rivericemapping.html) into the modeling process by adjusting hydraulic properties. Additionally, I am exploring the implementation of machine learning-based surrogate or emulator models to improve computational efficiency and reduce the time required for hydrodynamic modeling, particularly for flood inundation mapping applications.
