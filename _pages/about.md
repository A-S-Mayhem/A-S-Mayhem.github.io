My name is Z. Sun, a final year PhD candidate at UCL. I am lucky to be supervised by Prof. [F-X Briol]() and Prof. [J-H Xue](). My research is mainly funded by EPSRC and UCL jointly; and partially by The Alan Turing Institute. Previously, I obtained a Master degree (Distinction) in Statistics at the University of Oxford.





## Research Interest
In general, I am very interested in __computational statistics__ and __machine learning__. I have been working on Stein's method, kernel methods, control variates and meta-learning. 


## Academic Activities
   * PhD researcher at The Alan Turing Institute 2021-2022.
   * Organiser of 2022 [Statistics in Data-Centric Engineering (S-DCE)]() Seminars at The Alan Turing Institute.
   * Reviewers: AISTATS, NeurIPS, UAI
