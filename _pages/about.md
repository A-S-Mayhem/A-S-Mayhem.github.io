I'm a third year mathematics PhD student in the Algorithms, Combinatorics, Optimization program at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm fortunate enough to be advised by [Dr. Anupam Gupta](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~anupamg/). I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am primarily interested in combinatorial optimization; I've recently been thinking about combinatorial problems in an online or stochastic setting.

I also enjoy mentoring and teaching. In the fall, I'll be a teaching assistant at my local high school math circle, [Euler Circle](https://eulercircle.com/) and last summer I was a graduate mentor in the [Polymath Jr Research Program](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu).

Outside of work, I am an avid foodie and I rock climb.
