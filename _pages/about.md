I am a project researcher (postdoc) at Kavli IPMU, University of Tokyo. I will be in the job market for the tenure track positions this year. Here is my [Resume](https://zy199402.github.io/files/CV.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nl4q45AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra). My email address is "yu.zhao _at_ ipmu.jp".

Research Interest
======
I am a geometric representation theorist, who aims to build a bridge between representation theory with algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and mathematical physics. Right now I am also working on the birational geometry of derived algebraic schemes/stacks. My research can be roughly divided into the following aspects:

1. geometric representation theory, especially the representation theory of Yangians, quantum groups, and cohomological Hall algebras.
2. derived algebraic geometry, especially the geometry of quasi-smooth and shifted symplectic stacks.
3. birational geometry, especially the vanishing theory for algebraic varieties.

Here are my research statements, with a [6-pages-version](https://zy199402.github.io/files/Short1.pdf) and a [12-pages-version](https://zy199402.github.io/files/Long-Research-Statement.pdf).
