Hello, I am **Natalí Soler Matubaro de Santi**, a theoretical physicist interested in cosmology, data science and machine learning. Currently, I am a PhD candidate of Institute of Physics at University of São Paulo, working with machine learning applied to cosmology. My advisor is Professor Raul Abramo (and he has a pretty nice [webpage](http://www.fma.if.usp.br/~abramo/Home.html), check out!).

Since I was a child I am fascinated by science, mostly Astronomy and Physics and computers (as you can see in the below pic).
