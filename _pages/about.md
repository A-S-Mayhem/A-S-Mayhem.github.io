I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Guoliang Fan](https://ceat.okstate.edu/ece/faculty/guoliang-fan.html) in the [School of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ceat.okstate.edu/ece/)of the Oklahoma State University (OSU). Before studying at OSU, I worked as a software testing engineer in China for seven years.I got my bachelor's degrees (2005-2009) from XI'AN Jiaotong University.

Research Interests
======
My research focus on advanced data analytics-based quality assurance for smart manufacturing from different perspectives, which invovles the general areal of machine learning, blockchain, and sensor fusion.

Data quality assurance: Propose a blockchain-enabled framework to prevent malicious cyber-physical attacks occuring on important data (stream data) and files (G-code).
Design quality assurance: Develop an autoencoder-based feature extraction method for smart machine parameter selection.
Process quality assurance: Incorporate LSTM-autoencoder, augmented time regularized genetative adversarial network (ATR-GAN), knowledge distillation (ongoing) to enhance the in-situ monitoring performance.
