I am currently a second year Electrical Engineering Doctorate Student at NYU Tandon. I recieved my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Santa Clara University in June 2022. My research interests focus on the intersection between Electromagnetics and Wireless Communications. The topic that I am researching right now is the use of positive feedback at receive channel of an antenna array in order to create an electromagnetic parallel to the frequency response of the mammalian cochlea. Previously, I have researched topics such as Direct Antenna Modulation, and the use of Software Defined Radios for Hydrogen Line Radio Astronomy.
