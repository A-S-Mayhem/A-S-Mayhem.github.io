I am a PhD student at CREST, under the supervision of [Vianney Perchet](https://vianney.ai/), since September 2020. My PhD title is "Online Matching in Random Graphs". I am interested in statistics and learning theory, and more specifically in online learning and algorithms. My current topics of research are Online Matching and Multi-Armed bandits.



Before that I got an engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique and graduated the master MVA (Machine Learning and Computer Vision) from ENS Paris-Saclay.

Between June and October 2022, I am an intern at DeepMind London in the Foundations team under the supervision of [Claire Vernade](https://www.cvernade.com/).
