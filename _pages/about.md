I am a second year Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology.

My research area is <a href="https://medium.com/@Kamel773/deep-learning-for-source-code-c1d652ab49fe">Deep Learning for Source Code</a>. More specifically, my research focus on finding algorithms that extract <em>less and higher quality data</em>, from extremely large dataset, to train deep leanring algorithms on source code for code understanding tasks. Training on <em>less, but better<em/> data achieve higher performance.
