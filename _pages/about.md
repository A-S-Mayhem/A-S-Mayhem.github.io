About Me
======
Hi, I'm Fang Gong. I recieved my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from China University of Geosciences (CUG-Wuhan) in Dec 2022, supervised by prof. [Liangxiao Jiang](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/jlx/zh_CN/). Currently, I'm a lecturer in School of Computer Science at Wuhan Institute of Technology. From Dec 2019 to Dec 2020, I visited at the Schulich School of Engineering Intelligent Geospatial Data Mining Lab in Department of Geomatics at University of Calgary, supervised by prof.[Xin Wang](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/xin-wang). 

Research Interest
======
Currently, I am broadly interested in data mining and machine learning.

In particular, the goal is to develop machine learning-based algorithms for categorical data analysis, e.g., distance metric and representation learning. The difficulties in categorical data analysis is, but not limited to, how to represent the complex coupling relationships, how to handle the concept shift, and how to handle the imbalance data, which bring in the consiferable challanges. We wish to develop the effective and efficient methods about structure extension, multi-view learning, dynamic ensemble learning, few-shot learning to tackle these challenges.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
