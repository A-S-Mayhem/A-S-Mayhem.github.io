I am a sixth-year MD-PhD student in Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology under the direction of Neil Sarkar at the Center for Biomedical Informatics at Brown University. My research interests focus on the development of informatics methods that leverage population-level data to improve the accuracy of cardiovascular disease risk estimation towards a learning healthcare system. My work aims to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines, enhance the precision of preventative medical therapies, better explain observed health outcome disparities in racial and ethnic minority populations, and develop mechanisms for translating omics research into clinical medical practice. I received an Sc.B. from Brown University in Applied Mathematics.

Before returning to Brown, I spent two years as part of the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital working to understand cardiovascular pathophysiology including heart failure using exercise as a physiologic probe. As part of that research team, among other projects, we demonstrated that increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure relative to cardiac output during exercise predicts exercise capacity and heart failure outcomes.
