I am interested in understanding complex multi-agent behavior and imbuing robots with agility and intelligence. I tackle these problems using techniques from control theory, machine learning, optimization, and biology. I am also a zoologist. I aim to draw computational tools from robotics and AI to study animal behavior. Currently, I am studying in the movement ecology of large marine predators.
