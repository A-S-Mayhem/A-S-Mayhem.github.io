Hi, I’m Blain. I’m Ph.D. Student in Public Policy and Management at the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at The Ohio State University. My research interests are in economic resilience, environmental policy, and energy policy. In broad terms, I research how businesses and communities operationalize their resources during unexpected shocks. I am particularly interested in the sustainable and resilient management of environmental amenities, like public parks, in cities. Currently, I work as the statistical programmer for the [Business Resilience Calculator](resiliencecalculator.com).

 I was born in Hawaii, grew up in Massachusetts, and currently reside in Columbus, Ohio. I have an ScM in Biostatistics from Brown University and a BS in Economics from The Ohio State University. Outside the classroom, I like to fish, play disc golf, ride motorcycles, cook, travel, and quibble about minutiae.
