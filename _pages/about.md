Iâ€™m a fourth year PhD candidate in the [Statistics Department](https://statistics.berkeley.edu) and a Fellow at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](http://bids.berkeley.edu). My advisor is [Philip Stark](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/). In 2014 I received my B.A. in Statistics and B.A. in Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley. My research interests include nonparametric statistics, causal inference, reproducibility, and applications in the health and social sciences.

Outside of statistics, I am passionate about food and fitness.
