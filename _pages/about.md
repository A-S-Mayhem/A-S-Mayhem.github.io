Im Professor Pleno (equivalent to Full Professor) of Mathematics at the Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia. My research topics are Numerical Analysis of Finite Element Methods, Computational Modelling and Continuous Optmization. Precisely, I have been interested in the study of Mixed Stabilized formulations for nonlinear elliptic equations, mathematical modelling of the pseudoplastic behaviour of the blood flow and optimization methods on Riemannian manifolds.
