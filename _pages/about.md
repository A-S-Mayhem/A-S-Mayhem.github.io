My name is Hadi Mohaghegh Dolatabadi (just call me Hadi! :D). Currently, I am a second year Ph.D. student at the University of Melbourne, working under the supervision of [Dr. Sarah Erfani](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/smonazam/) and [Prof. Christopher Leckie](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/people/staff.php?person_ID=6335). My main research interests are generative modeling and adversarial machine learning. Throughout the past year, I have been closely working on normalizing flows and their applications. Always happy to discuss research-related topics. 

__Research Interests__

* Normalizing Flows
* Generative Modeling
* Adversarial Robustness
* Machine Learning
* Signal Processing
