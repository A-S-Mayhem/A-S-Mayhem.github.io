I am an undergraduate student of Economics at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, with a special interest in development economics, applied microeconomics and in carrying out economic studies on social programs focused on vulnerable populations. I am currently working as a pre-professional microfinance analysis intern at ([Superintendency of Banking, Insurance and Private Pension Fund Administrators (SBS)](https://www.sbs.gob.pe/)) and as a volunteer in the area of research and publications of ([Economica](https://economica.pe/)).

Volunteering
======
Together with a group of colleagues, we ran as the board of directors of the ([PUCP economics student assembly](https://instagram.com/aee.pucp?igshid=NWRhNmQxMjQ=)) during the 2021-2 academic period. During this experience I served as director of the marketing area and was in charge of leading a group of economics students from PUCP, so that they can demonstrate their academic work in social networks.

I was also a volunteer in the area of art and image in the ([Economica](https://economica.pe/)) student organization for approximately one year. In this area I was in charge of collecting and preparing informative reports on the main media, specifically those specialized in economics. I am currently a member of the area of research and publications, in which I make weekly presentations on economic issues.
