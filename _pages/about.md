I am a Postdoctoral researcher at MBZUAI working with Dr. [Shangsong Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4uggVcIAAAAJ). Our team, led by Dr Liang works closely with Prof. [Eilam Gross](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iibZFkYAAAAJ) from Weizmann Institute of Science on a **Particle Physics** project, where we aim to apply deep neural networks to predict new particles. In addition, I work with Dr. [Zaiqiao Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5jJKFVcAAAAJ&hl=en) and we lead the **BioKR2** (Bio knowledge Representation and Reasoning) Lab. The ultimate goal of **BioKR2** is to inspire the bioinformatics reseach by using meaningful representation learning methods. 

I used to be a member of [Terrier team](http://terrierteam.dcs.gla.ac.uk/index.html), supervised by Prof. [Iadh Ounis](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/) and Prof. [Craig Macdonald](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/craigmacdonald/#). I am researching in the field of **Graph Representaion Learning**, **Recommender Systems** and **Natural Language Processing**. Besides, I have a strong passion for topics like **Fintech** (NLP for finance) and **Bioinformatics** (protein-drug relationships).  

I am one of the cofounders and main contributors of the Beta-Recsys project, an open source project for Building, Evaluating and Tuning Automated Recommender Systems ([Link](https://beta-recsys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
