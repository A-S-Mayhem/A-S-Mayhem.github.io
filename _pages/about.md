I work at the intersection of civil engineering, climate resilience, and data and network science.

My research delves into the complexities of spatiotemporal transportation resilience under climate change. It highlights network-level features of transportation systems, such as trip-level risk accumulation, cascading failures, and potential tipping points that lead to system-wide collapse.

Beyond theoretical contributions, I also emphasize the practical application of my research through the development of simulation software tools like [SidewalkSim](https://github.com/gti-gatech/SidewalkSim) and [TransitSim](https://github.com/gti-gatech/TransitSim4). My research has been published in high-impact journals, such as Sustainable Cities and Society, and has earned me competitive grants and fellowships, totaling over $200,000.

Outside of my research, I’ve had the privilege of serving in various leadership roles at the Women’s Transportation Seminar’s Student Chapter at Georgia Tech.

As an educator, I serve as co-instructor and instructor of record for three courses, integrating my interdisciplinary research background into the classroom, highlighting an inclusive learning environment. My academic trajectory underscores my commitment to enhancing transportation network resilience and equity.
