Welcome to the website for the Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network (BVCN). Many research laboratories are currently shutting down due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. This leaves acadmics at all levels in a difficult position - where research in the lab [may not resume for many months](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR2vwiQNBs_lisviJG3d2VAl-etCEuVsMCGEV09YEilvrwTL1Zwv0Qd34Dg). We are a group of bioinformaticians and computational biologists committed to helping wet-lab biologists pick up some computational skills/begin computational projects during this global crisis.
