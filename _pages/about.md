I was born in Zaragoza (Spain), where I also obtained my Computer Science Engineering degree. Later I moved to Madrid to study my Master's degree in Computer Graphics, Videogames and Virtual Reality. Now I work as a research engineer at Desilico Labs S.L.

I really enjoy playing videogames, reading books and watching movies. Also I like to work on projects related to render, offline and real-time, but specially physically based offline render projects.
