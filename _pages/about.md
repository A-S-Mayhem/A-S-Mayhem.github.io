Hello and welcome! I am a 6th year PhD candidate in Molecular and Cell Biology at Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, MD. I am under the advisorship of Dr. Rachel Cox, and my work aims to elucidate the function and composition of the mitochondria-associated,ribonucleoprotein <b>Clueless</b> as well as its potential role in mitochondrial function and translation of mitochondrial proteins in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. My anticipated graduation date is December 2021 - January 2022. This space is a work in progress; however, feel free to visit my publications in the meantime to learn more about my thesis work!
