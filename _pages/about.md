I'm a philosopher and cognitive scientist engaged in both theoretical and experimental research in embodied cognitive science. The primary focus of my research is on the implications of embodiment for how we make sense of "higher cognition" and technologically-supported problem solving, including in scientific practice. My main influences are the scientific traditions of Gibsonian ecological psychology and dynamical systems theory, and the philosophical traditions of pragmatism and phenomenology. 




About me
======

Since May 2020 I've been a postdoctoral researcher at Technische Universität Berlin, where I founded and lead the [EMBODY Research Group](https://embody-rg.github.io/) (**E**xploring **M**ind and **B**ehavior in **O**rganism-environment **DY**namics). My faculty mentors and collaborators are Miriam Kyselo (Philosophy @ NTNU) and Klaus Gramann (Biological Psychology and Neuroergonomics @ TU Berlin).

Previously, in 2019 I received my PhD in philosophy from the University of Cincinnati (working with Angela Potochnik). There I also received graduate training in experimental psychology at the Center for Cognition, Action, & Perception (working with Paula Silva and Tony Chemero). Before Cincinnati I earned a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in philosophy from the University of São Paulo (Brazil), where I'm from, and I was a visiting master's student for two semesters at the Georgia Institute of Technology (working with Nancy Nersessian) and for one semester at Georgia State University. 

For 6 years my wife and I had a backyard farm in Cincinnati, with miniature dairy goats, rabbits, chickens, and a vegetable garden. Our new big project is to raise a human being. Thankfully, when we moved to Berlin we ended up moving one block away from a public park that has goats and chickens, so we get to enjoy big city life without missing too much our backyard farming days.
