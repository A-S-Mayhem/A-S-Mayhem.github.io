My reseacrh interest is in the complex processes that connects rocks, water and life. I enjoy working in interdisciplinary science research and education aspects. My deep interest lies in integrating geoscience, mineralogy, biogeochemistry, and geomirobiology with climate and environmental polution that impacts water quality, water sequrity and food security. As a geoscientist, scientific tools that fascinate most include  geo-thermochronometric dating, luminescence dating, geomorphometric analysis, and reactive transport modeling in porous medium. These tools can provide information about erosion and weathering patterns, regolith formation, and biogeochemical cycling from sediment, rock, and soil. Integrating these measurements can help in understanding the connection between life and landscape and making progress in understanding how natural processes and humans shape Earth's surface.
