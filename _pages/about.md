Hello, my name is Marcus Torres and I am a PhD Student in Political Science at the [Universidade Federal de Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/politica). Also, I am [BITTS Catalyst](https://www.bitss.org/people/marcus-torres/). My research interests are bureaucracy, non state actors, social results determinants and public resource allocation.

My PhD project is about the impact of Political Dynasties in social policy outcomes in Brazil. 

Prior, I focused my reasearch on health policy results determinants in Brazil. More especifically, in my thseis I worked with Voluntary federal transferences to Non State Actors in health local policies. To do that, I managed multiple large datasets to create a one of a kind database.   

If you feel interested about my research, here is my [CV](files/cv.pdf) ou my [Lattes](http://goo.gl/fFVKNZ) (in Portuguese).
