CFCS, Computer Science Department, Peking University, Beijing, China.

I am currently a fifth-year PhD student at Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). I am expected to obtain my doctoral degree in July next year. I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree from the Department of Computer Science at Peking University.

My current research focuses on blockchain, specifically addressing game-theoretic design and solving security problems in distributed systems. I am dedicated to analyzing the economic security of existing blockchain protocols using techniques such as game theory, algorithm analysis, and reinforcement learning, while also employing mechanism design and applied cryptography to develop new protocols.

For example, I am now particularly interested in analyzing and addressing issues such as selfish mining in Ethereum, the MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) problem, and the design of transaction fee mechanisms.

During my Ph.D. studies, I was a visiting researcher in Prof. [Bin Xiao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csbxiao/)'s group at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University from January 2023 to May 2023.
