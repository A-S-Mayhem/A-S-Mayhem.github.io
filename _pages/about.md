About me
======

I'm a Ph.D. student in [Leeds School of Business at University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/business/). I'm honored to be advised by [Prof. Huanan Zhang](http://huananzhang.mystrikingly.com/). My current research interest lies in online learning algorithms, especially their application in supply chain management. I received my M.S. in [Industrial Engineering & Operations Research at The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.ime.psu.edu/) in 2020 and B.S. in [Mathematics at University of Science and Technology of China](http://math.ustc.edu.cn/ENGLISH/list.htm) in 2017.
