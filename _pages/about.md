I am a third year PhD candidate in [biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at Harvard University. [My research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iZnTmxMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) focuses on developing new statistical methods to leverage real world data to improve decision-making in public health and clinical medicine. Specifically, my academic interests include robust and efficient estimation and inference using large-scale data generated from electronic health records and clinical trial data. I'm lucky to be mentored by [Professor Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/).

My current research goals include developing:
* Robust estimators for validating surrogate markers in observational data. 
* Semi-supervised transfer learning algorithms to improve pragmatic trial efficiency when the study endpoint is time-to-event, captured using imperfect surrogates in electronic health records.
* Communication-efficient, distributed learning algorithms that robustly estimate treatment effects in target populations under privacy constraints and site-heterogeneity.
* Principled approach for sensitivity analysis of design parameters in evaluating competing clinical trial designs.

I enjoy playing golf, rooting for my alma mater (UNC Tar Heels!), reading history, and staying up-to-date with global affairs.
