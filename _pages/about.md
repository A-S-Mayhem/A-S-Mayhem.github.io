I work as an economist at the [Institut des politiques publiques](https://www.ipp.eu/), a research center in public policy evaluation. I work on the French tax and benefit system, on French labor market issues, and on environmental problems. Prior to this, I have worked a little in development economics, mostly on [Chinese politics]() and [South African pensions]().

I like to play Scrabble, run and climb in forests, sail on the sea, and read history books.
