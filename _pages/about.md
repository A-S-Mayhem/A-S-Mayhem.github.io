I'm Hannah-Marie Martiny and currently I am pursuing a Master of Science in Bioinformatics Systems Biology at the Technical University of Denmark. At this time of writing, I have started on my thesis, where I am working with predicting recombinant gene expression by applying deep learning techniques. 

Feel free to reach out to me, if you have any inquries!
