After the National College Entrance Examination (a.k.a, Gaokao), I chose an unique destination (i.e., Taipei) for further education. At present, I am a final-year undergradute in National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Academicly, I am good at mathematics (i.e., mostly A+), while poor at electronic (i.e., avergely C). On reflection, I find the general truth of my study---the work won't be hard if I am interested in it (i.e., there is a will, there is a way), while I will not work hard if I am not interested (i.e., hard to keep motivated if not out of interest). Right now, I am intereted in doing research like a scientist, and ready to get my hand dirty as an engineer.
