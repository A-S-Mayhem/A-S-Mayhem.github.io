I am currently a Byrne Research Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan.  I completed my DPhil in Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Professor Rama Cont. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Chennai Mathematical Institute, India in 2016 and Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from Chennai Mathematical Institute, India in 2018. 


Research interests: 
------
My research interests lie in the fields of stochastic analysis and its applications to mathematical finance. In particular:

Pathwise methods in stochastic analysis: Föllmer-Itô calculus,  'roughness' of functions.

Roughness in finance: Rough volatility, Microstructure noise.
