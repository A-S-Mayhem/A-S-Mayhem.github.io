Hi! I am currently a staff engineer in the Search Ads team at Baidu Inc., working on developing large language models. Prior to joining Baidu, I was an algorithm expert in the Ad Tech team at Alibaba Group (AliStar, 2021). I received my Ph.D. degree in June 2021 from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and my B.Eng. degree in June 2016 from Wuhan University (WHU).  


Research Interests
======
My research interests are in **computational advertising** and **large language models**, and broader interests include reinforcement learning, federated learning, graph neural networks and their applications in advertising, search and recommendation.   

During my Ph.D., my research interests were in natural language processing and computational social science, especially *opinion mining* and *opinionated/argumentative text generation* in low-resource scenarios (e.g., cross-domain transfer, learning with noisy labels and sequence generation with few paired data).
