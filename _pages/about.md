I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, studying Human-Computer Interaction with Profs. [Brian Bailey](http://orchid.cs.illinois.edu/people/bailey/index.html) and [Karrie Karahalios](http://social.cs.uiuc.edu/people/karriekarahalios.html). My research interests include team formation, STEM education, algorithm awareness, and crowdsourcing. I am also a Graduate Measurement Science and Engineering Fellow with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, working with [Michael Brundage](https://www.nist.gov/people/michael-p-brundage), [Thurston Sexton](https://www.nist.gov/people/thurston-sexton), and the [Knowledge Extraction Application team] (https://www.researchgate.net/project/Knowledge-Extraction-and-Application-for-Smart-Manufacturing) in NIST's Engineering Laboratory.

I previously earned my B.A. summa cum laude from Knox College in Galesburg, IL with a major in Computer Science and a self-designed minor in Renaissance and Medieval Studies. I have always been interested in both fields, and in addition to my current research, I am particularly excited about projects that combine the two areas.

When not studying or working at school, I also run a small craft business, [Realms of Legend] (realmsoflegend.etsy.com), for which I create handmade items inspired by fantasy and sci-fi series that I love, as well as past eras of our own world.
