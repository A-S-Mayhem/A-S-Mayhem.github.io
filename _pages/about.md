I am a Research Intern in [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io)'s Group in Westlake University currently. Previously, I was a CS Master in The University of Edinburgh, and my master thesis is supervised by Prof. [Frank Keller](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/). Before that, I recieved Bachelor degree in Nanjing University of Science and Technology, major in Control & Measurement. My research interest is NLP, especially Multi-Modal learning and Data-to-text generation.



My Research & Project Experience
======
Multi-Modal Cross-lingual Transfer Learning
------
Currently, I am focusing on how to implement meta-learning method in the scenario of multi-modal cross-lingual transfer, trying to improve current multilingual V&L pretrained models' ability of generalization across languages. 

This is my master thesis, and I am supervised by Prof. [Frank Keller](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/)

Improving Robustness of Controllable data-to-text generation
------
This is the final course work of my course Machine Learning Practical in The University of Edinburgh. We won the third place IBM Prize (for the best project of this course)



A Channel Mix Method For Fine-Grained Cross-Modal Retrieval
------
A project about cross-modal retrieval I participated during my bachelor period, it has been accepted by ICME.
