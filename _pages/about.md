## About
<!-- ====== -->

Masashi Sode is a AI engineer/data scientist and is engaged in research and development of AI for medical applications.

As a key developer and researcher on the AI team at Aillis, Inc.(startup company), He led the AI team from prototyping to commercialization of influenza diagnosing AI. Through working closely with physicians, hardware team, and software/AI team as a collaborative research project, the project was successfully completed from prototyping to clinical trial in a short period.

Before joining Aillis, Inc., He was doing research in the aerospace field at Tohoku University. He conducted the research on multi-objective Bayesian optimization for composite aircraft design. To create the automated aircraft design method, the Genetic Algorithm, multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian process, Finite Element Method, Computational Fluid Dynamics, and the fluid-structure interaction method are integrated into a Python library with a high-performance computation environment.
