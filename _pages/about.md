I am a Senior Economist in the Research Department of the [Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/). My research interests span urban, environmental, and development economics. I completed my PhD in 2017 at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was advised by faculty in both the [Department of Economics](https://econ.ucsb.edu/) and the [Bren School](https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/).

Before graduate school, I worked for an energy efficiency consulting firm in Austin, TX. During my undergraduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin, where I majored in Latin American Studies ([LLILAS](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/llilas/)) and Economics, I produced documentaries about social issues in Thailand and Paraguay. Once upon a time, I spent two years at UNT in Denton, TX, thinking I wanted to study music. Before that, I delivered pizza and gassed up boats.
