Research
======
The starting point of our research is the research environment in the Czech Republic. We aim to identify problems, find the data accurately describing it and analyze it.

My largest contribution in the process is the passion about data processing. I do everything from scraping the data from the internet to interactive visualizations in Javascript and [D3](https://d3js.org/).
