I am a 21 years old student soon to graduate with a Bachelor in Economics and Computer Science. I decided to do this experiment since I like coding and found an easy template to develop a simple page. In the future, I would like to conduct some academic research and earn a doctorate degree, so I hope I will be able to fill this website with talks, publications etc. Feel free to explore its primordial form and make any suggestion! On the left, some contact information is made available. On the top menu, each visitor is allowed to access my Resume, my portfolio, and a blog I might start using. 
Next steps in my career will be earning my Masters' degree in Data Science and a doctorate. In the long term, I would love to apply the knowledge I am acquiring in what I call a _human setting_ dealing with people's problems such as health, environment, national security. Nevertheless, no one knows what life brings us, and I like to explore different fields, talk to people, get to experience whatever attracts me. 


A little bit about me, things that are not in my CV
======
Born and raised in the Milan metropolitan area, in a small town with a big identity. Atteded a Scientific oriented high school in Milan, to later move to one of the most prestigious (if not the most prestigious) Economics Universities in Italy. In the free time, I enjoy deepening my understanding of what I am studying, spending valuable time alone, seeing friends, cycling, drinking coffee, doing sports, listening to the radio or expanding my music collection. I like to keep myself busy and at the same time find moments of the day in which I kill time, just to keep a balance between activities. 

Purpose of this website
======
There are many reasons why someone should open a website. First of all, it is a great way to have fun while developing it. Secondly, the uses are plentiful. It is in many ways a modern business card, widely used in an academic setting, to collect all that one does, and even something more. The cool thing, which sets it apart form LinkedIn, is that there is more freedom of choice of contents and layout. I had to keep it simple since I am not very knowledgeable of web programming, but with more experience a lot of things can be done better. In addition to that, I really like the idea of keeping a blog, not necessarily so that other can read it, but rather to keep track of thoughts and opinions about things that happen to me or in the world. Maybe, in some years I will look back to these and have a different perspective. 

Contact Information
======
On the left side of the pages there should be many platforms in which I can be contacted. Feel free to write me via email, LinkedIn, Twitter, or whatever you find! I am open to discuss anything you propose. Thank you for passing by!


How to do this, Credits to the creator
------
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
