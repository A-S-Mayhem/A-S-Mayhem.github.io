Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Yuri and I am a PhD candidate in Decision, Risk and Operations at Columbia University, where I have the pleasure to be advised by Professor [Omar Besbes](http://www.columbia.edu/~ob2105/bio.html) and Professor [Ilan Lobel](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~ilobel/) from NYU-Stern. I am interested in online optimization, decision-making, and learning in complex environments such as online platform and marketplaces. I am also passioned about entrepreneurship and machine learning applied in operations.
