I'm a second year undergraduate student from [Zhi Class](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/rcpy/zbpy/zbjj.htm), [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes machine learning, and computer vision.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io/) from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I was advised by [Prof. Di He](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/) from [School of Intelligence Science and Technology](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

I am currently interested in how Large models extract knowlegde and why Transformers are so powerful.
