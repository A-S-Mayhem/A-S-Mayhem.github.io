**Mini Bio**: I am a Lecturer in Spacecraft Engineering at Queen Mary University of London in the UK. Previously, I was fortunate to be a visiting researcher at the DARTS Lab working under Dr. Abhi Jain at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I then also worked at the Surrey Space Centre based within the the University of Surrey, Guildford- again in the UK. It is these experiences that got me into the field of space robotics despite, building upon a fundamental engineering science-based PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California, Davis.

The *Tufte-Jekyll* theme is a natural extension of the work done by [Edward Tufte](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and his collaborators on Github who created a CSS file that allows web writers to use the same simple and elegant style employed in his published materials.

To incorporate these styles into a Jekyll theme, I have made some very slight modifications that attempt to maintain the feel of the CSS styles in his Github repo.

Note that this is a full-width layout. This was accomplished by including ```layout: full-width``` in the YAML front matter for this page. Keep in mind that all the Tufte-Jekyll sidenote and marginnote goodness will not work on full-width layouts! 

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
