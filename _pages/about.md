Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at HKUST Business School. Please see my [CV.pdf](https://zhenghua-qi.github.io/files/CV_AUG30.pdf) (August 2022) here. I am currently visiting the University of California, Berkeley during the 23-24 academic year. 

My research interests are in macroeconomics and expectation formation. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Finance from Shandong University and my master's degree in Finance and Economics with distinction from the London School of Economics and Political Science.
