I am an **[Old Dominion University](https://odu.edu/) graduate student** pursuing an **M.S. in Computer Science**, where I expect to graduate by Spring 2025.

Technology, understanding different cultures, and continual learning have always been central to my life.  I thrive on the excitement of generating creative and innovative solutions within a collaborative setting while continually learning from others and my own experiences.

I am a community organizer for two local Southwest Florida Meetup groups:
* [Python SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/pythonswfl/)
  - Expanding the knowledge of Python
  - Comprised of over 350 members.
* [Tech Alliance of SWFL](https://www.meetup.com/techallianceswfl/)
  - The umbrella organization for seven tech groups in Southwest Florida.
  - Comprised of over 700 members.
  - We are a collective of technology groups and industry leaders dedicated to fostering innovation, promoting technology education, and driving the growth of technology in the Southwest Florida region.

I am passionate about technology, communication, travel, concerts, and mastering Spanish.
