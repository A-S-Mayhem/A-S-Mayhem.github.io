I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Health Sciences](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/health-sciences/) at Northeastern University. I am also an Impact Engine Fellow of the [Real-World Healthcare Navigator Impact Engine](https://impactengines.northeastern.edu/ie/rwhn/). 

I obtained my PhD in [Biostatistics at Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) in May 2023, advised by [Professor Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/tianxi-cai/) and [Professor Lorenzo Trippa](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/lorenzo-trippa/). I completed a postdoctoral fellowship, advised by [Professor Sharon-Lise Normand](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/people/sharon-lise-normand), from May to Aug 2023 in the [Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School](https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/about). I received an AM in Biostatistics from Harvard in 2020, an MPhil in Healthcare Operations from the University of Cambridge in 2018, an MA in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University in 2017, and a BS in Public Health and Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2016.

[My research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iZnTmxMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) focuses on developing novel statistical methods to leverage real-world data to improve decision-making in public health and clinical medicine, including robust and efficient estimation and inference of treatment effects using large-scale data generated from electronic health records and clinical trial data. Active areas of research include causal inference, conformal inference, data integration, federated and transfer learning, and sensitivity analysis.

I enjoy playing golf (especially in my home state of North Carolina), reading history (especially biographies), and staying up-to-date with global affairs (especially US-China relations). Feel free to reach out via email: [lar.han@northeastern.edu](lar.han@northeastern.edu).
