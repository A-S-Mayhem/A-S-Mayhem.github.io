I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/de">Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics</a> (MPA) in Garching supervised by <a href="https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~komatsu/">Eiichiro Komatsu</a>.

I am interested in the physics of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and in the development of simulations for the next-generation CMB experiments, LiteBIRD in particular.
My research so far focused on how half-wave plate (HWP) systematics can impact the science that can be extracted from CMB polarization.
