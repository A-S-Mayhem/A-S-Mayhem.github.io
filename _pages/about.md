Hello and welcome, my name is Zhichuan MA, currently a second year's graduate student of [Ecole Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.polytechnique.edu/). I did my bachelor in [Zhejiang University](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj-m5me976BAxU-TKQEHYgQBIUQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zju.edu.cn%2Fenglish%2F&usg=AOvVaw3Z42KzM3Yu8rBgysZ5oIcc&opi=89978449) and was admitted by [Chu Kochen Honors College](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjTxtW5976BAxXuaqQEHd_BBF8QFnoECA0QAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fckc.zju.edu.cn%2Fckcen%2F&usg=AOvVaw2HxmqUme8Ct7aGOl2n-Xyv&opi=89978449) after national college entrance examinations of China in 2019. I have spent past 4 years delving deep into the energy engineering and their interactions with other subjects. Additionally, due to the diversified training programs in Zhejiang University and Ecole Polytechnique, I was able to be equipped with fundamental knowledge regarding mathematics & physics as well as advanced computer skills.
