My name is Ethan Landers, and I am a senior computer science undergraduate student at Old Dominion University.  I am enrolled in the ODU Computer Science Linked Program where I can take four master's courses while in my senior year of undergraduate studies.  I am also a part of the ODU Perry Honors College.
