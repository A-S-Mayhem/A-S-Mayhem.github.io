I am currently a third year PhD student at [School of GeoSciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences), [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), working on climate modelling being co-funded by [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and [China Scholarship Council](https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-funding/postgraduate/international/region/asia/china-council). I recieved my BSc in [Ocenography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography) in 2010 and MSc in Satellite Ocean Remote Sensing in 2014 from [Ocean University of China](http://eweb.ouc.edu.cn/). You can also find me from the [university page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/people/person.html?indv=5072), the [SAGES](http://www.sages.ac.uk/people/alcide-zhao/) website, [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alcide_Zhao) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-H85oHsAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am interested in using satellite observations, reanalysis data and earth system modles to imprrove our understanding of extreme climate events (e.g. Tropical Cyclones, heatwaves, extreme precipitaion et.) and therefore help better prediction of natural hazards.
