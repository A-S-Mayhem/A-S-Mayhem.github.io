I began my academic life at the University of Malaga where I studied Biomedical Engineering, specialized in bioelectronics. I built up a strong background on physiology, anatomy, electromagnetic compatibility for medical devices, analogue and digital electronics and mechanical design. During my bachelor, I held an international scholarship program to study at Incheon National University at South Korea where I developed my skills in brain engineering, nanodevice engineering and quantum analysis for nanoscience and nanoscale analysis. 

In January 2020 I graduated the University of Glasgow with a first-class masterâ€™s degree in Mechatronics, having completed a thesis on the design of a brain bioimplantable device as a collaboration with the Microelectronics Laboratory (MeLAB) with Dr Hadi Heidari as head of the group. The implantable device was designed as part of the Hybrid Enhanced Regenerative Medicine Systems (HERMES) project. The key goal of this project is the treatment of brain diseases and more specifically, epilepsy. 

I began my PhD in September 2020 at the National Centre of Microelectronics of Seville, in Spain, as part of The Group of Neuromorphic Systems, under the supervision of Dr Teresa Serrano-Gotarredona. My project falls under the research of algorithms, circuits and adaptative systems to be integrated on biological tissue and detection, analysis and pattern detection of epilepsy seizures.
