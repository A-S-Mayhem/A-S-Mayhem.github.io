I am a SENSE CDT PhD student in the School of Geosciences. My project focuses on using remote sensing to investigate the influence of meltwater and subglacial hydrology on the dynamics of Greenlandâ€™s marine-terminating glaciers.  My primary supervisor is Professor Peter Nienow, I am also co-supervised by Dr Anna Hogg, Dr Encarni Medina-Lopez, Dr Andrew Sole and Dr Benjamin Davidson.
