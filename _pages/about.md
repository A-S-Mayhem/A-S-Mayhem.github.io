Welcome! I am a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the Web and Internet Science in the School of Electronics and Computer Science, Southampton University, UK. 


I have obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Tartu University, where my research focused on deciding the optimal configurations of Big Data platforms while processing large Knowledge Graphs (KGs). My work resulted in several peer-to-peer reviewed publications in several prominent journals and conferences in the area of knowledge management, such as the SWJ, ISWC, CACM, DOLAP, and IEEE Big Data. I also got the best Ph.D. symposium paper award at the 26th ADBIS conference in Torino, Italy.

My research interests include Semantic Web, Large Knowledge Graphs processing, and BD analytics. My recent research interests focus on decentralized web search and information retrieval.

I also participated in several teaching activities including Data Engineering, Big Data Management, and  (Advanced) Databases.  

For my career, I aim to continue my pursuit of impactful research and collaboration. I seek opportunities to apply my expertise in Web and Big Data to address pressing challenges in various domains, further advancing the field and making a positive impact on society.



<!-- During my work at Southampton University, I joined the ESPRESSO research project that aims at enabling efficient search over personal data stores, ensuring privacy and user sovereignty. In this project, I have led the investigation and development of various query routing and propagation techniques for optimizing decentralized search over large-scale distributed personal data stores. He also led the design and development of several decentralized algorithms for ranking search results aggregated from various decentralized data sources. -->

<!-- In addition, Dr. Mohamed Ragab contributed to envisioning the end-to-end architecture that empowers decentralized search on the web personal data stores. He also contributed to the test and implementation of several benchmarking experiments, comparing the performance of the decentralized search functionalities to the baseline centralized search. The result of his leadings and contributions to the ESPRESSO project have been successfully published in top-tier conferences and journals, such as VLDB, ISWC, WSDM, WEBCONF, and EDBT.  -->


<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->
