Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the Intelligent Automation Research Group at RMIT University, Australia, advised by Prof. Alireza Bab-Hadiashar, Prof. Reza Hoseinnezhad and Dr Ruwan Tennakoon. 

My PhD research focuses on the topic of machine learning (deep learning) and computer vision (stereo depth sensing) for autonomous robotic applications. In addition, I also have experience in the following topics/frameworks: 
* (ML) representation learning, domain adaptation and generalisation, Bayesian deep learning, information theory, generative modelling, and adversarial learning; 
* (CV) stereo matching, semantic/panoptic segmentation, optical flow, image classification, object detection and localisation, and image synthesis;
* PyTorch, TensorFlow, Python, Jupyter, Git.

I am also currently working as a tutor and lab demonstrator for the COSC2673 Machine Learning course at RMIT University, since February 2021. Formerly, I have also worked as a lab demonstrator and teaching assistant for two other courses: Digital Fundamental and Introduction to Mechatronics. 

Previously, I have also worked in other areas such as 
* simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) as my final year project for my bachelor's degree; 
* robot manipulator design for adaptive object gripping; 
* parachute and recovery system design for model rockets; 
* sensor fusion using multiple RGB-D (Microsoft Kinects) cameras and an infrared camera for an industry project.

I am truly passionate about acquiring new knowledge and delivering novel solutions developed from theoretical research to solve practical industrial problems. I also very much enjoy teaching, doing research, and drinking coffee.
