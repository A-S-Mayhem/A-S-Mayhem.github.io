Welcome! I’m **Wei Wu**, an applied researcher and tech lead who designs, trains, and deploys *large-language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems,* and *reinforcement-learning pipelines* at **TikTok AI Search**.  
My research interests mainly reside in:
- **Scale multilingual LLMs** to billions of users  
- **Align models** with RLHF & reward modeling for safe, useful AI  
- **Fuse search & generative AI** to deliver fluent, factual answers

## ✨ What I Do

| Focus Area | Highlights |
|------------|------------|
| **LLM Pre-training & Alignment** | • Model architecture design to boost QPS and context length<br>• RLHF + knowledge distillation outperforming all 7B baselines |
| **Search & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | • End-to-end summary generation system for TikTok Search<br>• Multilingual Search BERT deployed across TikTok Search markets |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | • Process-reward models for reasoning tasks<br>• Developed reward merging strategies to mitigate reward hacking. |
| **Applied ML Engineering** | • Visual search ranking for Douyin<br>• Funnel-Transformer for long-doc QA |
