Hi! I am a third-year doctoral student in [School of Information](https://ischool.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I have a background in data and learning sciences. My research interests are primarily focused on human-centered computing and critical data studies. I am currently studying social, cultural, and political components of data-informed processes and technologies. To do this work, I take an interpretivist lens and use ethnography (observations, interviews, narratives) and data science methods. I am currently advised by Dr. [Angela D.R. Smith](https://angeladrsmith.com/), Dr. [Amelia Acker](https://www.ameliaacker.com/), and Dr. [Ken Fleischmann](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/people/people-details?PersonID=220).

From 2022-2023, I worked with a marginalized community in India to study how we might approach, understand, and respond to intersections forms of harm and toxicity in digital spaces and reimagine the design of digital spaces to account for their safety and well-being. This work will appear in Computer-Supported for Cooperative Work and Social computing, one of the top-tier venues in HCI research.

From 2021-2023, I was part of Co-designing for Trust, an NSF grant, focused on misinformation and human-centered design. Using qualitative and user research methods, we conducted interviews and workshops with marginalized communities in the US to understand their information practices and propose human-centered approaches to address misinformation. This work has been published in another top-tier venues in HCI research called Human Factors in Computing Systems
(CHI) 2023 and 2024.

Past: I completed my Bachelors in Information Systems from University of Mumbai, followed by M.S. in Data Science and M.Ed. in Learning Sciences with generous funding from [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) School of Education. At Indiana University, I have worked with and been mentored by Drs. [Rebecca Neri](https://ucla.academia.edu/RebeccaNeri), [Norman Su](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~normsu/), and [Phoebe Wakhungu](https://education.indiana.edu/about/directory/profiles/wakhungu-phoebe.html). In this work, I was applying data science skills in higher education, writing about datafication in classroooms, and learning about human-centered design.
