* I am a 1-st year Ph.D. student in the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Guotai Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z2sFN4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Shaoting Zhang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=oiBMWK4AAAAJ&hl=en). 
* My research mainly focuses on the area of medical image computing particularly in data-efficient learning in medical image processing, such as semi-supervised learning and human-in-the-loop, as well as extending them for clinical applicable use.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), on July 1, 2018.


# Recent News
* Dec. 02, 2020. Our paper <b>Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation through Dual-task Consistency</b> was accepted by <b>AAAI 2021</b> (~21% acceptance rate).
* Oct. 07, 2020. We released a code base and some examples (both 2D and 3D) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation research, the repo at [SSL4MIS](https://github.com/HiLab-git/SSL4MIS), any advice and suggestions are welcomed
