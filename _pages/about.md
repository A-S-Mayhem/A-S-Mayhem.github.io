I am a Ph.D. candidate at Monash University, supervised by [Prof. Shirui Pan](https://shiruipan.github.io/), [Dr. Daokun Zhang](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/daokun-zhang), and [A/Prof. Vincent Lee](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/vincent-lee). I obtained my B.S. degree and M.S. degree from Beihang University in 2017 and 2020, respectively. My research interests are in graph representation learning and graph neural networks, with a special focus on unsupervised and weak-supervised scenarios. I am a recipient of the Google Ph.D. Fellowship in 2022.
