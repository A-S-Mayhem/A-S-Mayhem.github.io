I am a PhD student at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io). I mainly work on sustainability related problems (currently focused on air quality). I am interested in probabilistic modeling and Bayesian methods.   


Previously, I worked in CTO's R&D team at [Inspirisys Solutions Ltd.](https://www.inspirisys.com) for six months. I did my M.Tech. from [IIITDM Kancheepuram](https://www.iiitdm.ac.in/) college.
