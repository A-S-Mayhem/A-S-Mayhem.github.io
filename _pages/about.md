Hi! My name is D K Bhargav Achary, most people simply call me "Bhargav"!

After being habituated to ask WHY and HOW 'n' number of times from my early education in Odisha, I have always fascinated for research! And, for finding answers to some of my WHYs on my own, I joined IIT Hyderabad as a Ph.D. student in 2018.

I am in the 3rd year of my Ph.D. in the dept of CSE at IITH, researching in the area of micro-architectural hardware security of Deep Learning. I am a member of <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/biswap/CARS.html" target="_blank">CARS Lab</a> at IITK. I am being jointly supervised by <a href="http://faculty.iitr.ac.in/~sparshfec/" target="_blank">Dr. Sparsh Mittal @ IITR</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/biswap/" target="_blank">Biswa @ IITK</a>.

Prior to joining IITH, I have worked in <a href="https://www.infosys.com/" target="_blank">Infosys Limited</a> and <a href="https://www.drdo.gov.in/" target="_blank">DRDO</a>. I have earned a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and a Diploma in Computer Science and Engineering.

My passion for consumer electronics and computing devices keeps me hooked up in exploring new related technologies and science. Through this website, I would disucss about my research, but also attempt to be a science communicator.

Thanks for visiting!
