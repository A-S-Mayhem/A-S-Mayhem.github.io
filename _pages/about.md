I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering at the [ECE School of the University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece), Iran. I am also working as a research assistant at the Social Networks Lab, where I am under the guidance of [Dr. Masoud Asadpour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MKwwcvIAAAAJ&hl=en). My research primarily centers around Information Extraction from text, and using Representation Learning and Graph Attention Networks to extract textual and structural features from the network

Before embarking on my Master's journey, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran, Iran, in 2020. My undergraduate thesis was focused on Comparison between applying reinforcement learning based methods to solve differential games.
