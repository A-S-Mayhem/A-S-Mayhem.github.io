I'm a fourth-year Ph.D student in the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at California Institute of Technology (Caltech).
I earned my B.S. from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) with a theoretical physics major.
I'm interested in nearly all quantum-related areas, including electronic structure, quantum dynamics, machine learning of quantum chemistry, and quantum computing.
I'm an excellent code with lots of experience of software developing.
I'm also a fan of Linux and traditional chinese music.

Here's my [CV](/files/CV.pdf).
