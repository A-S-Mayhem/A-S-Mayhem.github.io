My name is Yuke Wang, a Second-year Ph.D. student majoring in computer science at UCSB. I have been working on projects related to software-hardware co-design for distance-related algorithms, such as KNN, KMeans. I am also interested in deep learning and algorithm optimization on heterogeneous platforms, such as GPU and FPGA.
