I'm a fourth year PhD student at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm advised by [John Zimmerman](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/john-zimmerman) and [Jim McCann](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jmccann/).

My research focuses on supporting AI teams in designing human-AI interactions. I build tools, methods, and boundary objects that help AI teams in (1) envisioning AI innovations collectively before committing to what AI system to build, and (2) facilitating collaboration and participation across disciplines and stakeholders in AI development processes.

Before Carnegie Mellon, I worked as an industrial designer in the industry for over 7 years, designing products ranging from medical to consumer electronics, assistive robots, and transportation. My work supported the R&D processes of clients across scales, resulting in 25+ shipped products, several patents and design awards. I received my master's and bachelor's in Industrial Design from [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) in Ankara, Turkey.
