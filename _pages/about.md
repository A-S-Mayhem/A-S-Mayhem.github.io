I am a computational and quantitative sociologist studying politics, organizations, networks, and inequality. Currently I am a Sociology PhD candidate at the [University of Arizona](https://sociology.arizona.edu/). My ongoing project combines statistical, network, and computational methods with large-scale datasets to study shareholder activism and corporate political behavior. My work has been published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12419), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [International Journal of Comparative Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1177/0020715219837752), [American Journal of Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1086/703044), and [PLoS One](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/pone.pdf).

To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, I am currently working on a project mapping and predicting social distancing behavior using [SafeGraph](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns) and Facebook data.
