I am Hyunwoo Kwon and I am a junior at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I am also a undergraduate researcher for two research groups at UIUC. I have been participating in building automation setups for both research groups in order to save time from performing time-consuming tasks from designing the setup to software capabilities. Please check out my portfolio for the works that I have done.

I have an interest in combining my knowledge in mechanical engineering with programming skillset that I currently have and are working on several projects that have yet been released. Here are some projects that are currently in progress: 
  1. FEniCS simulations on Fluid Structure Interaction in Aortic Valve
  2. Using Yolov8 Library to keep track of ball possesion for each team and keep track of pass success rates. 
 
Please contact me for any collaboration on unique projects.
