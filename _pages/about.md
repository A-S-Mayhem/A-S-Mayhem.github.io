I'm a third year undergraduate student studying **Data Science** from the [School of Statistics](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn). I also had an amazing experience in Spring 2024 as an exchange student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu). I'm fortunate to join the [S-Data Science Lab](https://github.com/SDS-Lab) and work under [Prof. Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io).
