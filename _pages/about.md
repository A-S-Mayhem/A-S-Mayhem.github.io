Hello! My name is **Junhan Zhang (Julien, 张峻涵)**. I am currently a Master's student majoring in Intellectual Property Management at the Shanghai International College of Intellectual Property (SICIP) at Tongji University.

## About Me

My primary research interests focus on technology and innovation management, particularly in the area of technology transfer between universities and industries. Before joining SICIP for my studies in Intellectual Property Management, I majored in Geophysics at the School of Ocean and Earth Science at Tongji University.
