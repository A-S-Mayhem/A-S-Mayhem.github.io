Hello I am Zach Mackin!

I am a Senior studying Statistics and Computer Science at the [University of California Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). My research interests are centered upon High-Dimensional Data Analysis, Interpretable Deep Learning, Forecasting, and Physics-informed Machine Learning. I most recently have done research with the [Center for Human Sleep Science](https://www.humansleepscience.com/). I am currently a Data Engineer Intern on the Public Safety Power Shutoff team at [PG&E](https://www.pge.com/).

My research is in a multitude of areas such as exploring a country's risk of defaulting with the [Economist Intellingence Unit](https://eiu.com),  accounting for growth in pollution within the Chesapeake Bay with the [Chesapeake Legal Alliance](https://chesapeakelegal.org), and effectively developing UAVs with [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).

Additionally, I have extensive teaching experiences within Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Data Science courses.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, golf, disc golf, traveling, and making models to predict sporting events (read a little about this in my most recent [blog post](). 

Thank you for visiting my page! To reach out you can send an email to zachmackin (at) berkeley (dot) edu or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-mackin-408ba51bb/).
