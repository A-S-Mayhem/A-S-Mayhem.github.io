Hi! I am a first-year doctoral student in [School of Information] (https://ischool.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin] (https://www.utexas.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Ahmer Arif] (https://ahmerarif.com/), [Dr. Angela Smith], (https://angeladrsmith.com/) and [Dr. Kenneth Fleischmann] (https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/people/people-details?PersonID=220). I am a mixed-methods researcher who focuses on human-centered design of learning environments that meets the need of marginalized voices.

I obtained my B.Eng. in Information Technology from University of Mumbai, M.S. in Data Science and M.Ed. in Learning Sciences from [Indiana University Bloomington] (https://www.indiana.edu/).
