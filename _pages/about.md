I'm a master student in 'Stochastics and Data science' at the University of Turin and a [Senior Allievo at Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/education/allievi-honors-program/). 
I obtained my B.sc. at the University of Bologna, where I was supervised by [Christian Hennig](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/christian.hennig/).
