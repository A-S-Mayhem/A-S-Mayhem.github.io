About Me
======
I'm a 4th year PhD student at Center for Artificial Intelligence, Wake Forest University, where I'm focusing on Deep learning and Medical Image Analysis. I'm currently advised by Dr. Metin Gurcan and Dr. M. Khalid Khan Niazi. I'm also a PhD student in the joint BMES school of Virginia Tech and Wake Forest. Before that, I worked as a research associate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with Dr. Fenglei Fan and Dr. Ge Wang. I received a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2020, and a Bachelor's degree in Electronic&Information Science from Shandong University in 2018.

Research Interests
