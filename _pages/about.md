I'm a second-year PhD student from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GuangZhou)]([https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/]). My research interests include corporate governance, sustainability, CSR, and innovation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jinyu he]([https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=148])
