# About Me

I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science at UC San Diego where I was supervised by Sanjoy Dasgupta and Tajana Rosing. I will be joining the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at UC Berkeley as a postdoc in early September. My research interests are in neurally plausible models of representation and information processing. I focus in particular on computing using randomized distributed representations of data.

I received my Bachelor of Science, with high honors, in Agricultural Economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2013 and previously worked as a Senior Research Analyst at Brown University for Justine Hastings and Jesse Shapiro.
