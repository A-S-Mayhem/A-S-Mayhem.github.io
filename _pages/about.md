I'm Leonardo Pacciani-Mori /leo&#39;nardo pa&#39;tʃːani &#39;mɔːri/, a PhD student in Physics at the University of Padua. I work in the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> under the supervision of Amos Maritan and Samir Suweis. I have also been appointed as *Fellow of the Department of Physics* at Harvard University, working in [David Nelson's](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/nelson){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> and [Andrew Murray's](https://murraylab.fas.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> groups under the supervision of [Andrea Giometto](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/andrea-giometto){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.

<!--I work in the broad field of biological physics: I use methods and approaches characteristic of statistical physics to create models of biological and living systems.<br>-->
My main research interest is microbial competition. In particular, I study consumer-resource model to understand better how many species can coexist while competing for common resources. I am currently interested in studying how metabolic adaptation (i.e., the ability of microbes to change energy source according to environmental conditions) can help us understand better how many different species can coexist in competitive setting. Recently, I am also interested in studying how we can rewrite consumer-resource models so that we can describe microbial communities at an "intermediate" level of complexity, i.e. describing their population dynamics while at the same time retaining insights on the molecular aspects of growth.

### Map
<p>Here is a map of all the places where I have either given an <span style="color:#CA2C28">invited</span> or a <span style="color:#2981CA">contributed talk</span>, presented a  <span style="color:#CB6B2B">poster</span>, attended an <span style="color:#2BB7CB">event</span>, or spent a significant <span style="color:#6C28CA">period</span> (click any marker for more information). In case of an online meeting, the marker is located in the place where the meeting has been organized. Click any cluster to zoom and expand it.<!--, and use the layer control menu to select which category to show:--></p>

## My work at a glance
<p>Below is a network representing my publications and collaborations; the color of each node specifies if it represents <span style="color:#1722C1">co-authors</span>, <span style="color:#90d185">preprints</span>, <span style="color:#138400">publications</span> or <span style="color:#8e20c1">theses</span> (in this case co-authors are supervisors). Hover and click on each node for more information, or drag them around to change the network's shape:</p>
