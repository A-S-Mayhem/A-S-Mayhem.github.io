I am a Ph.D. student in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. My research fields are labor economics and data science, and  interests include discrimination, criminal justice, algorithmic bias, and incorporating machine learning methodology into more traditional econometric analysis. 

Previously, I was a predoctoral fellow at the Industrial Relations Section, where I analyzed discrimination in the criminal justice system, investigated how the opioid crisis impacted labor market outcomes, and created novel datasets to measure growing inequality in the labor market, in particular in the music industry. I am a graduate of Wellesley College, where I studied economics and math. 

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, bikram yoga, listening to political podcasts, reading biographies of powerful women, baking, drinking coffee and tacos of all forms.
