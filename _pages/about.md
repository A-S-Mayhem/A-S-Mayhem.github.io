I am a graduate student at Arizona State University pursuing M. S. Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity. My interests lie at the intersection of **Software and Network Security and Privacy, Artificial Intelligence, Game Development, and Algorithms.**

I am currently working as an undergraduate thesis researcher at IHMI Lab at BITS Pilani under the supervision of [Dr. Surjya Ghosh](https://surjya-ghosh.github.io/) focused on Human Computer Interaction. 

I am always looking for opportunities to work on interesting projects. Feel free to reach out to me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aastha-rastogi/).
