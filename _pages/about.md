I am a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) in Music Education with emphasis in Piano Pedagogy at Louisiana State University. My research focuses on the interface between psychology and piano pedagogy, with special attention to motivation and interest development in piano students.

Areas of interest
======
1. Piano pedagogy
2. Music education research
3. Piano performance

Research philosophy
------
I aim for my research to be interdisciplinary and application oriented. 

Teaching philosophy
------
The student that leaves my class is one who loves experiencing music in all its dimensions, a student that loves learning, and that is not afraid of to ask the BIG questions. I aspire for the student who leaves my class to be not only the one that reads music effectively and participates with a fulfillment feeling in studio recitals, or small and informal ensembles, but also feels free to take their own path and expresses their own creativity by exploring his/her/their only and unique voice. He/she/they are aware of his/her/their sociocultural environment, and recognizes the crucial role that he/she/they have in the community. If so, I will know that my teaching was successful, if not, I will keep working harder to be the teacher that he/she/they deserve, and to keep up with the high standard of teaching quality that I learned from my previous music teachers as well
