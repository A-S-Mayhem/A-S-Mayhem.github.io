My experience as an information professional began when I developed the Polk County (Florida) School Board website. Following this, I served as aÂ technology teacher and school network manager. My responsibilities in these positions included overseeing a large school network, training teachers and staff, and developing a technology plan and budget.

I currently serve as pastor of New Mount Vernon United Methodist Church in Winston Salem, NC, where I teach church members using scripture, historic examples, and contemporary sources. I have served as a pastor in the Western North Carolina Conference since I graduated from Duke Divinity School in 2008.
