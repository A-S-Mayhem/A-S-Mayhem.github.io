I completed my Master of Engineering (Mechanical) at the University of Melbourne in 2016. In 2015 I worked as a research assistant in the Fluid Dynamics lab at Melbourne before completing an exchange semester at ETH Zurich. My final year Master's thesis was a combined project with the University of Melbourne and The Northern Hospital, performing computational fluid dynamics studies on patient-specific coronary arteries.

In 2017 I commenced my PhD in Robotic Vision under the supervision of Rob Mahony at the ANU. My PhD topic is the development of novel optical flow algorithms capable of running in real-time for high-speed robotics applications. I am currently pursuing this research using event cameras, which are bio-inspired vision sensors with microsecond temporal resolution.
