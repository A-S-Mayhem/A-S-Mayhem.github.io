I am a geoscientist, interested in measurement tools that can reveal patterns of erosion, weathering, regolith formation and biogeochemical cycling. These tools include geochemical, isotopic and geophysical methods along with numerical and statistical models. Integrating these measurements can help in understanding connection between life and landscape and making progress in understanding how natural processes and humans shape Earthâ€™s surface.
