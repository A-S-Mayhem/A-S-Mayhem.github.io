I am currently studying my M.Sc. in data science and engineering at [DAUIN](https://www.dauin.polito.it/), [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en). I studied my B.Sc. in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer engineering at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). My main research interests are  deep learning, reinforcement learning, spiking neural networks and computationalneuroscience, and computational cognitive science.

For more details, please check out my [CV](https://hafezgh.github.io/cv/cv.pdf) or send me an [email](mailto:hafez.ghaemi@studenti.polito.it).
