**Mini Bio**: I am a Lecturer in Spacecraft Engineering at Queen Mary University of London in the UK. Previously, I was fortunate to spend a year at the DARTS Lab, researching computational multibody robot dynamics
 under [Dr. Abhi Jain](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/who-we-are/people/abhinandan_jain/), at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This led up to a postdocotoral appointment at the
[Surrey Space Centre](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/surrey-space-centre) based within the University of Surrey- here, I worked with [SSTL](https://www.sstl.co.uk) and Airbus to develop missions, architectures, and technology
development/demonstration plans for in-space robotic assembly alongside driving development of lab-based testbed along these lines. It is these experiences that got me into the field of space robotics despite,
 building upon a fundamental engineering science-based PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California, Davis.
