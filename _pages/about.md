Hello! I'm a Data Scientists currently finishing up my PhD at Lousiana State University. Currently, my dissertaion research is looking at macroscale patterns of CO2 in flowing freshwaters across the United States. Throught my studies I have focused on ecological data where in undergrad I earned a BS in Fish and Wildlife Bilogy. Although ecology and hydrology are my background, above all I just like working with data.

After graduation, I plan to pursure a postions as a data scientist.

I have two objectives in creating this site:

1. Showcase academic and nonacademic data science projects (\textit{i.e.}, portfolio) for potential future employers.
2. Throughout my past work experience, academic studies, and my current role as a graduate researcher I have picked up a few skills that I think others may find usefull. So, I am including a blog section and hope to contribute regularly.

Have a look around and reach out for questions or if you find anthing helpfull!
