I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of AI in Management, LMU Munich. I do causal machine learning research under the supervision of [prof. Stefan Feuerriegel](https://www.ai.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/index.html).

I believe in the data-driven automation and human-computer cooperation â€“ they should become the main booster of sustainable development and inclusive society.

My research interests include 
- Causal Inference 
- Causal Machine Learning 
- Causal Representation Learning
- Probabilistic Modelling
