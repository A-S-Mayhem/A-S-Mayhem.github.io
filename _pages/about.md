Iam currently pursuing the master's degree in traffic and transportation with the School of Traffic and Transportation, [Lanzhou Jiaotong University](https://www.lzjtu.cn/), Lanzhou China. I received the B.Edegree in traffic and transportation from Lanzhou Jiaotong University.

Because of a strong interest in machine learing and deep learning, my current research centers on the area of deep learning, automated driving, transportation big data. I have praticipated in coursera's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?) and [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course form Aug.2021 and obtained the Online course certificate. Meanwhile, I learned about lane detection and studied the application of self pre-training with masked sequential autoencoders, submitted a paper with this research(August.2022). I participated in [HUAWEI 2022 Global AI Challenge](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/activity/starAI2022/algo/) to study intelligent quality detection of lane rendering data.
