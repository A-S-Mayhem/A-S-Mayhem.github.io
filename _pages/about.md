I am a political economist at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=luuk-pieter-hendrik-schmitz) where I started my PhD in 2019. At the moment, I am also a visiting researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Socities](https://www.mpifg.de/person/114102/2733). Previously, I was at Radboud University where I did both my bachelor's and master's in political science, and afterwards stayed on as a junior lecturer for one year.

My academic interest lie at the intersection of international political economy, economic sociology, and EU studies. My current research focuses on the political economy of EU industrial policy. I focus on a range of industrial policy initiatives tied to digitalization, the green transition, and strategic autonomy to understand if, why, and how Europe is shifting away from its ordo-liberal roots in promoting market-enhancing integration. I am also interested in business power, lobbying, and the politics of ideas. My contention is that EU politics in general and socio-economic transformations like (de-)industrialization are the perfect nexus to study these phenomena.

Gustav Mahler once said he worked as a conductor to live, but lived to compose. The great thing about academia is that I never feel forced to choose between work and 'life'. My intellecutal and non-academic passions blur into each other and I wouldn't be the same researcher without my other interests. Talking of which, I am passionate about music of various sorts and from different ages, play the French horn (badly), watch and talk about cinema, take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/136054004@N08/), like to read non-academic books too, do pastry, love to learn languages, and I like to see as much of the world and learn from other people as much as possible.
