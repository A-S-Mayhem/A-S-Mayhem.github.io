Hi! I am currently an algorithm expert in Alimama Ads Tech at Alibaba Group (AliStar, 2021). I received my Ph.D. degree in June 2021 from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and my B.Eng. degree in June 2016 from Wuhan University (WHU).  


Research Interests
======
My research interests are in computational advertising and information retrieval, and broader interests include representation learning, text generation, reinforcement learning, federated learning and their applications in advertising, recommendation and search.   

During my Ph.D., my research interests were in natural language processing and computational social science, especially *opinion mining* and *opinionated/argumentative text generation* in low-resource scenarios (e.g., cross-domain transfer, learning with noisy labels and sequence generation with few paired data).       


News
=====
* Aug. 2023: Our paper about *multi-domain pretraining* for ad ranking was accepted at CIKM 2023. 
* May. 2023: A first-authored paper about RL-based *impression pacing* mechanism was accepted at KDD 2023. 
* Apr. 2023: A first-authored resource paper about *vertical federated learning* benchmark for ad ranking was accepted at SIGIR 2023. 
* Jan. 2023: A co-first authored paper about *multi-domain GNNs* for ad retrieval was accepted at WWW 2023.  
* Aug. 2022: A co-corresponding authored paper about *multi-domain ranking* was accepted at CIKM 2022.  
* Apr. 2022: Three first-authored papers about *calibrated ranking* and *ad creative generation* were accepted at SIGIR 2022 and NAACL 2022.  
* Jan. 2022: A co-first authored paper about *debiased ranking* was accepted at WWW 2022.
