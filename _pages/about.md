I am a computational and quantitative sociologist studying politics, organizations, and inequality. Currently I am a Sociology PhD candidate at the [University of Arizona](https://sociology.arizona.edu/). I am scheduled to defend my dissertation on June 5, 2020. My ongoing project uses statistical, network, and computational methods with large-scale datasets to study the [antecedents](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/zhang_diss_ch1.pdf) and [consequences](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/zhang_diss_ch2.pdf) of shareholder activism sponsored by public pensions and labor unions that seeks to improve corporate political transparency and accountability in the United States after 2000. My work has been published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12419), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [International Journal of Comparative Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1177/0020715219837752), [American Journal of Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1086/703044) and PLOS ONE.
