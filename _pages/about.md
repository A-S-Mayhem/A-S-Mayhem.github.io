Hi there! My name is Aaditya Prasad but I normally go by Aadi. My research interests are centered around the synergy between computational neuroscience and deep learning. Specifically, I focus on developing deep learning based tools and models for understanding the cognitive principles underlying the brain's learning algorithms which I hope can inspire novel, robust deep learning systems. I just graduated from the [University of California, San Diego in bioinformatics](https://biology.ucsd.edu/education/undergrad/maj-min/majors/fall20-later/bioinformatics.html) and I will be joining the [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute's first Master's in data science](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-program-requirements/) cohort. I am currently co-mentored by [Talmo Pereira](https://talmolab.org) and [Uri Manor](https://manor.salk.edu) at [the Salk Institute for Biological Studies](https://www.salk.edu) where I will be continuing for my thesis. After my masters, I hope to complete a PhD in computational neuroscience in order to become a research scientist at a start-up as well as an adjunct professor at a public university. To that end, I am currently open to and actively seeking internships. My current resumé can be found in the [CV section](https://aaprasad.github.io/cv/) of this website or [here in pdf format] (https://aaprasad.github.io/files/Aaditya_Prasad_Resume.pdf. If you want to talk about my research, potential fits in your company/group, collaborations, or just want to chat about anything from video games to philosophy, please don't hesitate to reach out!
