I am currently a Life Science Informatics student at the University of Bonn, Germany. My research interests lie at the intersection of Medical Imaging and Machine Learning. I am particulrly interested in analyzing data from Neuroimaging studies.  In the future, I want to contribute towards enhancing the mechanistic interpretability of neural responses to disease states and communicate findings with a wide audience even outside academia. 

Apart from my academic interests, I enjoy getting to know new people and perspectives. In my free time I like to read popular Science books and dance.
