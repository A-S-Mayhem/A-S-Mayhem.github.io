I'm a second-year graduate student of software engineering at Sun Yat-sen University. I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Jiajing Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EaqeskUAAAAJ&hl=en) at [InPlusLab](https://inpluslab.com/) where [Prof. Zibin Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zWnsNrkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) is lab manager. I also work closely with [Dan Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iTGMohsAAAAJ) at Sun Yat-sen University.

My academic interests center around guarding the security of blockchain.  The anonymity of blockchain  has fostered the emergence of various illegal activities, which poses a fascinating challenge in blockchain security. My primary focus is on Ethereum. In my research, I strive to quantify the possibility of account involvement in crime by proposing a  general framework for account risk rating on Ethereum. Additionally, I actively collect money laundering  datasets of different heists on Ethereum and analyze the traits of  accounts participating in money laundering to fill the gap of anti-money laundering on Ethereum . I also make efforts to trace cross-chain transaction pairs on different blockchain platforms to capture complex transactional behaviors and reveal the relationships between accounts on different blockchain. My research is informed by the fields of finance and security.


In addition to doing research, I also enjoy doing sports and travelling.

I'm looking for a research assistant position to seek more challenging researches on blockchain security. I am excited about the opportunities for collaboration and advancement in my field, and am eager to continue learning and contributing to the research community. If you are willing to learn more about my research or explore potential opportunities for collaboration, I would be honored if you could kindly reach out to me. Thank you for visiting!
