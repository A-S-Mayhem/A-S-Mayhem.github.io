## Welcome!

<div class="text-justify">

This is the course website for the courses ADS: Applied Data Analysis and Visualization (201900027; part of the Utrecht University wide minor <a href="https://students.uu.nl/en/academics/minors/applied-data-science" target="_blank">Applied Data Science</a>), and Applied Data Analysis and Visualization 1 for Economists (ECB2ADAVE; part of the minor Applied Data Science for Economists). These courses will be taught in parallel. When content is course-specific, it will be mentioned explicitly.

During this course, you will actively learn how to apply the main statistical methods in data analysis and how to use machine learning algorithms and visualizing techniques. The course has a strongly practical, hands-on focus: rather than focusing on the mathematics and background of the discussed techniques, you will gain hands-on experience in using them on real data during the course and interpreting the results. This course covers both classical and modern topics in data analysis and visualization.
