Dear reader, I am a PhD student at Sorbonne University working with the [DELYS](https://team.inria.fr/delys/) team in LIP6/Inria in Paris. Previously i was with the [AGPL](https://pl.cs.uni-kl.de/homepage/en/) team in TU Kaiserslautern where i did my Master's thesis on [AntidoteDB](https://www.antidotedb.eu). 

My primary area of research is Distributed Systems. I am studying the strategies to **Optimise Coordination in Concurrent and Geo-Distributed Systems**. This relates to developing a pragmatic approach to optimise concurrency control in actual, complex applications. The goal is to develop a tool that assists developers in identifying the concurrency control and coordination required to achieve correctness.
