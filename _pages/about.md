I'm a software engineer with a deep interest in how technology can make a difference in agriculture. My journey in this field began at General Aeronautics, and agriculture drone manufacture, where I worked on projects that directly benefited thousands of farmers by improving their ability to make data-driven decisions. From developing real-time drone data systems to architecting scalable solutions, I've seen how tech can transform traditional farming into something more efficient and sustainable.

My work is driven by a desire to solve practical problems. My research interest are in applying machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics to agriculture, focusing on creating tools that help farmers optimize their resources and improve crop health. My background in Computer Science has equipped me with the technical skills needed to tackle these challenges, but it's my hands-on experience that has truly shaped my approach.

I'm particularly interested in the potential of precision agriculture and how it can address some of the biggest challenges in global food security. By combining my technical expertise with a strong focus on impact, I aim to develop solutions that are practical and accessible to those who need them most.

Web Scraping Approaches and their Performance on Modern Websites
------

Bots account for a significant portion of internet traffic, with many engaging in web scraping to extract data from websites. This paper explores seven different web scraping methods, ranging from basic HTTP requests to advanced techniques using Selenium and undetectable Chrome drivers. The study tests these methods on 120 websites across various categories, analyzing their effectiveness in data extraction and the ability of websites to detect and block these bots. Results are visualized through graphs, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

MaskCop
------
Developed and deployed an accurate (92%) automated mask detection system using Python, OpenCV, and Ten-
sorFlow. This system integrated seamlessly within the department, enhancing campus safety protocols by enabling automated
warnings for mask policy violations.

WebSight Dynamics: Analytics of Top Websites. 
------
A comprehensive analytics project involved in developing seven distinct
web-scraping bots to mine data from 120 top-tier websites. The findings were published in an IEEE conference, showcasing the
projectâ€™s blend of technical prowess and ethical considerations

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
