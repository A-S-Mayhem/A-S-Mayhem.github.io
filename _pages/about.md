I’m a senior Computer Science major, pursuing a profession in research and currently applying to PhD programs in Computer Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning. I am interested in the security of machine learning systems and the use of machine learning – as well as other methods – towards approaching broader problems in the spaces of application, network, and systems security. Apart from this, I am also interested in genetic algorithms, privacy, and tech policy.

Since May 2021, I have worked for Pomona College's ARCS (Autonomous Robotics and Complex Systems) Lab, where I relate my research interests to problems in robotics, focusing on creative methods to ease the pain of sim-to-real transfer. Beyond the lab, I have interned at AT&T, where I researched and implemented sentiment analysis models for fraud detection and explainable ML methods for key sentiment identification. I have also interned at Meta, where I created a social media app for surfers.

These days, I am working on two projects: my senior thesis and an ARCS Lab project on adversarial training. For my senior thesis, I am researching methods of protecting federated learning systems from post-breach evasion attacks. In the ARCS Lab, I am researching and implementing adversarial example generation algorithms for the adversarial training of our computer vision models.

In my free time, I like to play guitar and surf. But not at the same time...
