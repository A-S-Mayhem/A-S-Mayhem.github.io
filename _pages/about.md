I am a first year PhD student at the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford. I am supervised by [Gesine Reinert](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~reinert/) and [Vidit Nanda](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/). Previously, I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [PolyAI](https://www.polyai.com/) and [DigitalGenius](https://www.digitalgenius.com/). Before that, I studied Mathematics and Philosophy at Oxford.

My interests lie at the intersection of applied topology and statistics, especially with aplications to analysis of non-Euclidean data.
