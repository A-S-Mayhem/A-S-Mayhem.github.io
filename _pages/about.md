Hello, I am **Natalí Soler Matubaro de Santi**, a theoretical physicist interested in cosmology, data science and machine learning. Currently, I am a PhD candidate of Institute of Physics at University of São Paulo (USP), working with Professor Raul Abramo (and he has a pretty nice [webpage](http://www.fma.if.usp.br/~abramo/Home.html), check out!).

First things first, a little **about me**:

Since I was a child I am fascinated by science, mostly Astronomy and Physics, and computers (as you can see in the below pic I was only 4 years old and I have strong abilities to draw cute ducks in Paint  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).

This passion led me to participate in olympiads on Astronomy since I was young. During high school I had the opportunity to develop a work of experimental scientific pre-initiation in superconductivity, at USP of São Carlos. This opportunity was the trigger for me to decide to study Physics instead of Astronomy, and I was able to graduate from USP in my hometown. At the beginning of the course I continued with an experimental scientific initiation in material physics. My interest in computation and theoretical physics led me to my second scientific initiation, in Particle Physics. After graduation, I changed university, to do my master's degree on the other side of the city, at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar). I was able to study General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes, doing a review work on Hawking radiation and discussing the temporal evolution of Schwarzchild's black hole mass, considering this effect. Today, at the doctorate, I have the privilege of being able to adventure in Cosmology, now at USP of São Paulo, capital. The focus of my current research is to study large-scale structures using machine learning methods. This new journey is being wonderful!

**This page**:

In this page I want to share a little about the fantastic world of my research topic and my work. So, you could see since how to simulate the Universe on a computer to machine learning techniques.
