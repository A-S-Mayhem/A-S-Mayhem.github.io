I am a Ph.D. candidate under the guidance of [Professor Kristina Yordanova](http://stenialo.org/about-me/) at the Institute of Data Science, University of Greifswald, where I am exploring the fascinating fields of Data Science and Natural Language Processing.
Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a Research Assistant at the [University of Rostock](https://www.mmis.informatik.uni-rostock.de/), where I delved into Neural Density Estimation for the project [NEISS](https://www.neiss.uni-rostock.de/). I also had the opportunity to hone my skills as a Software Engineer at [PLANET AI](https://planet-ai.de/), where I contributed to the development and testing of [Intelligent Document Analysis](https://planet-ai.de/products/ida/) software.
