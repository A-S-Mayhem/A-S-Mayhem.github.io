## Join the lab!

### PhD Project on sexual selection and evolution in pipefish
I seek a PhD candidate for a fully-funded 3-year PhD scholarship in the School of Biological Sciences, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.

**Project description:**
My group studies how and why complex traits and behaviors evolve, with a focus on sexually selected traits. We use a number of different methods to address these broad questions: studies of relevant traits and selection on those traits; genomic studies of signatures of selection; and theoretical simulation studies. For more information, please see the lab website: https://flanagan-lab.github.io/. The immediate focus of the lab concerns uncovering the evolutionary processes that have shaped the sexually dimorphic traits in the wide-bodied pipefish, a native species to New Zealand.
This PhD position offers the flexibility for the PhD student to decide on the direction of the doctoral studies within the framework of my research programme. Possible projects include population genomics of native and endemic pipefish; characterizing mating behaviors and sexual selection parameters; and/or simulation-based projects on how the genetic architecture of traits can influence variation. The PhD position has the opportunity to include field, laboratory, and computational-based research.  
The successful candidate will be fully funded, including research costs, with a stipend for three years plus payment of tuition fees and associated service charges.

**The University:**
The University of Canterbury is located in Christchurch, the largest city in New Zealand's South Island. The University has approximately 13,000 students and 2,000 postgraduate students enrolled. The University's modern and well-equipped facilities are spread across a spacious suburban campus, with easy access to the city and the cultural and recreational facilities it provides. There is also good access to the scenic and recreational resources of the Southern Alps and Banks Peninsula. 

**Eligibility:**
I seek a PhD candidate with a demonstrated high level of academic achievement at the undergraduate and/or postgraduate level. The candidate is required to have a BSc (Honours) or a Masters degree to enroll as a PhD candidate at the University of Canterbury. The ideal candidate will have research experience in behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, and/or population genetics and genomics. Previous experience with programming (e.g., R, C/C++, python) and/or molecular techniques and analysis of genomic data is preferred. 

**Application and contact:**
Applications should include a letter of application (cover letter), CV, summary of research experience (no more than 2 pages), and the email addresses of two scientific referees. In the cover letter please include your research interests with potential project topics. The position remains open until filled. 
For more information or to apply please contact me by email:

### Diversity and Equity

My lab is inclusive, welcoming, and committed to advancing diversity; I welcome everyone regardless of their ethnicity, color, socioeconomic background, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, and age. I especially encourage members of historically underrepresented groups including (but not limited to) people of color, women, veterans, and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities to inquire about opportunities and apply to join my group.
