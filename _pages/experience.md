# Research Experience

GSAI, Renmin University of China, Research Intern 
---
2024.03.08 – Now

Supervisor: [Prof. Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io)

Projects: 
- **USPTO-LLM (WWW 2025)**: Constructed the first chemical reaction dataset (USPTO-LLM, 247K entries) containing abundant reaction condition information by using LLM APIs to extract data from the USPTO patent database. Validated the dataset quality on graph-based and sequence-based retrosynthesis models. The dataset is open-sourced at [USPTO-LLM](https://zenodo.org/records/14396156).

- Leveraged OCR to extract high-frequency operating parameters from the transducer screen of the daVinci surgical robot. Processed video frames using OpenCV to minimize noise from parameter fluctuations, achieving an OCR accuracy of 99%.

- Trained a single-layer Transformer Encoder to extract and classify key information from 2,100 after-sales feedbacks of
daVinci surgical robots into 11 categories, which greatly helped after-sales engineers identify issues and provide solutions.
