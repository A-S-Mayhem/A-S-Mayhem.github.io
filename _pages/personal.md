What I really like: Chatting, Reading, Watching Comedy, Hiking, Karaoke, Playing Board Game (especially Othello), and Billiards.

Reading is one of my hobbies. I read about 200-300 books a year, excluding books related to my research. Below, I will list some of my favorite books. If any of them interest you, I would be happy to discuss them with you!
