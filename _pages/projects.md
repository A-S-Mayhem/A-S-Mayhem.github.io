  - Heterogeneous Graph Network for Multi-page Document Visual Question Answering
  - Processed multimodalities data, ex: word text, OCR bouding box and document image
  - Built up the single-modalitiy knowledge graph and multi-modalities knowledge graph
  - Implemented a graph neural network with T5

- Deep learning project, Spring 2023 [GitHub](https://github.com/ting-chih/CS5814-final-project)  [Report](https://ting-chih.github.io/files/5814.pdf)  
  - Fine-Grained Image Captioning
  - Implemented image captioning with ExpansionNet in Flicker30K
