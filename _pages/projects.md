<b> Main Projects </b>
<br>
1. Computational neurethological basis of primate touch: brief description with impact...
2. Neural correlates of natural social primate behavior: a state-of-the-art project combining wireless neurophysiology and deep learning-based computer vision to characterize the neural mechanisms underlying rhesus macaque social behavior. Colab with: [Camille Testard](...), [Sebastien Tremblay](...)
3. [_MacSuite_](another link which explains v1 of Mac in detail): my passion project for bringing computational tools to primatologists within and beyond the lab
<br>
<b> Collaborations </b>
<br>
1. Neonatologist gaze classification: a deep learning-based computer vision application to predict and quantify where a neonatologist is attending to during neonatal resuscitation. <b>With:</b> [Heidi Herrick]()
2. Human foragers on the ADHD spectrum: explore-exploit decision making as a biomarker for ADHD diagnoses. <b>With:</b> [David Barack](), [Vera Ludwig]()
3. How do dance kinematics vary across genre? A computer vision application for analyzing human dance. <b>With:</b> [Ben Baker]()
4. Relating open-field kinematics to transcendental phenomenology: an ambitious attempt using computer vision  for studying the physicality of phenomenology. <b>With:</b> [Scott Rennie](), [Razvan Sandru](), [Zachary Mainen]()

2. MacTrack: Automated, Multi-Camera Tracking System for Socializing Primates
3. MacFace: Unsupervised discovery of non-human primate facial Expressions
4. MacID: Real-time, automated face recognition of Cayo Santiago Group V primates
> With: Camille Testard, Clare Kimock, Lauren Brent
5. MacHand: automated, multi-hand pose tracking of wild Old World monkeys and Great Apes
> With: Jordan Matelsky, Catherine Hobaiter
6. RL for animal behavior: RL agents can help us understand... i previously explored imitation learning using "expert" human gait data to teach agents to walk from scratch. the last 1/3 of my phd will be devoted to exploring the potential of IRL to model social primate behavior
