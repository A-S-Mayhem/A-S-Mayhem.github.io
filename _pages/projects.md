## Deep learning-based breast cancer metastasis classification on whole slide images
The small size of tumor lesions poses a challenge for current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models in accurately classifying Whole Slide Images (WSI). To address this, we have introduced innovative weakly supervised learning techniques that effectively emphasize small tumor regions, resulting in enhanced accuracy and interpretability.
