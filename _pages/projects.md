This project explores the intricate relationship between community walkability and various facets of well-being in urban environments, with a focus on New York City neighborhoods.

## **Objective:**
Investigate correlations between walkability and well-being indicators, such as concentrated poverty rates and student obesity rates.

## **Methodology:**
Collected data on NYC walkability, poverty, and obesity. Utilized Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for preprocessing and visualization. Merged datasets for comprehensive analysis.

## **Results:**
No significant correlation between walkability and poverty. Identified higher obesity rates in less walkable NYC neighborhoods.
