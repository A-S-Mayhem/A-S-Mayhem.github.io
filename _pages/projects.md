### Ongoing Projects

Graph Contraction Algorithms
======
Supervisor: Prof. Yihan Sun
* An efficient preprocess algorithm that creates shortcuts for large diameter graphs.
* Significantly boost the parallel SSSP algorithm by decreasing the total spam in parallel algorithms.

### Previous Projects

Noctua (To appear in EuroSys 24)
======
Supervisor: Prof. Cheng Li
* A fully automated verification framework for understanding fine-grained consistency semantics in web applications.
* Implements a light weight program analyzer that translates the consistency-related effects into an IR.
* Leverage a powerful SMT solver Z3 to build a verification backend.

Bazinga Compiler
======
Github: https://github.com/zhuez16/bazinga_compiler
* A full-stack self-implemented compiler including lexical analyzer, parser, intermediate code generator, optimizing passes and ARM code generator.
* Won the 3rd prize of the HUAWEI Bisheng Cup in 2021.

ustc-nscscc-2020-1
======
Github: https://github.com/zhuez16/ustc-nscscc-2020-1
* A 5-stage MIPS processor, and can be set up in a FPGA directly.
* Supports P-mon system and VGA output.
* Won the 2nd prize of the Loongson Cup in 2020.
