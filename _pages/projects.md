Course Projects
===============

- **Multimodal vision project**, Spring 2023 [GitHub](https://github.com/ting-chih/CS6804-final-project) [Report](https://ting-chih.github.io/files/6804.pdf)  

- **Deep learning project**, Spring 2023 [GitHub](https://github.com/ting-chih/CS5814-final-project)  [Report](https://ting-chih.github.io/files/5814.pdf)  
  - Topic: Fine-Grained Image Captioning
  - Developed an image captioning system using ExpansionNet with the Flicker30K dataset
  - Assessed the effectiveness of visual embeddings. The system achieved an impressive BLEU‑1 score of 67.76

- **Security project**, Fall 2022 [GitHub](https://github.com/ting-chih/CS5914-final-project)  [Report](https://ting-chih.github.io/files/5914.pdf)  
  - Topic: Attacking On Disrupting-Deepfakes: Methodology Transferability And Perturbation Removal
  - Designed an auto‑encoder to eliminate disruptions in deepfakes, examining its transferability across various deepfake models
  - Validated that the perturbed images had no adverse effects on the performance of other deepfake models, resulting in an MSE score of 0.75

- **Machine learning project**, Spring 2022 [GitHub](https://github.com/ting-chih/CS4824-final-project)  [Report](https://ting-chih.github.io/files/4824.pdf)  
  - Topic: News Category Prediction
  - Applied Naive Bayes with TF‑IDF for news category prediction
  - Assessed the model’s performance using F1 score, accuracy, and confusion matrix, achieving a 63% accuracy.

- **Undergradute senior project**, Spring 2019
  - Topic: Data Distribution Strategy With High Computational Efficiency In Spark
  - Deployed a distribution system on Hadoop to enhance data distribution and processing capabilities
  - Explored and implemented optimization techniques to improve the performance of Hadoop in handling large-scale data processing tasks
