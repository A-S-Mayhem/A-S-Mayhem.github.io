### [2019b] Multi-Vehicle Detection and Tracking from Unmanned Aerial Videos. [link](https://jwangjie.github.io/publication/rsmdpi2019)

This project developed a deep-learning pipeline for multiple vehicle detection and tracking from UAV videos. This approach works reliably for vehicle tracking with significant orientation and scale variations. The vehicle speed estimation method is currently under development.

### [2019c] AlphaPilot AI Drone Challenge machine vision test. [link](https://github.com/jwangjie/winnet-perception-AlphaPilot)

The project contains two parts: a CNN for window corner position detection of AlphaPilot machine vision test and a ROS perception node "winnet" for the future closed-loop controls.

### [2019d] Mapping quality evaluation of monocular SLAM solutions for UAVs. [link]()

The geometric quality of the 3D maps generated by the state-of-the-art monocular SLAM solutions (LSD-SLAM, ORB-SLAM2, and LDSO) implemented on a low-cost MAV is evaluated.

### [2018a] Imitation Learning for a self-driving car in Unity simulator. [link](https://github.com/jwangjie/SDC-Behavioral-Cloning-P3)

The goal of the project is to train a CNN to drive autonomously in a simulator. The project is a simulation implementation of the "End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars" [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf) by NVIDIA. The CNN implemented in the project is differnet to the one in the paper, more details are explained [here](https://github.com/jwangjie/SDC-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/blob/master/Behavioral%20Cloning.pdf).
