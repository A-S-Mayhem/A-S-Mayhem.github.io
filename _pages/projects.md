<b> Main Projects </b>
<br>
1. Computational neurethological basis of primate touch: brief description with impact...
2. Neural correlates of natural social primate behavior: a state-of-the-art project combining wireless neurophysiology and deep learning-based computer vision to characterize the neural mechanisms underlying rhesus macaque social behavior. Colab with: [Camille Testard](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=0o2ZT8wAAAAJ&hl=en), [Sebastien Tremblay]([...](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=xYsnAngAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate))
3. [_MacSuite_](https://felipe-parodi.github.io//macsuite/): my passion project for bringing computational tools to primatologists within and beyond the lab
