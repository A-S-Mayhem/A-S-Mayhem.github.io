- Virginia Tech Multimodal vision project
  - Heterogeneous Graph Network for Multi-page Document Visual Question Answering, Spring 2023
  - Processed multimodalities data, ex: word text, OCR bouding box and document image
  - Built up the single-modalitiy knowledge graph and multi-modalities knowledge graph
  - Implemented a graph neural network with T5

- Virginia Tech Deep learning project
  - Fine-Grained Image Captioning, Spring 2023
  - Implemented image captioning with ExpansionNet in Flicker30K
  - Explored the performance of different visual embeddings(ViT and Swin Transformer)

- Virginia Tech Security project
  - Attacking On Disrupting-Deepfakes: Methodology Transferability And Perturbation Removal, Fall 2022
  - Built up an auto-encoder to remove perturbation from disrupting deepfakes
  - Proved the perturbed images cannot affect other deepfakes models
