Course Projects
===============

- Multimodal vision project, Spring 2023 [GitHub](https://github.com/ting-chih/CS6804-final-project) [Report](https://ting-chih.github.io/files/6804.pdf)  
  - Topic: Heterogeneous Graph Network for Multi-page Document Visual Question Answering
  - Processed diverse multimodal data, including word text, OCR bounding box information, and document images
  - Constructed both single-modality and multi-modality knowledge graphs to represent the underlying relationships in the data
  - Implemented a graph neural network leveraging T5, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze and extract insights from the knowledge graphs

- Deep learning project, Spring 2023 [GitHub](https://github.com/ting-chih/CS5814-final-project)  [Report](https://ting-chih.github.io/files/5814.pdf)  
  - Topic: Fine-Grained Image Captioning
  - Implemented an image captioning system using ExpansionNet on the Flicker30K dataset
  - Explored and evaluated the performance of different visual embeddings, including Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer

- Security project, Fall 2022 [GitHub](https://github.com/ting-chih/CS5914-final-project)  [Report](https://ting-chih.github.io/files/5914.pdf)  
  - Topic: Attacking On Disrupting-Deepfakes: Methodology Transferability And Perturbation Removal
  - Developed an auto-encoder framework specifically designed to remove perturbations from disrupting deepfakes
  - Investigated the transferability of the methodology by evaluating its effectiveness on multiple deepfake models
  - Demonstrated that the perturbed images generated by the methodology did not impact the performance or functionality of other deepfake models

- Machine learning project, Spring 2022 [GitHub](https://github.com/ting-chih/CS4824-final-project)  [Report](https://ting-chih.github.io/files/4824.pdf)  
  - Topic: News Category Prediction
  - Implemented the Naive Bayes algorithm with TF-IDF for the task of news category prediction
  - Evaluated the performance of the model using metrics such as F1 score, accuracy, and confusion matrix

- Undergradute senior project, Spring 2019
  - Topic: Data Distribution Strategy With High Computational Efficiency In Spark
  - Deployed a distribution system on Hadoop to enhance data distribution and processing capabilities
  - Explored and implemented optimization techniques to improve the performance of Hadoop in handling large-scale data processing tasks
