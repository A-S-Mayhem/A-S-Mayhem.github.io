Well, the title itself is pretty convincing - I'm very fond of cats 🐱. Since in this page, I plan to update with my personal interests, therefore, it's worthy to mention, outside working hours, I enjoy playing different sports (especially Cricket and Table-tennis), also painting, coding, hiking, among many other things. 
Out here in this page, I plan to document with my **_code for fun_** projects which I'm recently working on and few blog posts I've jotted down. As the saying goes,
