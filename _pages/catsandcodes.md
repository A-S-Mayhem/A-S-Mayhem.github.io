> Wondering what this page is all about ? Well, I plan to document here, my *code for fun* projects. Ofcourse, I'm fond of cats. There's always been a common notion, you need to be caffenated while you code. Why always coffee & code ‚òï , why not keep a cat & code üê±? Trust me cats can very well syn with your zen mode which you would prefer to maintain ! ‚öñÔ∏è
