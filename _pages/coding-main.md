This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted by [GitHub](https://alcide-zhao.github.io/). All webpages are written in Markdown and html scripts. Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.  See some tutorials on how to [Set up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/). You can also clone my web repository and make necessary changes to build your own from a nutshell. For beginners, I would ecourage you to get yourself familiar with with [Linux command line](https://alcide-zhao.github.io/coding/unix-shell/) programming and [Version Control with Git](https://alcide-zhao.github.io/coding/versio-control/)<br/>

Some quick reference on Markdown syntax can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)<br/>
