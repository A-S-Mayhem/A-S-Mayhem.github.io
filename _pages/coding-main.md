# About this website
This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and histed on [GitHub](https://github.com/aldzhao/genius). All webpages are written in Markdown and html scripts. Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.
