This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and histed on [GitHub](https://github.com/aldzhao/genius). All webpages are written in Markdown and html scripts. Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more. For beginners, you must get familiar with [Linux command line](/coding/unix-shell/) programming. See some tutorials on how to [Set up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/). You can also clone my web repository and make necessary changes to build your web from a nutshell.
