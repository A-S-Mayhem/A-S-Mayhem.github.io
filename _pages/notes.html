## Some Global Annoucements      
The followings are the notes of Max Chen, all of which are taken either during lectures of professors or while I was reading books. I am hoping these notes could be of some assistance to one's study and improvement. None of them is directly copied from others work, so please to do not attempt to discover any lecture slides or homework from this site. I will provide some useful links of study resources in page [Resources](maxgniluynehc.github.io/resources), where you may find real lecture notes/past test/homework of a certain course if they are made available by their author.        
Ultimately, please do NOT attempt to make a profit from any of these works, and please respect the intellectual properties of those professors, authors, and the writer. Thank you and enjoy reading!
