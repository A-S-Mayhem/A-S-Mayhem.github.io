## CALL FOR PAPERS: Contemporary Perspectives in Family Research

### Cohabitation and the Evolving Nature of Intimate and Family Relationships

Contemporary Perspectives in Family Research, an annual series which focuses upon cutting-edge topics in family research around the globe, is seeking manuscript submissions for a special volume. The volume will focus on the theme of **‘Cohabitation and the Evolving Nature of Intimate and Family Relationships.’**  

In societies around the globe, couples are increasingly opting to live together without going through the formal and legal complications of marriage.  Despite the many prevailing stereotypes about cohabitors, such couples are comprised of individuals from the full spectrum of age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and more.  Their rationales for cohabiting are equally expansive, with some regarding the relationship as a short-term fling, while others regard it as a relatively permanent and lasting relationship.  Likewise, many cohabiting couples live as only a couple, while a growing number of cohabiting households also include children.  Given the tremendous diversity in cohabiting couples, as well as the increasing prominence of this form of intimate relationship, there exists a need to better comprehend the structural, affectional, and other characteristics of cohabitation around the world.  This multidisciplinary volume of CPFR will focus upon cohabitation.  In doing so, we are seeking articles that cover a wide array of topics including: transitions into cohabitation, parenting and parental roles, division of domestic labor among cohabitors, sharing of economic resources, elderly cohabitors, legal complications of cohabitation, intimate partner violence, interconnections between cohabitation and marriage, sex and sexuality, assortative mating among cohabiting partners, premarital cohabitation and its consequences, relationship dissolution, gender ideologies, changing patterns of cohabitation, cohabitation and remarriage, and parental cohabitation and child development, among others.
