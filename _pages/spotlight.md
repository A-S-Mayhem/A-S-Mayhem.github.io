    alt: "OH trend"
    title: "Air becomes a more powerful detergent"
    excerpt: 'The hydroxyl radical ([OH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical)) is a highly reactive constituent of the atmosphere. It is thought to be the "detergent" of the troposphere because it reacts with many pollutants and greenhouse gases. As such, it has a big impact on global climate. We found, from the AerChemMIP joint analysis, that the global OH changed little from 1850 to around 1980, then increased by around 10 %, with an associated reduction in methane lifetime. However, this seems to be contradicating those (uncertain) measurement-based trends. Major drivers of OH trends are emissions of CH4, NOx and CO; these will be important for future CH4 trends.'

    alt: "Equilibrium climate change"
    title: "Majority of global warming yet to be seen"
    excerpt: 'Would it shock you to know the global mean warming will be inevitably doubled even if we take actions immediately? I am I exaggerating? and why? Well, the thing is that the climate system, especially the vast ocean, takes long time (~ hundreds of years) to responde to external pertubation. That is, the climate change signals we have seen to date are only addicatives of the transient response to past emission changes. If we allow the whole climate system to asjust after hundreds of years, we will eventually see more warming emerging over time. We used a climate model and found that the global mean warming and precipitation change in response to 1970-2010 emission changes will double the current values, once in equilibrium.'

    alt: "Heatwaves and aerosol particles"
    title: "Boiled or choked?"
    excerpt: 'There will be more severe heatwaves (in terms of intensity, duration, and frequency) in the coming decades  These changes are mainly associated with greenhouse gas increases. However, anthropogenic aerosol changes have important influences, through their effects on clouds and radiation, and produce larger impacts comparing to greenhouse gases per unit of warming. Effects of aerosols on clouds such as changes in cloudiness and other rapid adjustments (e.g., changes in vertical temperature profiles), however, are still poorly represented in present generation climate models, leading to large uncertainties in future heatwave projections. Therefore, we call the attention of the community to prioritize efforts into reducing uncertainties involved in aerosol‐cloud interactions, in order to get reliable projections of future climate extremes, as well as effective strategies for climate risk management.'
