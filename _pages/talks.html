Bio
======

I was born in Assam in a village called Dhalpur, which lies on Brahmaputra's northern bank and at the foothills of Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya in the year 1985. Science and the unknown have always fascinated me since my childhood. I am the first person in my family to pursue higher studies. I studied geological sciences at Gauhati University (the oldest university in Assam). After receiving B.Sc. and M.Sc. from Gauhati University and  M.Tech. from Dibrugarh University, Assam, I moved to Mumbai in 2014 to pursue my PhD at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) under supervison of Prof. George Mathew. After receiving my PhD in 2020, I started a postdoc until 2022 in IITB. <p><b>It was the best eight years and a life-transforming journey at IITB</b></p>. Then, I moved to Uttarakhand to begin my first job as an Assistant professor at SDSU University, Rishikesh. In August 2023, I moved to Bengaluru to join as a researcher in the Earth Sciences lab at Prayoga Institute of Education Research (Prayoga), my current home.
I deeply care about student education and feel strongly about maintaining high standards when mentoring, advising, and teaching students. I use a combined approach that involves teaching content with an experiential learning approach, including 'hands-on learning' through laboratory experiments and fieldwork and 'reflection-on doing' in the classrooms. My approach to mentoring students is always focused on facilitating basic knowledge and constant support for students to conduct their research independently and critically. The main element of my approach is to develop a high level of independence in the student regarding both scientific approach and decision-making. I am committed to developing, growing, and maintaining a vibrant research atmosphere.
When not in the office, lab, or field, I like playing badminton, swimming, running, meditating, studying philosophy and spirituality, and traveling with my wife.
