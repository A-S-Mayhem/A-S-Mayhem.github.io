I am also one of the organizers of category theory reading group (CARGO) at at the school of computer science which meets on every Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. in room 245. Here is the archive of talks: <a href="http://talks.bham.ac.uk/show/archive/1233" target="_blank"><font color="B22222">CARGO</font></a>. Feel free to subscribe to our <a href= "https://mailman.cs.bham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/cargo/" target="_blank"><font color="B22222">mailing list</font></a>.  Sometimes I find enough time and I write the notes of talks I give in CARGO. You can find them here:
