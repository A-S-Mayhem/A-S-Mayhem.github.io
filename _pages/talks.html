I was born in Assam in a village called Dhalpur, which lies on Brahmaputra's northern bank and at the foothills of Arunachal Pradesh 
Himalaya. Science and the unknown have always fascinated me since childhood and the first person in my family 
to pursue higher studies. I studied geological sciences at Gauhati University (the oldest university in Assam). After receiving B.Sc. 
and M.Sc. from Gauhati University and  M.Tech. from Dibrugarh University, Assam, moved to Mumbai in 2014 to pursue my PhD (Earth Sciences) at the 
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) under the supervision of Prof. George Mathew. After receiving my PhD in 2020, started a postdoc until 2022 at IITB. 
<b>It was my best eight years and a life-transforming journey at IITB</b>. Then, moved to Uttarakhand to begin my first job as an Assistant professor
at SDSU University, Rishikesh. In August 2023, moved to Bengaluru to join as a researcher in the Earth Sciences lab at Prayoga Institute of Education Research 
(Prayoga), my current home.
<p>I deeply cares about student education and feels strongly about maintaining high standards when mentoring, advising, and teaching students. I use a combined approach 
that involves teaching content with an experiential learning approach, including 'hands-on learning' through laboratory experiments and fieldwork and 'reflection-on
doing' in the classrooms. My approach to mentoring students always focuses on facilitating basic knowledge and constant support for students to conduct their
research independently and critically. The main element of the approach is to develop a high level of independence in the student regarding both scientific approach 
and decision-making. I am committed to developing, growing, and maintaining a vibrant research atmosphere and enjoys working in interdisciplinary science research and education aspects. </p>
<p>I like playing badminton, swimming, running, meditating, studying philosophy and spirituality, and traveling with my wife.</p>
