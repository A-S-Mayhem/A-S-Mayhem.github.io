Education
======
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  * Ph.D. Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 2022
  * M.Sc. Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 2018
* The Citadel, Military College of South Carolina
  * B.Sc. Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 2015

Research experience
======
**September 2015 - May 2022: Graduate Research Assistant at MIT Lincoln Laboratory - Lexington, MA** 
  * Developed a high-fidelity and entirely non-optical readout technique for solid-state spins. Applied technique to vector magnetometry using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Published in peer-reviewed journal.
  * Designed, fabricated and tested microwave (MW) spin control for MITLL Mobile Diamond Magnetometer platform.
  * Developed a broadband loop gap resonator for ultra-homogeneous MW delivery for NV-based ensemble magnetometers and fluorescence microscopes. Published result in peer-reviewed journal.
  * Built widefield and scanning confocal fluorescence microscopes to facilitate rapid iteration of MITLL diamond growth efforts. Developed custom GPU-powered control software using CUDA, MATLAB and LabVIEW.

Professional experience
======
**April 2022 - Present: Quantum Engineer at Quantum Brilliance GmbH - Stuttgart, Germany**
  * Project lead of a >10m â‚¬ multi-national Horizon Europe funded project (SPINUS).
  * Led multiple projects including the development of integrated microstructures for the selective addressing and coherent manipulation of entangled spin qubits in diamond.
  * Lateral leadership of the Nanofabrication and Device Design team, successfully managing a diverse group of three team members. Onboarded and mentored new team members and played a pivotal role in the recruitment and staffing of open engineering positions.
  * Designed and commissioned state-of-the-art widefield fluorescence microscope for the characterization of diamond-integrated control structures. 
  * Played a key role in the development of integrated control electronics, including microwave synthesizers and amplifiers. Actively contributed to multiple invention disclosures and the patent filings. 
  * Fabricated nano- and microstructures on diamond in a state-of-the-art cleanroom environment. Contributed to the establishing of electron-beam and optical lithography processes on extremely small and challenging substrates.
  * Represented the company at various high-profile conferences and trade shows, enhancing Quantum Brilliance's outreach and strengthening relationships with external partners and customers.

**June 2014 - August 2014: Engineering Intern at Northrop Grumman Synoptics - Charlotte, NC**
  * Assisted technical staff in modernizing operator control of laser crystal growth stations.
  * Developed remote human-machine interface for facility emergency power generators.

**Feb 2009 - October 2015: Loadmaster at United States Air Force Reserve - Charleston, SC**
  * Participated and took leading roles in aircrew combat operations supporting Operation Enduring Freedom in both Afghanistan and Iraq.
  * Flew 1000 operational hours in C-17 Globemaster III.
