**Note:** This webpage is a result of me trying to get ChatGPT to do clerical jobs for me, i.e., embed links to a predefined list of papers for my reading seminar. It failed. And so I hope it goes without saying that this is not me endorsing ChatGPT's application for this task. Here's the 'hand-curated version': https://indiiigo.github.io/mrb/
