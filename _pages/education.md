<h3>Thesis: Modeling Peripheral Vision in Rodents</h3>
My master's thesis delves deeply into the intriguing realm of visual perception, specifically focusing on the coding of peripheral vision in rodents as compared to the foveal vision observed in primates. Through a comprehensive analysis of the information flow within the visual pathways of rodents, I am endeavoring to formulate a groundbreaking model that can decode peripheral visionâ€”a contrast to the established primate models. To achieve this, I conducted extensive experiments where rats were exposed to natural scenes multiple times, and my analysis is based on the collective data gathered from these rat populations. This research represents a significant step towards unraveling the mysteries of peripheral vision coding, with the potential to enhance our understanding of visual perception across species.

<h3>Thesis: Design and Implementation of an Desktop Eye Tracking System</h3>
For my bachelor's thesis, I undertook the challenging task of designing and implementing a desktop-mounted eye tracking system. This project involved meticulous design work using SolidWorks and the manufacturing of components through 3D printing. On the software side, I developed the application's backend using C++, which seamlessly integrated with the powerful psychophysics framework, PsychoPy, and Python. The primary objective of this endeavor was to create a robust eye tracking system characterized by exceptional spatial resolution and a high sample rate. The system delivered outstanding results, boasting an impressive spatial resolution accuracy of less than 0.5 visual angle, combined with a remarkable sample rate of 500 Hz. This achievement represents a significant milestone in the pursuit of precise eye tracking technology and its potential applications in various fields.
