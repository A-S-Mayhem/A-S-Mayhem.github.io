1. Replicate "Rethinking ..." for sequence labeling and multi-labeling tasks
2. Explore self-supervision or weak-supervision on graphs (can you use the graph structure/subspaces effectively to improve on highly imbalanced problems?)
3. Explore methods discussed in this class for medical datasets (rare diseases etc)
4. Benchmark out of distribution detection methods (create a tooklit with common evaluation framework and several SoTA OoD methods. Can you provide some insights?)
5. Study whether any of these methods help in transfer learning between languages with different syntax (e.g., left-to-right and right-to-left languages). Make sure to see the effect with and without the use of bidirectional models such as biLSTM.
6. Cross-modal pseudolabeling on social network data
