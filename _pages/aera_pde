excerpt: "A response to Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, in which his work is applied to a personal vignette of experimentation practices in a High School Physics class.  When in the course of scientific education should students be allowed to modify scientific theories to fit experimental data instead of modifying experiments to fit the theories?"

This study aims to identify teacher practices during group work that support high-quality productive disciplinary engagement (PDE). We extend research by investigating how teachers’ practices influence group engagement dynamics in interactions. Raters applied quality ratings to 79 videos, with multiple 2.5 minute segments, of middle schoolers’ math and science collaborative group activity, and classified teacher practices, using our PDE rubrics. Analyses explored the influence of teacher practice for elevating or constraining engagement-quality over time. Two cases showcase that teacher practices had short-term, and direct corresponding influence, on groups’ PDE quality. Findings point to potential fragility of collaborative and disciplinary engagement during initial efforts, 
recommending future research investigate group engagement shifting to fully instantiating norms supported by teacher practice.
