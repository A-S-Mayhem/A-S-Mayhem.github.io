## Single-sided subduction (SSS): High trench retreat rate & back-arc extension

Models can self-consistently generate a variety of trench retreat rate and induce different extent of extension within a homogeneous and mobile overriding plate.
This is achieved by verying merely the age/thickness of the subducting slab and overriding plate under a well-constrained rheology setup.
