# Research profile

I have been PI for a one-year national project studying attitudes towards interest groups (AGAUR 2018) and I have co-led the fieldwork for three European research projects polling political organizations, designing, and implementing laboratory and survey experiments, doing automated text analysis of news articles, and surveying demonstrators. In these projects I was responsible for the production, collection, management and analysis of social media and spatial data. My research has been oriented to provide innovative theoretical and empirical analysis on collective action, especially looking into social movements and interest group organizations with a focus on outcomes, actions, and public perceptions towards them. I have combined these with research on representation, focusing on political representatives and the interaction of legislative agendas and social organizations. As a post-doctoral fellow at Science Po, I focused on the study of parliamentary behaviour by looking into the linguistic style of MPs in parliamentary interventions as a measure of inequalities in substantive representation. My independent research program is inspired by both my graduate and postdoctoral studies and investigates topics at the interface of policy and representation studies with a focus on inequalities and a comparative approach between actors, institutions and arenas. I am currently expanding my research in Europe to the Latin America context, focusing on policy dynamics, elite behaviour and political organisations (Comparative Agendas Project Latin America). A major aspect of my program is the emphasis on linguistic methods to access public discourse in political text as a starting point to study policy dynamics and representation inequalities.
