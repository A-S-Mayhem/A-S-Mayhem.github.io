## Indonesian Throughflow

The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) is a series of ocean passageways by which tropical Pacific waters flow into the Indian Ocean. Because the ITF transports a significant magnitude of heat and freshwater between the two basins, it plays a critical role in Indo-Pacific climate variablity. I utilize eddy-resolving ocean general circluation models (OGCMs) and marine sediment archives to clarify ITF dynamics on decadal-centennial timescales.

## Southeast Asia Rainfall Extremes

Throughout the last millennium, Southeast Asia experienced periods of extended drought and frequent flooding associated with extreme variations in monsoonal rainfall. These rainfall extremes contributed to historic events such as the Khmer Empire's abandonment of Angkor (15th century) and the collapse of the Ming Dynasty in China (17th century). I apply commonly-used extreme value theory methods to ensemble climate model simulations (CESM-LME) in order to quantify the various drivers of multi-year SEA rainfall extremes.

## Walker Circulation Interactions

Overlying the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans (Indo-Pacific) are the large-scale atmospheric circulation features known as the Pacific Ocean Walker Circulation (PWC) and the Indian Ocean Walker Circulation (IWC). These circulation systems are critical for transporting moisture in the tropical atmosphere and for maintaining zonal gradients in sea surface temperature (SST) and thermocline depth. My research aims to understand PWC and IWC interactions on multi-decadal to centennial timescales by reconstructing the two Walker Circulations using tropical Indo-Pacific archives and various reconstruction methods.

## Tropical Rainbelt Width

The tropical rainbelt (TRB) is an equatorial band of heavy rainfall which serves as the ascending limb of the Hadley Circulation. Historically, hydroclimate proxies were interpreted to solely reflect TRB drift/migration in response to climate forcings. However in recent years, studies have found evidence that the TRB also exhibits expansion and contraction. Using a pair of stalagmites on the margins of the Indo-Pacific TRB, we find evidence of TRB expansion and contraction over the last millennium. Furthermore, using models and additional proxy archives we identify a dynamical framework for the driver of TRB width variations.

## Glacial Termination

My past research focused on geochemical analysis of marine sediment cores from the Southern Ocean, tropical Atlantic, and subpolar North Atlantic in order to interpret ocean circulation changes across glacial terminations. I analyzed the elemental and isotopic composition of the marine sediments as well as the microfossils within the sediments (foraminifera), which led to important insights into ocean circulation and heat-uptake changes during deglacial periods.
