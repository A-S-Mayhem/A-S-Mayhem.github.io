  <b> Main Projects </b>
  <br>
  1. Computational neurethological basis of primate touch: brief description with impact...
  <br>
  2. Neural correlates of natural social primate behavior: a state-of-the-art project combining wireless neurophysiology and deep learning-based computer vision to characterize the neural mechanisms underlying rhesus macaque social behavior.

3. [_MacSuite_]("https://felipe-parodi.github.io//macsuite/"): my passion project for bringing computational tools to primatologists within and beyond the lab
<br>
4. RL for animal behavior: RL agents can help us understand... i previously explored imitation learning using "expert" human gait data to teach agents to walk from scratch. the last 1/3 of my phd will be devoted to exploring the potential of IRL to model social primate behavior
