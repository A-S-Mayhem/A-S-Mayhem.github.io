Presidential and Government agendas in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic in Latin America
======
* with Felipe Brasil (Universidade de São Paulo - EACH/USP)

The Covid pandemic has been an unexpected shock and has involved a surprising and transformative change in public agendas worldwide. This paper describes how the traditional patterns of issue competition have been disrupted to a different extent in four Latin American countries between 2018 and 2021 by the Covid-19 pandemic. Tweets from presidential and ministries ‘official users were coded issue the Comparative Agendas Project in order to compare Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Mexico during their last legislature. We describe how attention has been allocated to the Covid pandemic and how it has interacted with other issues in the presidential agendas. This is crucial in the Latin American context as the presidential agenda largely guides the attention dynamics of the parliamentary and media agendas. Changes in the core issues of the agenda has important implications for developing countries in which attending poverty relief and precarious livelihoods depend on the continual attention of policy makers."

"Talking Like a Man": Critical Mass Theory and speech style in European parliaments
======
* with Emiliano Grossman (Sciences Po, Centre d'études européennes)

How has the growing share of female representatives affected parliamentary life? Research on gender and parliamentary representation has generated contradictory results. We argue that that much past research has adopted a too static view of gender effects. We argue that the effect of female representation on parliamentary work will vary with the share of female representatives. We revisit the “critical mass” thesis, testing it on an original measure of aggregate linguistic styles by gender. Research has suggested that female politicians conform to masculine communication styles to fit in. This strategic use of speech styles has important implications for the attribution of power and status positions of female MPs and may have undesirable effects on the diffusion of gender inequalities. We examine oral questions in the parliaments of Spain France and Italy in the last three decades to tap linguistic style convergence. Data on issues from the Comparative Agendas Project is used to explore differences in language convergence as a product of specific issues. We show that women converge towards men’s speech styles, when there is very few of them. As female representation increases, speech styles grow more different. As men and women approach equal representation differences diminish again.

Tweets versus Oral Questions: Comparing Female MPs Issue Attention in the Parliamentary arena and social media
======
* with Laura Chaqués (Universitat de Barcelona and IBEI)

To what extent does social media reinforce existing power arrangements of traditional political institutions, or by the contrary, creates a new scenario in which existing inequalities in parliamentary politics are reduced? We compare MPs issue attention in the parliamentary arena and the social media in France, Italy and Spain and explain how MPs prioritize issues in two different institutional settings and explore the prevalence of gendered issues. Following existing research on agenda setting, descriptive representation and legislative careers, we argue that female MPs tend to occupy a marginal position in the political debate of a large set of issues in the parliamentary arena, especially those issues that are more rewarding in political terms and the less gendered issues. In contrast, female issue attention in the social media is more diverse and linked to public opinion trends. These results apply regardless of the political party and the level of seniority. We use data from MPs in Spain between 2011 and 2021 comprising oral questions, tweets by MPs and data on parties, parliaments and the demographic features of MPs."
