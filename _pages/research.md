## X-ray Evolution of a Relativistic Outflow and X-ray Corona in the Extreme Changing-Look AGN 1ES 1927+654

1ES 1927+654 is an AGN like no other. This system underwent a "changing-look" event in 2018, where broad emission lines appeared in its optical spectrum (see [Trakhtenbrot+19](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...883...94T/abstract)). However, the peculiarities of 1ES 1927+654 are most prominent in the X-ray part of the spectrum--1ES 1927+654 is the first known AGN where we've witnessed the destruction of the X-ray corona and the disappearance of the ubiquitous power law component of the X-ray spectrum (see [Ricci+20](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898L...1R/abstract)). This unique X-ray behavior prompted a massive X-ray follow-up campaign, including over 500 NICER observations and 7 simultaneous XMM-Newton/NuSTAR observations. We analyzed the X-ray spectral evolution over the entire outburst, and found that, despite the extreme changes to the X-ray spectrum initially, the X-ray spectrum returned to its pre-outburst state is just 3 years! In addition, we provided a new physical model for a mysterious, broad 1 keV line that was extremely prominent in the early X-ray spectra. This model, called xillverTDE, is a thermal reflection model for a single-temperature blackbody irradiating spectrum. We are now working to apply this same model to other super-Eddington accretors that show fast outflow features in their X-ray spectra. You can find our latest paper on this fascinating system [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220605140M/abstract).
