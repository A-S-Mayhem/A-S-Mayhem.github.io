I am currently developing a new distance indicator, the J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) method, for use in a cosmic distance ladder to measure the Hubble constant to high precision and accuracy. I also am actively doing research on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance indicator method. I have broad research interests in cosmic distance ladders, intermediate-age stars, stellar populations, and the expansion rate of the universe.
