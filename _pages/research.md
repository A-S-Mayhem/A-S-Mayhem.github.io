## Past Projects

### Beyond the Black Box: Understanding & Designing for Users’ Expectations of Algorithms
* **January 2018 – May 2019 : Beyond the Black Box Research Team Member**	
  * Advisors: [Karrie Karahalios](http://social.cs.uiuc.edu/people/karriekarahalios.html) (UIUC), [Christian Sandvig](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csandvig/) (UMich)
  * (Penny's text: I helped design a nationally-representative survey to understand people’s understandings and expectations of algorithms, particularly on social media platforms.)
  * Worked with a team across multiple universities to conduct a large-scale study on algorithmic literacy and awareness.

  * Worked with a team to develop [Knoxcraft](https://github.com/knoxcraft), a system that allows students to use Java/Python code to build structures in the game Minecraft.

###  Collaborative Research: Responding to Manycore: Teaching parallel computing with higher-level languages and activity-based laboratories
* https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1044299
* **Summer 2014: Research Assistant**	
  * Knox College, Galesburg, IL
  * Advisor: [David Bunde](http://faculty.knox.edu/dbunde/)
  * Worked with a team to develop materials to help teach parallel programming at Knox and other institutions.

### Task Mapping for Emerging Network Topologies
* http://faculty.knox.edu/dbunde/emergingTopo.html
* https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1423413
* (David text: This project aims to improve the performance of large scientific simulations on next-generation high-performance computing (HPC) systems by developing new strategies for task mapping, the assignment of specific parts of an application to each of the many processing nodes in an HPC system. The specific network topology studied is Dragonfly, two variations of which are used in commercial systems. By improving application performance on next-generation HPC systems, the project will help realize the full potential of these powerful systems.)
* **Summer 2013: Research Assistant**
  * Knox College, Galesburg, IL
  * Advisor: [David Bunde](http://faculty.knox.edu/dbunde/)
  * Worked with a team to investigate task mapping and cabling methods for the Dragonfly interconnect topology.
  
### The History and Construction of Elizabethan English Costume
_Spring 2013, Spring 2016: Independent Study_
_Advisor: [Margo Shively](http://knoxtheatre.org/people/Margo_Shively)_
  
In an independent research project bookending my time at Knox, I researched the dress of English women of the 1560s-70s, from both the working- and upper-classes. This research took the form of examining both primary sources (mostly art) and the work of costume scholars such as Janet Arnold, Margo Anderson, and Drea Leed. I then used the knowledge I had gained to design and construct an outfit representative of each class, consisting of garments from the skin out. The techniques and materials used were as historically accurate as I could afford. This project offered an extraordinary opportunity to step into the shoes (in a nearly literal sense) of the subjects of Elizabethan portraits, and taught me skills I still use in my creative.
