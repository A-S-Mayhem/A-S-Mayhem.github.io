## X-ray Nuclear Transients & Extreme Accretion Physics 
--- 
X-ray nuclear transients are a broad class of astronomical objects which have highly variable (and often temporary) X-ray emission. They often also show variable/transient emission in other wavelength bands too, like optical, infrared, and radio! These exciting objects allow us astronomers to probe extreme accretion physics around supermassive black holes.
