I have had the opportunity to work on a number of interesting research projects during my Ph.D. My research combines system design, signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning methods to investigate security and privacy threats on emerging computing platforms and then proposes methods for securing modern mobile and IoT devices and protecting usersâ€™ privacy. My research has shown multiple new privacy leakages resulting from sensor data available on mobile devices, introduced secure and usable authentication mechanisms for mobile users and IoT devices, proposed usable authorization protocols for mobile developers, demonstrated attacks and defenses against IoT anomaly detection systems, and built secure communication system between humans and cameras through mobile devices. Here is a summary of some of my efforts.
