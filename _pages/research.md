    title: <center>Future Heatwaves</center>
    excerpt: 'There will be more frequent, longer and more severe heatwavs in the future around the world, in linw with GHG increases and air pollution clean up. The CESM model indicates that major changes in anthropogenic aerosols over the coming century are likely to have significant impacts on future heatwaves through their indirect effects. However, there still are large uncertainties in our understanding of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions. This leads aerosol-cloud interaction parametrization to diverse largely across climate models, making the largest contribution to uncertainties in modeled radiative forcing. Given the consequences of projected changes in heatwaves for society, improving uncertainties in aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions will be critically important for future climate risk projections and management.'

    alt: "precipitation"
    title: <center>Precipitation Extremes</center>
    excerpt: 'The Asian monsoon region would become progressively warmer and wetter in the future under RCP8.5, while precipitation extremes will be significantly aggravated due to anthropogenic aerosol mitigation, particularly over East Asia. Sensitivities of changes in precipitation mean and extremes to local warming from aerosol reductions are much larger than that from greenhouse gas increases.HOwever, these projections have large uncertainties, related to poorly constrained model representations of certain processes, with different mechanisms operating in different regions. Given the consequences of these projected changes for society, constraining these uncertainties will be crucially important. Therefore, careful studies on the interactions between future Asian aerosol emissions trajectories and regional to large-scale climate dynamics are critical for effective climate risk management in this highly populated and vulnerable region.'

    alt: "Cyclone"
    title: <center>TC Surface Winds</center>
    excerpt: "We developed methods to detect the center location of tropical cyclones (TCs) as well as models for Tropical cyclone Cyclone intensity estimation and surface structure extraction using satelliete infrared imageries. We also investigate the applifcation of satellite scatterometer in estimating tropical cyclone winds.Several papers were published related to this study and formed my Master's thesis."
