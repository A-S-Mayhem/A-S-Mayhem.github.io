My research interestes lie (mainly) in the field of theoretical cosmology. In particular I am working with the Cosmic Microwave Background, its secondary anisotropies, and large scale cosmic structure to understand fundamental physics such as dark matter, neutrinos and the expansion of the Universe.

### Testing structure formation using cross-correlation of ACT lensing with the unWISE galaxy survey
Using reconstructions of the gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Bakcground (CMB) from observations made with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and surveys of the galaxy distributions from the unWISE survey we probe the amplitude of structure growth in the universe.
