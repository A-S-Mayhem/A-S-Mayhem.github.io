Since 2009, I have been developing autonomous and provable techniques for securing the information environment. This means building and configuring systems that are secure by design, not just addressing problems when they strike. By leveraging tools from graph theory, game theory and AI/ML we build practical solutions that help human operators deal with the complexity, fast-paced and deceptive nature of the cyber environments. Our research program is supported by multiple grants from Defence and the Australian Research Council - current projects are shown below.
