The JAGB Method
======
(../images/jagb.png)

Measuring the Hubble constant, precisely and accurately, has remained a challenging problem in astronomy. H0 parameterizes the current expansion rate of the universe, and together with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, provides a powerful constraint on the standard model of cosmology. 
Because of its significance, the value of H0 has undergone intense scrutiny and re-determination over the past few decades. Currently, early universe measurements of H0 inferred from the measurements of the power spectra of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB appear to differ by 4-6 sigma from measurements directly measured by late-time universe distance ladders.  These discrepancies lead to the following questions: Are the systematic errors of individual measurements causing the Hubble tension, or do we need to reform the standard Î›CDM physics model so that early-time predictions and late-time observations of H0 converge? 

I am currently developing a new distance indicator, the J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) method, for use in a cosmic distance ladder to measure the Hubble constant to high precision and accuracy. A new and independent measurement of H0 via the JAGB method may help shed light on the Hubble tension.

In my latest paper, [Lee et al. (2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abd253), I led a project to measure the distance to the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte Galaxy using four different methods: the recently developed JAGB method, the near-infrared TRGB, the optical TRGB, and Cepheids. This is the first study comparing all four methods. I showed that the JAGB method is competitive with other local distance indicators in accuracy and precision.
