### Disentangling Pivotality and Campaign Mobilization in U.S. Presidential Elections  
**Luke Miller**  
This paper develops and estimates a structural model of turnout that integrates two key forces: pivotal voting incentives and campaign-driven mobilization. Candidates strategically allocate campaign effort to maximize their probability of winning the Electoral College, anticipating that voters respond to both mobilization and competitiveness. The model is estimated using county-level data from the 2008â€“2020 U.S. presidential elections. Counterfactuals show that pivotality explains roughly 25% of the turnout gap between battleground and non-battleground states, while mobilization accounts for the remaining 75%. The model reconciles modest experimental treatment effects with large-scale campaign spending by showing that low marginal returns can coexist with low average costs per vote.

## Other Research

### From Local Election Laws to National Campaigns: The Impact of Voting Costs on Turnout  
**Luke Miller**  
Explores how local variation in voting costsâ€”driven by laws like voter ID requirements and early voting restrictionsâ€”affects national campaign strategy. Focuses the structural model of turnout on how campaign effort responds endogenously to institutional constraints. Preliminary results suggest that voting restrictions in key states reshape the equilibrium allocation of campaign resources and attenuate overall turnout effects.

### Why People Vote: Comparing Models of Voter Turnout  
**With Maxime Cugnon de SÃ©vricourt**  
Estimates and compares leading theoretical models of turnout using U.S. House and state legislative special elections. Models include pivotal voting, group-based models, and follow-the-leader strategies. Using gradient-based Maximum Likelihood Estimation and formal model comparison tests (Vuong, Clarke), we find that the best-performing model emphasizes pivotalityâ€”voters are most responsive to their perceived influence on the outcome.

### Tempting FAIT: Flexible Average Inflation Targeting and the Post-COVID U.S. Inflation Surge  
**With Roberto Duncan and Enrique MartÃ­nez GarcÃ­a**  
Estimates the causal effect of the Federal Reserveâ€™s adoption of Flexible Average Inflation Targeting (FAIT) in August 2020 using synthetic control methods. Results suggest FAIT raised observed CPI inflation by about 1 percentage point and core CPI by 0.3â€“0.4 percentage points. Results are robust to alternative specifications and placebo tests.
