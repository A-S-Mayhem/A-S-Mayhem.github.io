## Indonesian Throughflow

The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) is a series of ocean passageways by which tropical Pacific waters flow into the Indian Ocean. Because of the large magnitude of waters that flows through the ITF (15 Sv on average), it plays an important role in Indo-Pacific heat and freshwater distribution as well as regional climate. I utilizes earth system models of varying complexity as well as marine sediment archives to understand the long-term variability of the ITF (on decadal-centennial timescales) as well as the dynamical drivers of variability through key ITF passageways such as the Makassar Strait.

## Southeast Asia Rainfall Extremes

Throughout the last millennium, Southeast Asia experienced periods of drought and frequent flooding associated with extreme variations in rainfall. These rainfall extremes had a profound impact on the societies of Southeast Asia, at least partially contributing to historic events such as the Khmer Empire's abandonment of Angkor (15th century) and the collapse of the Ming Dynasty in China (17th century). 

## Glacial Terminations

During the Quaternary period (2.6 Ma to present), Earth's climate transitioned between glacial periods with expansive Northern Hemisphere ice-sheets and warmer interglacial intervals when these ice-sheets retreated.
