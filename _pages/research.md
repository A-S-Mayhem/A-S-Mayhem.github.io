## Nuclear Transients & Extreme Accretion Physics 
 
Nuclear transients are a broad class of astronomical transients which occur in the nuclei of galaxies and are associated with transient accretion episodes onto supermassive black holes. They often have highly variable emission in many different wavelength bands, including X-ray, optical, infrared, and radio! These exciting objects allow us astronomers to probe extreme accretion physics around supermassive black holes.

### Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs)

When an unfortunate star wanders just a little too close to a supermassive black hole, the tidal forces of the black hole can exceed the star's self-gravity, leading to the star being torn apart and becoming an afternoon snack for a previously quiescent black hole. This leads to a flare of electromagnetic emission across a variety of wavelengths, allowing us to study these previously invisible supermassive black holes. Currently the field of TDE populations is exploding, thanks to cadenced all-sky surveys in the optical, infrared, and X-ray. I'm very interested in the wealth of different observed properties of TDEs -- for example, many optically-selected TDEs show no X-ray emission, or show very delayed X-ray emission. Understanding this dichotomy can help us probe the physical emission mechanisms; does optical emission arise from stream-stream collisiions, or the reprocessing of X-ray emission from the accretion disk?

In addition, I'm interested in understanding our observational biases in the detection of TDEs. To assess potential biases in the optical and X-ray selection methods, I'm currently working on a sample of infrared-selected TDEs from the WISE satellite. This sample should help us understand if the over-representation of TDEs in green valley galaxies is the result of an observational bias (e.g. dust obscuration) or something more intrinsic (e.g. increased TDE rates due to merging systems). This work will also provide a more accurate estimate of the TDE rates and help reconcile observatoins and theory.
