## Past Projects

### Beyond the Black Box: Understanding & Designing for Users’ Expectations of Algorithms
* **January 2018 – May 2019 : Beyond the Black Box Research Team Member**	
  * Advisors: [Karrie Karahalios](http://social.cs.uiuc.edu/people/karriekarahalios.html) (UIUC), [Christian Sandvig](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csandvig/) (UMich)
  * (Penny's text: I helped design a nationally-representative survey to understand people’s understandings and expectations of algorithms, particularly on social media platforms.)
  * Worked with a team across multiple universities to conduct a large-scale study on algorithmic literacy and awareness.

### Knoxcraft
* **Summer 2015: Research Assistant**	
  * Knox College, Galesburg, IL
  * Advisor: [Jaime Spacco](https://www.knox.edu/academics/majors-and-minors/computer-science/faculty/spacco-jaime)
  * Worked with a team to develop [Knoxcraft](https://github.com/knoxcraft), a system that allows students to use Java/Python code to build structures in the game Minecraft.

###  Collaborative Research: Responding to Manycore: Teaching parallel computing with higher-level languages and activity-based laboratories
* https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1044299
* **Summer 2014: Research Assistant**	
  * Knox College, Galesburg, IL
  * Advisor: [David Bunde](http://faculty.knox.edu/dbunde/)
  * Worked with a team to develop materials to help teach parallel programming at Knox and other institutions.

### Task Mapping for Emerging Network Topologies
* http://faculty.knox.edu/dbunde/emergingTopo.html
* https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1423413
* (David text: This project aims to improve the performance of large scientific simulations on next-generation high-performance computing (HPC) systems by developing new strategies for task mapping, the assignment of specific parts of an application to each of the many processing nodes in an HPC system. The specific network topology studied is Dragonfly, two variations of which are used in commercial systems. By improving application performance on next-generation HPC systems, the project will help realize the full potential of these powerful systems.)
* **Summer 2013: Research Assistant**
  * Knox College, Galesburg, IL
  * Advisor: [David Bunde](http://faculty.knox.edu/dbunde/)
  * Worked with a team to investigate task mapping and cabling methods for the Dragonfly interconnect topology.
  
### The History and Construction of Elizabethan English Costume
* **Spring 2016: Independent Study**
  * Knox College, Galesburg, IL
  * Advisor: [Margo Shively](http://knoxtheatre.org/people/Margo_Shively)
  * Researched the everyday dress of Elizabethan English working-class women of the 1560s-70s and built outfit from the skin out using historically accurate techniques and materials.

* **Spring 2013: Independent Study**
  * Knox College, Galesburg, IL
  * Advisor: [Margo Shively](http://knoxtheatre.org/people/Margo_Shively)
  * Researched the court dress of Elizabethan English noblewomen of the 1560s-70s and built outfit from the skin out using historically accurate techniques and materials.
