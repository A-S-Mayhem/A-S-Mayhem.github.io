## Social rejection’s influence on memory retrieval and memory integration

For my undergraduate senior honors thesis, I investigated social rejection's influence on memory integration using Cyberball and a memory inference task. 
See below for the abstract excerpt from my thesis and a poster I presented at an undergraduate conference. 
### Abstract

It has been established that social rejection impacts people’s emotions, behaviors, and higher order cognition. Still, there is a lack of research exploring social rejection’s effect on memory. I hypothesize that rejection may specifically impair memory retrieval; however, it may be the case that social information will be prioritized over non-social information in memory, therefore improving retrieval. Furthermore, memory integration, a process that relies on retrieval, may be affected because of rejection’s effect on retrieval. This thesis reviews the current literature involving social rejection and memory and investigates social rejection’s effect on episodic memory processes, such as memory retrieval and, for the first time, memory integration. Participants (n=35) were socially rejected or accepted using Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game, and completed the Associative Inference task, a memory task in which participants encode and retrieve picture pairs to determine the effect of rejection on specific memory processes. Despite evidence that the social rejection manipulation was effective, there appears to be no effect of rejection on memory processes. Although social phenomena, such as social rejection, have been commonly researched in isolation of memory, in real life, these social phenomena and the activation of memory processes occur simultaneously and mutually influence each other.
