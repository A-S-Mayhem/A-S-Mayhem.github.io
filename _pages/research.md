## Organizational Behavior
My current research uses computational, statistical and network methods to study shareholder and stakeholder activism against corporate political activities and its influence.

Is U.S. business community united, divided, or neither? Is corporate political spending an agency problem that reflects managers' political ideology or a political investment? My dissertation will contribute to these debates. Specifically, I will address three sets of research questions: 1) Why some U.S. corporations are more likely than others to be targeted by shareholder and stakeholder activism? 2) How do firms respond to shareholder activism targeting corporate political spending activities and governance practices (i.e., the results of shareholder resolutions, disclosure and restriction of political spending, board oversight, etc.)? 3) What are the consequences of those shareholder and stakeholder activism regarding corporate status and performance (i.e., stock price, investor perceptions, federal contracts, and corporate hearing presence)?

Another extended project examines the antecedents and consequences of shareholder activism in China.

## Demography
### Cohabitation and Divorce in China
The sexual revolution movements since 1980 have shaped the life-course of individuals in China. The topic of this research specifically focused on the emerging trend of cohabitation in contemporary China, which carries important consequences for how family life is structured in the country. Following feminist movements in the Western world, the sexual revolution movement in China successfully lobbied for non-traditional ideals regarding family-life and effectively reshaped the subjective meaning of intimate relationships for younger individuals. Additional work in progress goes further to explore how these subjective meanings were transformed in recent years.

### School Desegregation and Resegregation
How do the U.S. school segregation and desegregation trends vary?
School segregation can be understood in light of movement-countermovement dynamics that reflect the development of the U.S. civil rights movement and the subsequent reactionary responses to it.

## Big Data and Computational Methods
How can social scientists use computational methods to study social phenomena? How can computational methods such as topic modeling and machine learning contribute to our field?
