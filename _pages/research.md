## Pre-PhD 
* **[Insurer Competition in the Age of Provider Consolidation](https://jaketg97.github.io/Jacob-Toner-Gosselin/files/Insurance Competition in the Age of Provider Consolidation.pdf):** My undergraduate thesis that I refined a bit post-graduation/pre-PhD. Using public data from CMS, and private data from the American Hospital Association (AHA), I tried to measure the impact of reduced healthcare provider competition on insurer competition on ACA exchanges. It is a “first go” at assessing this relationship, laying the groundwork for an eventual panel regression once there are enough years of ACA data. It adds to the literature by documenting a novel method of constructing hospital market HHI at the
county-level, and by illustrating how rating areas, a unique feature of ACA markets, allow for some control of geographic fixed effects even with limited data. Data and code can be found [here](https://github.com/jaketg97/aca_competition_consolidation).
