# Discrimination and Constraints: Evidence from The Voice (Job Market Paper)

## Abstract

Gender discrimination in the hiring process is one significant factor contributing to the poor labor market. However, there is little evidence on the extent to which gender bias by hiring managers is responsible for these disparities. In this paper, I exploit a unique dataset of blind auditions of The Voice television show as an experiment to identify own gender bias in the selection process. The first televised stage audition, in which four noteworthy recording artists are coaches, listens to the contestants “blindly”  (chairs facing away from the stage) to avoid seeing the contestant. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, a coach (hiring person) is demonstrably exogenous with respect to the artist's gender, I find find that artists are 4.5 percentage points (11 percent) more likely to be selected when they are the recipients of an opposite-gender coach. I also utilize the machine-learning approach in Athey et al. (2018) to include heterogeneity from team gender composition, order of performance, and failure rates of the coaches. The findings offer a new perspective to enrich past research on gender discrimination, shedding light on the instances of gender bias variation by the gender of the decision maker and team gender composition.


# Revisiting Unilateral Divorce, Health, and Crime

Joint with Muhammad Salman Khalid and Morgan Stockham

## Abstract

Stevenson and Wolfers (2006) theorized that unilateral divorce laws shifted power from one party to a distribution of power across both parties in the marriage, effectively providing an application of Coasian Bargaining. Utilizing a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) difference-in-difference estimator, they find that unilateral divorce had significantly reduced suicide rates, domestic violence, and intimate homicide. Innovations in econometric theory have raised concerns regarding the use of TWFE with differential timing in the treatment variable, leading to biased estimation. We revisit Stevenson and Wolfers (2006) with more modern estimators for suicide and intimate homicide rates and utilize appropriate estimators to examine the effect of unilateral divorce laws on suicides and intimate partner homicide rates. In contrast to the original research, we do not find significant effects of unilateral divorce on suicide and intimate homicide rates when controlling for covariates.

# Pandemic Safeguards and Household Safety

Joint with G. DeAngelo, Y.Le, S.Cunningham, and R.Thornton

## Abstract

A flurry of research examined the effect of COVID-19 related shelter-in-place as well as school and day care closure orders on family violence. There is considerable variation in the data samples used in previous work, which include geographic units included in the analysis and time frames studied. Previous analyses utilizing difference-in-differences analyses often produce conflicting results. In this work we include the most comprehensive data set from the United States, which includes nearly three years of data from 30 cities, to examine the effect of COVID-19 related orders on family violence to ensure that our conclusions are not reached due data selection issues. We also improve on previous analyses by utilizing the decomposition in Bacon 2021 and the estimator in Callaway 2020 to account for the differential timing in the implementation of COVID-19 related orders. Our analysis concludes that school closure significantly increased the number of child abuse calls by 70% from the mean. We detect no effect for shelter-in-place or daycare closure orders. We also document a reversal in the direction of our main coefficient estimates when using Callaway 2020 's estimator to measure the effect of daycare closure relative to two-way fixed effect


# Effect of AI-driven Recommendation System on Worker Productivity and Service Quality 

Joint with Josie Xiao

## Abstract
I have utilized a field experiment to answer the question of how machine learning-driven integration into call center operations impacts organizational productivity and work performance. This technological integration aims to help Community Resource Advisors (CRA) to search for referrals with less time and more accuracy. Though the tool is built to enhance search accuracy and better outcomes, one may worry about unintended consequences. Therefore, we propose a randomized control trial to understand the effectiveness of a technological nudge on work performance, superficially the work that connects the population in need to social programs. Specifically, we aim to understand the effect of implementing a smart recommendation system on the quality of work for an organization that relies on memorization, experience, and on-spot decision-making.
