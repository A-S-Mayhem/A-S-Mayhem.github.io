Fields of Interest
======
Applied Mathematics; an interdisciplinary branch of science is my active research zone. Researchers in this domain are mostly interested in investigating different natural phenomena mathematically, which includes mathematical modeling, analysis, and so on. Although I am fascinated by the study of any discipline of Applied Mathematics, with great numbers of fields within this field of science, primarily I am motivated to explore the following fields:

- Mathematical and Computational Fluid Dynamics
- Partial Differential Equations(PDEs)
- Computational Mathematics and Scientific Computing
- Mathematical Biology
- Scientific Machine Learning
