## Past Projects

### Beyond the Black Box: Understanding & Designing for Users’ Expectations of Algorithms
_January 2018 – May 2019_  	
_Advisors: [Karrie Karahalios](http://social.cs.uiuc.edu/people/karriekarahalios.html) (UIUC), [Christian Sandvig](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csandvig/) (UMich)_

Worked with a team across multiple universities to conduct a large-scale study on algorithmic literacy and awareness.
(Penny's text: I helped design a nationally-representative survey to understand people’s understandings and expectations of algorithms, particularly on social media platforms.)

### Knoxcraft: Teaching Introductory Programming with Minecraft
_Summer 2015 - March 2016_  
_Advisor: [Jaime Spacco](https://www.knox.edu/academics/majors-and-minors/computer-science/faculty/spacco-jaime)_  

Worked with a team to develop [Knoxcraft](https://github.com/knoxcraft), a system that allows students to use Java/Python code to build structures in the game Minecraft.

###  Collaborative Research: Responding to Manycore: Teaching parallel computing with higher-level languages and activity-based laboratories
_Summer 2014_	
_Advisor: [David Bunde](http://faculty.knox.edu/dbunde/)_

Worked with a team to develop materials to help teach parallel programming at Knox and other institutions.

### Task Mapping for Emerging Network Topologies
_Summer 2013: Research Assistant_  
_Advisor: [David Bunde](http://faculty.knox.edu/dbunde/)_

Worked with a team to investigate task mapping and cabling methods for the Dragonfly interconnect topology.
http://faculty.knox.edu/dbunde/emergingTopo.html
https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1423413
(David text: This project aims to improve the performance of large scientific simulations on next-generation high-performance computing (HPC) systems by developing new strategies for task mapping, the assignment of specific parts of an application to each of the many processing nodes in an HPC system. The specific network topology studied is Dragonfly, two variations of which are used in commercial systems. By improving application performance on next-generation HPC systems, the project will help realize the full potential of these powerful systems.)

### The History and Construction of Elizabethan English Costume
_Spring 2013, Spring 2016_  
_Advisor: [Margo Shively](http://knoxtheatre.org/people/Margo_Shively)_
  
In an independent research project bookending my time at Knox, I researched the dress of English women of the 1560s-70s, from both the working- and upper-classes. This research took the form of examining both primary sources (mostly art) and the work of costume scholars such as Janet Arnold, Margo Anderson, and Drea Leed. I then used the knowledge I had gained to design and construct an outfit representative of each class, consisting of garments from the skin out. The techniques and materials used were as historically accurate as I could afford. This project offered an extraordinary opportunity to step into the shoes (in a nearly literal sense) of the subjects of Elizabethan portraits, and taught me skills I still use in my creative projects.
