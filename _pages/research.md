* <b><ins>06.2020 - present:</ins></b> Undergraduate Research Assistant in KUIS AI Lab, Koç University
  * Research on learned image/video compression. Work accepted in [ICIP 2022](https://2022.ieeeicip.org/).
  * Worked on image and video compression using recurrent and fully convolutional variational auto-encoders. My projects included our work on the design of a novel bidirectional frame compression network and several implementation of recent works in the literature using PyTorch machine learning framework.
  * Supervisor: [Professor A. Murat Tekalp](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mtekalp/)

* <b><ins>06.2021 - 09.2021:</ins></b> Summer Research Assistant in KUIS AI Lab, Koç University
  * Studied style transfer and image manipulation with generative adversarial networks. 
  * Worked on implementation of “Swapping Autoencoder for Deep Image Manipulation” by [Park et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00653) and presented the work together with a demo.
  * Supervisor: [Professor Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/)
