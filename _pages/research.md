My research interests lie broadly in gravity and field theory, with a strong emphasis on formal theory. 
I am currently interested in using causality and extremal horizons as tools to identify physical effective field theories (EFTs), finding covariant actions that manifest electromagnetic duality in gravity, and exploring $T\overline{T}$ deformed theories coupled to JT gravity.

## Infrared Causality

As a field theory, GR is a non-renormalisable theory &mdash; this is source of the tension between QFT and GR. 
It indicates that one should make sense of this within the EFT framework, with the Einstein-Hilbert action being the leading contribution to the full effective action.
It is then natural to consider higher(-derivative) corrections to it &mdash; these capture the effects of generic UV completions of gravity without appealing to a particular quantum theory of gravity. 
From a phenomenological perspective this is a powerful tool to parameterise “quantum gravity” effects at low energies. 
A natural question is what constraints can be put on the space of possible EFTs.

(Relativistic) causality as a fundamental concept has a long history of putting constraints on the S-matrix. 
For non-gravitational theories, Wilson coefficients are constrained by positivity bounds, derived from imposing criteria such as unitarity, locality, and causality in the UV. 
Crucially, it has been noted that these are linked to causality (in the sense of subluminal propagation speeds) within the low-energy theory itself. 
Extending this to theories with dynamical gravity is subtle, because naïve causality is not invariant under field redefinitions involving the metric. 
Asymptotic causality, defined on asymptotically flat spacetimes with a causal Killing vector, demands the total scattering time delay be positive and does not suffer from this ambiguity. 

In work with my collaborators Claudia de Rham, Aoibheann Margalit, and Andrew J. Tolley, I propose infrared (IR) causality as the more refined notion of causality to constrain EFTs.
It takes the GR background geometry as the reference for causality and aligns with expectations from known partial UV completions such as QED on curved spacetime and positivity/S-matrix bootstrap bounds. 
Emphasis is put on the fact that it is crucial to be within the regime of validity of both the approximations used to compute the time delay and the EFT itself.

As an example, we applied this to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) operator as the prototypical EFT correction to gravity in $D \geq 5$. 
We showed that for graviton scattering in spherical symmetry the GB-term is consistent with IR causality as long as its Wilson coefficient is order unity. 
Within the semiclassical approximation, it looks like stronger bounds on the Wilson coefficients can be inferred by scattering off a larger number of sources.
We consider this possibility by studying scattering on pp-wave backgrounds (which includes successive shockwaves). 
We clarify that within the eikonal, semiclassical, and Born approximations the aforementioned tighter bounds are not possible within the regimes of validity of the respective approximations and the EFT itself.
  
## Electromagnetic Duality

An interesting qualitative feature of (linearised) gravity is its symmetry under electromagnetic duality. 
This is the invariance of the linearised equations of motion under exchanges of the linearised curvature and its dual. 
The symmetry turns out to be off-shell, which has inspired a long history of finding covariant action formulations which make this manifest.
For a long time, this closely mirrored electromagnetic duality, for which this problem was solved in recent years.

In ongoing work with Karapet Mkrtchyan, Euihun Joung, and Junggi Yoon I am studying ways to find covariant actions that make this symmetry manifest. 
The goal is to achieve the same for gravity in $D=4$ and eventually for gravity and higher-spins in higher dimensions. 
As a concession to simplicity, we are studying toy models in AdS, for which there is a close relation to spin-1 theories where manifestly dual and covariant actions are better understoodMy goal is to achieve the same for gravity in $D=4$ and eventually for gravity and higher-spins in higher dimensions. 

## TTbar Deformations

Lower-dimensional systems offer unique opportunities for studying quantum aspects of gravity. 
In ongoing work with Andrew J. Tolley, I am exploring $T\overline{T}$-deformed theories coupled to JT gravity.

Quantum aspects of $2D$ field theory and JT gravity are remarkably well-understood and serve as testing grounds for more realistic settings. 
For the latter is an example of a $2D$ dilaton-gravity model which has been of particular interest as the example for studying black hole information.
Further, $T\overline{T}$-deformations have gained particular interest in recent years, as they are solvable deformations that preserve integrability despite being irrelevant. 
It has also been understood that these are equivalent to coupling of the original theory to $2D$ massive gravity. 

The combined set-up provides an excellent playground for probing both field theory and gravity.
