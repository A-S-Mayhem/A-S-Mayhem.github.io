      <b> Abstract:</b>  How do we use existing social ties to improve the adoption of a new technology? I explore optimal network‑based targeting when the true expected benefit associated with the new technology varies at the household level. In particular, I focus on two types of targeting: targeting people central to the network and targeting based on the likelihood of adoption. I develop a theoretical framework where initially uninformed agents engage in DeGroot learning to decide whether or not to get fully informed about a new technology. Conditional on being fully informed, they then decide whether or not to adopt the new technology. The model predicts the possibility of low information equilibria where nobody will adopt the new technology even if it’s efficient for some of them to do so. This may happen when people are not optimistic about the prospect of the new technology. Targeting is needed to improve adoption in this context. My simulations suggest that the optimal targeting strategy in such a scenario relies on the underlying heterogeneity in the population. If the heterogeneity is high in terms of the applicability of the new technology, targeting based on the likelihood of adoption performs better than centrality‑based targeting. Conversely, centrality‑based targeting works better if the population is more homogeneous. I test these predictions using data from Malawi. My results show support in favor of my theoretical model. I argue that in designing targeting strategies for technology adoption we should pay particular attention to the characteristics of the population.

* “The Role of Experience in Learning for Index Insurance Products: Evidence from Rural Kenya” <b> </b> . </span>

      <b> Abstract:</b> This research focuses on understanding the role of experience in learning for index insurance products, using data from Index Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI), Kenya. More specifically, I analyze the possible heterogeneity of effects in terms of subsidy and knowledge treatment groups on both demand and knowledge for the product, separately. The final results support a model of rational behaviour, where payout experience leads to increase in both demand and learning, but disaster experience, more frequently observed in the data, leads to an increase in demand with no associated learning effect. This can explain the decreasing demand associated with the product over sales periods. With respect to the exogenous treatments, I find discount treatments to be most effective in channelling a positive learning effect from the payout experience and, argue for a policy that compliments both type of treatments to increase demand in the short and long run.
