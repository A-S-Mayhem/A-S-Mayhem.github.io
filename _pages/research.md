In my research I use a combination of lab and field experiments to explore topics that include

- misspecified social learning
- discrimination and inaccurate beliefs
- rationalization and motivated reasoning
- student mental health stigma
- tutor peer groups


## Working papers

- "Statistical Discrimination and Misspecified Learning"

- "Stigma, Beliefs and Demand for Mental Health Services Among University Students" with Ida Grigoryeva

- "The Importance of Peers in Teaching: A Peer Support Intervention on a Tutoring Platform" with Salome Aguilar Llanes, Bernardo Garcia Bulle Bueno and Ida Grigoryeva

- "Ex Post Rationalization and Motivated Beliefs"
