## Working Papers
* **[Insurer Competition in the Age of Provider Consolidation](files/Insurance Competition in the Age of Provider Consolidation.pdf):** Started as an undergraduate thesis that I've substantially overhauled post-graduation. Using public data from CMS, and private data from the American Hospital Association (AHA), I tried to measure the impact of reduced healthcare provider competition on insurer competition on ACA exchanges. It is a “first go” at assessing this relationship, laying the groundwork for an eventual panel regression once there are enough years of ACA data. It adds to the literature by documenting a novel method of constructing hospital market HHI at the
county-level, and by illustrating how rating areas, a unique feature of ACA markets, allow for some control of geographic fixed effects even with limited data.
