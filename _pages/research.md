Research interests
======
I  am  interested  in  studying  thermodynamics  in  modern  systems  by  combining  advanced  moleculartheories  and  simulation  techniques,  and  collaborating  with  experimentalists.   Some  of  my  interestsinclude:
* Self-assembly and phase transitions in soft materials such as lipids, proteins, and polymers
* Thermodynamics and transport in advanced membranes or in nanochannels
* Electrolytes or polyelectrolytes for advanced energy applications
