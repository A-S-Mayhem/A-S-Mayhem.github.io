*   [“Optimal Network-Based Targeting for Technology Adoption in Developing Countries” (Job Market Paper)](/files/pdf/Optimal Network Based Targeting for Technology Adoption in Developing Countries.pdf)
    
    How do we use existing social ties to improve the adoption of a new technology? I explore optimal network-based targeting when the expected benefit associated with
the new technology varies at the household level. In particular, I focus on two types of targeting: targeting households central to the network and targeting based on the likelihood of adoption. I develop a theoretical framework where initially uninformed agents engage in DeGroot learning to decide whether or not to get fully informed about a new technology. Conditional on being fully informed, they then decide whether or not to adopt the new technology. The model predicts the possibility of low information equilibria where nobody will adopt the new technology even if it’s efficient for some of them to do so, and targeting is needed. My simulations suggest that the optimal targeting strategy in such a scenario relies on the underlying heterogeneity in the population. If heterogeneity is high in terms of the applicability of the new technology, targeting based on the likelihood of adoption performs better than centrality-based targeting. Conversely, centrality-based targeting works better if the population is more homogeneous. I test these predictions using data from Malawi and provide evidence supporting my theoretical model. I argue that population heterogeneity in benefits from a technology matters for the success or failure of alternative targeting strategies that promote that technology.
