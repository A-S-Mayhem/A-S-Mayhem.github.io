### Heterogeneity in Sectoral Production and the Macro Effect of Sectoral Shocks
The effect of a negative shock to an individual sector on GDP depends on (1) how important that sector is as a direct and indirect supplier of other sectors, and (2) how easily sectors can substitute across intermediate inputs. Past estimates of the parameters that determine these qualities in the US have been restrictive: they have not been allowed to vary across industries or across time. This paper uses a novel empirical strategy to relax those restrictions, by exploiting variation in input expenditure share shifts within industries rather than across industries. The resulting estimates exhibit significant sectoral and temporal heterogeneity; they are also dynamically correlated with weighted patents. These estimates imply different patterns of micro-to-macro propagation relative to the previous literature. Past predictions have underestimated the GDP effect of negative shocks to sectors whose customers are less able to substitute inputs (e.g. “Chemical products”), and the GDP effect of negative shocks in years where all sectors are less able to substitute inputs (e.g. 2000-2001, 2011-2012). They have also ignored changes in the GDP effect of negative shocks due to changes in the importance of sectors as input suppliers (e.g. between 1997 and 2023 the GDP effect of “Paper products” shocks fell while the GDP effect of “Computer and electronic products” shocks rose, due to changes in their importance as inputs).

## Pre-PhD 
### [Insurer Competition in the Age of Provider Consolidation](https://jaketg97.github.io/Jacob-Toner-Gosselin/files/Insurance Competition in the Age of Provider Consolidation.pdf) 
My undergraduate thesis that I refined a bit post-graduation/pre-PhD. Using public data from CMS, and private data from the American Hospital Association (AHA), I tried to measure the impact of reduced healthcare provider competition on insurer competition on ACA exchanges. It is a “first go” at assessing this relationship, laying the groundwork for an eventual panel regression once there are enough years of ACA data. It adds to the literature by documenting a novel method of constructing hospital market HHI at the
county-level, and by illustrating how rating areas, a unique feature of ACA markets, allow for some control of geographic fixed effects even with limited data. Data and code can be found [here](https://github.com/jaketg97/aca_competition_consolidation).
