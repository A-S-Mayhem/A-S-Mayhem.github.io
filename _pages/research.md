# Genetic Interactions

The interplay between genes and environment in human disease remains unclear. I am identifying interactions between genetic factors, lifestyle factors, and medications using massive biobank datasets, with an interest in individualized genetic prediction and modifiable risk factors.

## Statistical methods for discovering interactions

## Importance of gene-environment interactions in prediction

# Immune infiltration

Infiltrating immune cells are prognostic of cancer progression and a tumor's response to treatment. By using computational approaches in genomic and transcriptomic datasets, I am evaluating immune infiltration across healthy and cancerous tissues in the human body and searching for the major factors that drive individuals' differences.

## Genetic factors influence immune infiltration

## Role of somatic variation in immune infiltration
