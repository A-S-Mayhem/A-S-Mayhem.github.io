## Research Interests

During my graduate studies, I worked with my advisor, Dr. Krystal Taylor, to answer questions at the intersection of harmonic analysis, number theory, and geometric measure theory. Our primary project was counting lattice points on surfaces (with and without vanishing curvature) utilizing techniques in harmonic analysis.

Our paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.02163), and my dissertation, Lattice Point Counting through Fractal Geometry and Stationary Phase for Surfaces with Vanishing Curvature, is available on OhioLink and ProQuest.
