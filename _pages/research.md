<br><strong>The Stakes and Informativeness Trade-Off: Electoral Incentives to Implement Programmatic Transfers.</strong> <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/722341">[Link]</a><br>
​

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 11.5pt;">If a transfers policy is programmatic (it is transparent and non-manipulable), is it irrelevant for politicians' electoral fortunes? I show that the answer is no with a political agency model where politicians' competence is uncertain to all. In my setup, an incumbent can allocate a budget to public goods and transfers. These policies differ in one key dimension: the provision of public goods fluctuates more over time relative to transfers. When the incumbent increases the budget to public goods, two effects arise: his performance in office today reveals more information about his identity (an informativeness effect), and voters' anticipation of narrow transfers tomorrow increases the salience of political selection (a stakes effect). To the incumbent, these two effects move in opposing directions and, consequently, the strategic allocation of the budget helps him to advance his electoral fortunes.</p>


<br><strong>Brains or Muscles? A Political Economy of Capital Tax Evasion</strong> (with Alberto Parmigiani). <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lizpwy9p9nzvqhd9ygoau/main-merged.pdf?rlkey=g78dl3twxmryvw613jytzxshi&dl=0">[Link]</a><br>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 11.5pt;">An affluent individual aiming to evade capital taxes may enhance his evasion strategy through investments in "brains", which involves sophisticating the evasion scheme to decrease the likelihood of a financial audit. Within our model, being audited doesn't automatically result in sanctions; instead, concrete evidence must be gathered by a tax investigator, who operates under the potential threat of retaliation from the wealthy evader, manifested through "muscles" type investments. Our analysis reveals a critical point regarding institutional quality: below a certain threshold, "brains" and "muscles" investments are positively correlated, but beyond this point, their correlation turns negative. This leads to a significant empirical prediction from our theoretical framework: the relationship between capital tax evasion estimates and the strength of institutions is inversely U-shaped. To test this hypothesis, we compiled a panel dataset covering capital tax evasion across twenty-eight countries from 2004 to 2016, providing robust support for our theoretical prediction through both parametric and non-parametric methods.</p>


<br><strong>Merchants of Reputation: Privatization under Elites' Manipulation of Information.</strong> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4112044">[Link]</a><br>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 11.5pt;">An economic elite wants to buy a public asset as cheaply as possible. Its ownership is decided by an incumbent politician who can be of high or low competence. The elite can make a buying offer for the asset and manipulate the information that is available to voters about the incumbent’s competence. By attacking the incumbent (trying to uncover bad news about his competence before making him an offer) or threatening him (with uncovering bad news if he refuses to sell), I show that the elite can reduce the prices that the incumbent would accept for selling the asset. I also show that the elite often (but not always) uses threats against a leading incumbent (one who has better reputation than his challenger) and attacks against a trailing one. I further find that a better reputation can actually render an incumbent more susceptible to the elite’s influence.</p>
