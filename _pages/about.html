  <p>
    The <strong>THRIVIN’ Group</strong> is an interdisciplinary research lab 
    based at the University of Alberta, 
    housed within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. 
    We focus on advancing the science of transportation resilience and 
    public health under climate stress, combining engineering, data science, 
    and environmental health. 
  </p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>THRIVIN’ Group</strong> investigates 
    how climate-related stressors impact transportation systems 
    and their cumulative and cascading effects on public health. 
    We use real-world transportation networks as natural experiments 
    to uncover emerging properties in complex, interdependent systems. 
    Our research focuses on 
    how environmental exposure accumulates at the trip level, 
    propagates through network interdependencies, 
    and contributes to systemic tipping points 
    across multimodal transportation infrastructures.
  </p>

  <h2>Research Question</h2>
  <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1.1rem; border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1rem;">
    How do transportation systems influence 
    sustainability, resilience, and public health at the network level?
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Our Goal</h2>
  <p>
    We aim to develop <strong>cyber-physical systems (CPS)</strong> 
    that monitor, simulate, and improve transportation network resilience and health. 
    These systems integrate human behavior, infrastructure vulnerability, 
    and real-time sensing to support decisions that reduce health risks and 
    ensure equitable, climate-adaptive mobility.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Framework</h2>
  <p>
    Our research spans multiple scales—
    from <strong>micro-level exposure accumulation</strong> 
    during individual trips, 
    <strong>meso- and network-level</strong> modeling of cascading failure,
    to <strong>macro- or multi-temporal-level</strong> discovery of tipping points. 
    Using spatiotemporal simulations, 
    we track how localized failures can trigger broader disruptions 
    and affect system-wide accessibility.
