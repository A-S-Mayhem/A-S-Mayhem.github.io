## Course Learning Goals:
1. By the end of the course, the student will understand and be able to apply the Python programming language towards performing mathematical and numerical computation.

2. By the end of the course, the student will understand and be able to apply mathematical techniques from linear algebra, differential equations, and optimization towards engineering problems.

3. By the end of the course, the student will understand and be able to apply computational techniques such as data preprocessing and visualization, dimensionality reduction and clustering, and supervised machine learning towards the data-driven modeling of chemical and engineering systems.

4. By the end of the course, the student will have had opportunities to further his or her professional development through practicing written, oral, and graphical communication skills.
