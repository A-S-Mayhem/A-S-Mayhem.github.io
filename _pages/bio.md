Dr. Scott Olesen is Group Lead for Epidemiology at Biobot Analytics, a wastewater epidemiology company whose mission is to make wastewater monitoring a permanent part of our public health infrastructure. He earned his PhD at MIT, where he studied environmental microbiology and the human microbiome, and completed postdoctoral training at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, where he focused on the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. He served as Scientific Director for OpenBiome, the fecal microbiota transplantation bank, before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he shifted to epidemiology consulting work for state and federal government, the US Navy, the National Basketball Association, and, finally, Biobot.
