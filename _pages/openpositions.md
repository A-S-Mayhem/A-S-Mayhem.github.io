**There are not currently any open positions in the Flanagan Lab. **

If you are interested in joining the research group, please read about general opportunities to [join the lab](https://flanagan-lab.github.io/people/join).


**The Flanagan lab:** My group studies how and why complex traits and behaviours evolve, with a focus on sexually selected traits. We use a number of different methods to address these broad questions: studies of relevant traits and selection on those traits; genomic studies of signatures of selection; and theoretical simulation studies. 

My lab is inclusive, welcoming, and committed to advancing diversity; I welcome everyone regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, colour, socioeconomic background, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, and age. I especially encourage members of historically underrepresented groups including (but not limited to) people of colour, women, veterans, and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities to inquire about opportunities and apply to join my group. 

**The University:** The University of Canterbury is located in Christchurch, the largest city in New Zealand's South Island. The University has approximately 13,000 students and 2,000 postgraduate students enrolled. The University's modern and well-equipped facilities are spread across a spacious suburban campus, with easy access to the city and the cultural and recreational facilities it provides. There is also good access to the scenic and recreational resources of the Southern Alps and Banks Peninsula.
