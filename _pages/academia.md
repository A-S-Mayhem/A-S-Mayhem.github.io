<!-- I have worked on exciting projects all looking to understand mantle heterogenity.

## PhD Student, University College London -->



I am a post-doctoral associate at the University of Florida in Gainesville. As a geodynamicist, I'm interested in modelling the Earth's mantle and am currently investigating how chemical structures form at the CMB. I'm also interested in understanding the mantle's interaction with the surface, with a focus on votalites and chemical heterogenity introduced at subduction zones.


Models

My [PhD thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10093095/) used parametrised convection models to investigate the deep water cycle, where water is transported between the surface and mantle interior over geological timescales. I am also a contributer to the mantle convection code [ASPECT](https://aspect.geodynamics.org/).
