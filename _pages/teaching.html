The courses I have designed and taught at the undergraduate and graduate levels can be grouped into the following three large areas: 
<ol>
  <li>cognitive science, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of (cognitive) science;</li>
  <li>history of philosophy;</li>
  <li>environmental ethics & enviromental philosophy.</li>
</ol>

Reflecting my interests and orientation as a researcher, in my teaching I like to emphasize the intersection of questions in these distinct areas. I have done this, for instance, by emphasizing the "environmental" and "ecological" dimensions of mind (area #1, connecting to #3), focusing on changing views on mind and science in my historical courses (area #2, connecting to #1), and discussing how environmental issues relate to conceptions of what humans are like and to perspectives on development in science and technology (area #3, connecting to #1 and #2).
