I have had the opportunity to contribute to the academic growth of students as a **Teaching Assistant** at **North South University**. My primary role involves teaching **CSE 225: Data Structures and Algorithms** and **CSE 215: Programming Language II (OOP)**. Here are some of my key contributions:

- **Tutorial Sessions**: Conducted multiple tutorial sessions to provide additional guidance and in-depth explanations on core course concepts, particularly in object-oriented programming and data structures. This allowed students to grasp complex topics and apply them in practical scenarios.

- **Assignment Grading and Feedback**: I graded homework assignments, ensuring thorough evaluation and providing detailed, constructive feedback to help students improve their understanding and coding skills.

- **Examination Support**: I assisted in proctoring quizzes and examinations, ensuring academic integrity and helping maintain a smooth examination process.

Through these experiences, I have developed a passion for teaching, mentorship, and fostering student engagement in technical subjects.
