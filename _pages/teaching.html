<p> I have been demonstrator for several modules during my time in Birmingham, and the experience has been quite positive for me. Transitioning from a pure mathematics backgound to a computer science department was so easy at first . Not only do these two worlds have different cultures but also they require a different set of skills and more importantly a different mindset particulary for teaching students. I had to learn both OCaml and Haskell in my first semester in B'ham since I was a demonstrator for both. Although a bit difficult to find time to learn these functional programming languages, it was a wothwhile experience as they opened my eyes to a radically different paradigm of programming; more categorical.

<p> Also, during my masters programme at Western I had a lot of TAing to do. Other than usual time-consuming Calculus and Linear Algebra teaching and helping students in help centre, I and <a href="http://www-home.math.uwo.ca/~mpinson/" target="_blank"><font color="B22222">Martin Pinsonnault</font></a> were in charge of running training sessions for Western maths team for <a href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition" target="_blank"><font color="B22222"></font></a>Putnam competition</a> in 2013 and 2014 which was quite fun. </p>
