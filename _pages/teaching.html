<p> I have been demonstrator for several modules during my time in Birmingham, and the experience has been quite positive for me. Transitioning from a pure mathematics backgound to a computer science department was so easy at first . Not only do these two worlds have different cultures but also they require a different set of skills and more importantly a different mindset particulary for teaching students. I had to learn both OCaml and Haskell in my first semester in B'ham since I was a demonstrator for both. Although a bit difficult to find time to learn these functional programming languages, it was a wothwhile experience as they opened my eyes to a radically different paradigm of programming; more categorical.
