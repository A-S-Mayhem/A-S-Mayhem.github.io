I believe that learning is a life-long endeavor. Therefore, my teaching goal is to help students develop a systematic approach to learning focused on aligning personal motivations and applying effective learning techniques. Students leaving my classroom will not only master the learning outcomes but also possess the skills to continually apply and adapt their learning in various contexts of their careers. My teaching approach is based on my past teaching and mentoring experiences and personal academic journey. As a teacher and a mentor, I aspire to meet my students where they are and guide them to develop effective, personalized learning approaches through the following methodologies:\n


1. Promote learner motivation by communicating and aligning learning goals.\n

2. Enhancing learning and developing critical thinking skills using active learning approaches.\n

3. Creating an inclusive learning environment by adopting a growth mindset.\n
