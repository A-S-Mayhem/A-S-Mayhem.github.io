I am a Machine Learning PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. Amos Storkey. I am a member of the [BayesWatch](https://www.bayeswatch.com/) research group and the Adaptive and Neural Computation (ANC) research institute. My broader research topic is 
meta-learning in deep neural networks. More specifically, I am interested in applying meta-learning to 
learn a variety of
internal network components (e.g. losses, optimizers, learning rates, architectures, memory modules, 
initializations etc.) such that a model can perform very well on a target task.
