Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). I expect to graduate in 2023. My research interests are in the areas of Development Economics and Applied Microeconomics.

My doctoral research investigates development policies that aid farmers in developing countries learn about new technologies and products. In my [job market paper](/files/pdf/Optimal Network Based Targeting for Technology Adoption in Developing Countries.pdf), I explore optimal network-based targeting for improving technology adoption with an application to the farmers in Malawi. To do so, I exploit secondary longitudinal survey data and combine reduced form, structural modeling, and network analysis to provide evidence on the learning and adoption processes of small-scale farmers. My work is directly informed by policy considerations (optimal targeting) and speaks to broader micro-development concerns in the technology adoption literature. 

My other, related, chapters address the role of experience in learning index insurance products for farmers in Kenya; and explore the effect of risk and uncertainty preferences on the adoption of uncertain technologies for Peruvian potato farmers. I am also working on understanding the impact of judicial independence in rural Bangladesh.
