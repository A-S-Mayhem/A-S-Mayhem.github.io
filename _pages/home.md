<h1> Hi, I'm Avra. </h1>

Just another curious being, deeply interested in the fields of science, politics, and current happenings in the world. On this website, you can expect to find updates on my on-going [research works](https://avratanubiswas.github.io/research/), as well as my thoughts and insights on various topics through my [blog posts](https://avratanubiswas.github.io/posts/). 

Please note that this website is currently under development. While there may not be much to see at this time, rest assured that updates and improvements are on the way. For any inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact me through my other available channels.
