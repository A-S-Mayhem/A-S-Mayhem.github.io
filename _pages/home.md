Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). I expect to graduate in 2023. My research interests are in the areas of Development Economics, Information Economics, and Applied Microeconomics.

My doctoral research investigates development policies that aid economic agents in developing countries learn about new technologies and products. In my [job market paper](/files/pdf/Network-Based Targeting with Heterogeneous Agents for Improving Technology Adoption.pdf), I explore network-based targeting for improving technology adoption with an application to the farmers in Malawi. To do so, I exploit secondary longitudinal survey data and combine reduced form, structural modeling, and network analysis to provide evidence on the learning and adoption processes of small-scale farmers. My work is directly informed by policy considerations and speaks to broader micro-development concerns in the technology adoption literature. 

My other related chapters address the role of experience in learning about index insurance products for farmers in Kenya and explore the effect of risk and uncertainty preferences on the adoption of uncertain technologies for Peruvian potato farmers.
