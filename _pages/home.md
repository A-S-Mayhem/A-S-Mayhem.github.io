Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). My research interests are in the areas of Development Economics, Applied Micro Economics, and Institutional Economics. Currently, I am working on my job market paper that focuses on using network-based targeting strategies for improving technology adoption.
