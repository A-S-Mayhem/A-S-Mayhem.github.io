<h1> Hi, I'm Avra. </h1>
Welcome to my personal website! I am just another curious being, deeply interested in the fields of science, politics, and current happenings in the world. As a PhD candidate, biophysicist, and data science enthusiast, I am constantly seeking new ways to expand my knowledge and apply it to my research. On this website, you can expect to find updates on my on-going [research works](https://avratanubiswas.github.io/research/), as well as my thoughts and insights on various topics through my [blog posts](https://avratanubiswas.github.io/posts/). My passion for open-source technology has led me to explore the world of Python, specifically the open-source web development framework Streamlit. I am also always keeping an eye on the latest advancements in the field of AI and ML, and I am excited to share my findings with you. Thank you for stopping by, and I am always happy to chat more about my work. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or comments.
