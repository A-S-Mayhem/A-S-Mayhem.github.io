**Welcome!**

I am a senior student in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department at Bilkent University. I am also a Machine Learning Researcher in [Prof.Dr.Suleyman Serdar Kozat](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/)'s research group. 

During my undergraduate studies, I have worked on **machine learning**, **data science**, **convex optimization**, and **signal processing**. Specifically, my work involves designing cutting-edge algorithms for time series, spatiotemporal prediction, and convex optimization in high-dimensional spaces. I have first authored a recently submitted journal [paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2310.17544) to the Journal of Machine Learning.
My journey through undergraduate studies and industrial experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in Machine Learning research, where I've honed my skills in exploring and analyzing distorted data, developing cutting-edge algorithms, and pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence. 

The latest version of my CV can be found [here](/files/aysintumay_cv.pdf).
