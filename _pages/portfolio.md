## Stabilising Generative Adversarial Network Training
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of Generative Models, which received wide attention for their ability to model complex real-world data. With a considerably large number of potential applications and a promise to alleviate some of the major issues of the field of Artificial Intelligence, recent years have seen rapid progress in the field of GANs. Despite the relative success, the process of training GANs remains challenging, suffering from instability issues such as mode collapse and vanishing gradients. This project aims at reviewing currently employed approaches and methods for the purpose of stabilizing GAN training procedure, as well as developing new ones drawing on methods from multi-agent learning.
