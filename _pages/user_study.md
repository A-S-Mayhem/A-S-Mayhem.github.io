We are currently conducting a research study in the field of sound for Augmented Reality (AR) and its impact on psychoacoustics. We invite you to participate in this study and contribute to our understanding of sound rendering for Mixed Reality applications. 

## Study Details: 

- **Purpose**: The study aims to investigate the impact of realistic sound rendering on tasks requiring the use of psychoacoustic abilities in AR applications. 
- **Tasks**: Participants will be required to complete two listening tasks, "localisation and masking", involving the interaction with virtual sound sources. 
- **Duration**: The total duration of the study is approximately 30 minutes per participant. 
- **Location**: The study will be conducted in STEAMHouse CST208, Birmingham City University, City Centre Campus. 

## Benefits of Participation: 

Contribute to advancing knowledge in the field of AR, sound rendering and applied psychoacoustics. 
Gain experience and discuss AR research methodologies. 

## Confidentiality and Ethical Considerations: 

All data collected is anonymised. 
Participation is voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw at any time without consequences. 
The study has been approved by the Universityâ€™s Ethics Committee; please Participant Information Leaftlet below for further details.
