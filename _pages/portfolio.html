My current research revolves around two questions: How does brain work during navigation? And how does environment influence people’s cognition?

For the first question, I research individual differences in the perception of distance, direction, and decision-making during wayfinding. Particularly, I look at neural mechanisms of travel direction system in the human brain by using psychophysics, fMRI, and computational models.

For the second question, I am curious about how biased world knowledge influence people’s cognition. As 90% of human beings are right-handed, most of man-made tools in daily life are designed for right-hand use. In other words, we live in a right-handed world. To look at how the biased world knowledge influence cognition at different spatial scales, I test left-handed and right-handed human and virtual robots in spatial tasks.

In addition, I enjoy thinking about scientific questions across spatial and temporal scales. For example, how could neuroinflammation in medial temporal lobe contribute to spatial disorientation, what are the sex differences in spatial abilities across different countries and continents, and how could we understand different navigation strategies from an evolutionary perspective (e.g., hunter-gatherer theory). I’d like to pursue a career that leverages both brain science and artificial intelligence.
