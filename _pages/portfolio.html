MIS 3353 Database Project
======

Project Summary:

The client, Sonner Tire Company, has reached out to the Quad Squad in hopes of implementing a new and updated database system. Sonner Tire has outgrown their current way of storing data and has frequently run into problems because of it. These problems include having to physically keep count of their inventory, paying for the same invoice multiple times, and not being able to track their best and worst customers. The Quad Squad has come up with a proposed database to resolve these recurring issues. We have split this project into three different phases: conceptual design, logical design, and physical design and implementation.



During the conceptual design phase, we held a client meeting to discuss Sonner Tire’s desires for their database and to clear up any confusion regarding their business processes. With this information, we made some assumptions that were integrated into the entity relation diagram (ERD) we created. Over the nearly two months we worked on this database, the ERD itself went through many changes to better adapt to Sonner Tire’s needs.



The logical design stage consisted of turning the entities we created into logical relations. We completed this phase to ensure the database would run efficiently and would be trustworthy for its users. The last phase, physical design and implementation, involved us creating the actual database in a relational database management system (RDBMS). For this database specifically, we used Microsoft SQL Server. This phase also included populating Sonner Tire’s data into the database and running queries to ensure feasibility.



Our proposed database will help Sonner Tire Company improve their efficiency dramatically. Sonner Tire’s business processes will be better controlled as well. The final cost of the project totaled $665 with approximately 25 hours put into the project collectively. Aspects that contributed to the cost include the client meeting, time dedicated to writing up the project document, and revision of the ERD across the three phases.
