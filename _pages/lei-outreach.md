<h3>EGU_GD blog editor</h3>

I am part of the EGU geodynamics (EGU_GD) early career scientists team as a blog editor. In brief, EGU_GD coordinates the scientific programme and related activities 
on all aspects of geodynamic processes in the lithosphere, mantle, and core of the Earth and the terrestrial planets. 
The division also promotes scientific interchange and dissemination of activities carried out by its members. 
The target audience of the blog ranges from students, early career scientists and senior scientists in the GD community throughout the world. 
You can find more about us in the following link. [https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/about/](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/about/)

As one of the EGU_GD blog editors, we invite guest authors to share GD news, publications, events, undergoing projects, research life, etc.
The format of the blog post can be flexible, while the length of each blog post is usually encouraged to be 1,000 words at most. All my edited EGU_GD blogs 
can be found at [https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/author/lei/](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/author/lei/).

Once the blog post is online, it will be shared on our twitter account (@EGU_GD) and Facebook account, which will help increase its exposure to the 
GD community. The EGU_GD blog post has run for over 5 years so far. And it has over 3,500-4,200 unique pageviews per month, and ~45,000 unique pageviews 
on average per year. Here are some our most recent pulished [EGU_GD blogs](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/).

If you are interested in contributing to the EGU_GD blog post to either highlight any GD news, or promote any exciting GD research output, 
feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:leiz2@cardiff.ac.uk) with the topic of "Authorship application for EGU_GD blog posts". I will create for you an author page, which is demonsted as an example below, to list all your contribution to the EGU_GD blog posts. Look forward to hearing from you!
