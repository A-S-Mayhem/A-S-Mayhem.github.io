Here are some projects that I have worked on.

## Applied Projects

- [Development Bank from the State of Minas Gerais - Brazil (BDMG)](https://www.bdmg.mg.gov.br/en/)
  - I collaborated closely with the risk team to enhance their risk analysis scorecards by integrating state-of-the-art machine learning techniques while ensuring the incorporation of fairness considerations.

- [GetNinjas](https://www.getninjas.com.br/)
  - While working with the GetNinjas pricing team for my job market paper, I engaged in discussions covering various areas such as experimentation, pricing strategies, and advertising, broadening my understanding of related challenges and opportunities in a high-growth tech company in LATAM.
 
- [Digital Lab - Americanas](www.americanas.com)
  - Before joining Columbia, I held the position of Data Scientist at Digital Lab, a research center at PUC-Rio. In this role, I worked on pricing optimization and demand forecasting methods for Lojas Americanas, a prominent Brazilian retailer boasting over 1500 stores.
