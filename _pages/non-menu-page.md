## Climate-tectonic processes

* PhD training developed my interest in investigating the interactions between climate and tectonic processes that impact the habitability and sustainability of life. It focuses on quantifying climate-tectonic interplay in shaping earth's surface and paleoenvironment using (1) geochronology, such as low-temperature thermochronology and optically stimulated luminescence dating; (2) remote sensing data; (3) multidisciplinary sedimentology, tectonics, and geomorphology approach; and (4) statistical and numerical modeling. Field expeditions include Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya (specifically in the Siang, Dibang, and Lohit river valleys), the Shillong plateau, and the Belt of Schuppen (especially in the southeastern boundary of Assam valley and the western part of Nagaland).

## Mineral-Microbe interaction

* Post-doctoral journey had hooked my attention to mineral-microbe interactions and geobiotechnology. Now exploring (1) microbe surface reaction with minerals; (2) the effect of mineral biotic and abiotic interactive processes on the structure and activities of microbial communities; and (3) biogeochemical transformation and transport of chemical and biological components at different temporal and spatial scales.
  
## Science Education Research

* My science education research involves designing research projects and conducting fieldwork for school students as a means to popularise geoscience and prepare them for careers in Earth Sciences.
