## Climate-Tectonic Interactions

* PhD training developed my interest in investigating the interactions between climate and tectonic processes that impact the habitability and sustainability of life.
* Tools used in quantifying climate-tectonic interplay include (1) geochronology, such as low-temperature thermochronology and optically stimulated luminescence dating; (2) remote sensing data; (3) multidisciplinary sedimentology, tectonics, and geomorphology approach; and (4) statistical and numerical modeling.
* Field expeditions include Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya (specifically in the Siang, Dibang, and Lohit river valleys), the Shillong plateau, and the Belt of Schuppen (especially in the southeastern boundary of Assam valley and the western part of Nagaland).

## Mineral-Microbe Interactions

* Post-doctoral journey develpoed my attention to mineral-microbe interactions and geobiotechnology. Now exploring biogeochemical transformation and transport of chemical and biological components at different temporal and spatial scales.
  
## Earth Science Education Research

* My science education research involves designing research projects and conducting fieldwork for school students as a means to popularise geoscience and prepare them for careers in Earth Sciences.
