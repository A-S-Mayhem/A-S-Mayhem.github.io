## Infographics

As a volunteer in [Economica](https://economica.pe/), I am in charge of designing infographics on topics in economics. Here you can find some of my research and designs :

* [Las Microfinanzas como herramienta para lograr el objetivo de la inclusión financiera](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaTHzh-r2yE/?igshid=NWRhNmQxMjQ=) - Revista Economica, (February 2022, Peru)
    <em>With Diana Casimiro</em>

 This infographic seeks to explain what microfinance is and how microfinance institutions are constituted in the Peruvian market. After having made these terms clear, it was found that microfinance entities concentrate the highest penetration of microcredits to MYPES in the poorest sectors of our country (14.05%) in 2020, and instead the other financial companies traditional concentrated 3.79%, which demonstrates the fundamental role of MFIs in deepening and reducing poverty in the country.

   Here, we define global public goods as those whose benefits affect all citizens of the world. Given that it involves a large number of individuals, it is essential to guarantee the supply of this type of goods and the most appropriate institution to coordinate the supply of local and national public goods is the state government. Finally, as an example of the triumphs and limitations of international coordination, the ratification of the Paris Agreement is given as an example.

    In this infographic we explain that the dollars come out of an account called international reserves, which are collected through exchange operations carried out by the Central Bank through the Negotiation Table, the purchases and sales of foreign currency to the public sector, the purchase temporary foreign currency among other operations. These reserves are used to face unexpected capital outflows and reduce the volatility of the exchange rate. They are like a guarantee that we have to prevent the dollar from skyrocketing

    The use of cash can have both advantages and disadvantages. This is why using digital money from central banks at the time of commercial transactions can be an effective alternative because it reduces the costs generated by handling cash, improves financial inclusion and encourages innovation.

As a pre-professional microfinance analysis intern at ([Superintendency of Banking, Insurance and Private Pension Fund Administrators (SBS)](https://www.sbs.gob.pe/)), I supported the creation of a Fintech document that seeks to describe this industry in the Peruvian market, as well as the perspective that the SBS has in relation to Fintech companies. This document is of vital importance, since the regulations for this type of company in the market are not very clear. This document will be published in the coming months.
