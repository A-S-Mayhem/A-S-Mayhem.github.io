Subject Title
======
Methodology development to guarantee building photovoltaic systems' performance including failure modelling.


Collaboration
======
The PhD is in collaboration within 3 entities:
* Heliocity: Industrial expert in performance assesment of building photovoltaic installations via data-driven methods
* CSTB (Scientific and Technical Center for Building): Scientific industrial expert on building energy performance with known experimental know-how
* LOCIE (Laboratory for Design Optimization and Environmental Engineering):  Joint research unit of the Université Savoie Mont Blanc and CNRS working in engineering sciences and systems


Subject Content
======
The objective of the thesis is to define and validate a methodology to guarantee the real performance of photovoltaic systems on buildings that can be widely deployed. This method could be envisioned to inspect new installations upon receipt, but also existing installations, to suggest a rehabilitation plan that would be the most effective. This work should contribute to the implementation of a new normative approach of the “Guarantee of Energy Results” type. The thesis work starts with a state of the art and then an analysis on experimental data obtained from real BIPV installations. This would lead to assess diagnostic methods, their limits and the main failures which will be modeled. Then, the performance guarantee methodology should be established.
