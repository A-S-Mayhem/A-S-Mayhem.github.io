## 2022/03/07 #5
Low clouds on my walk \
Jeans and pajamas are warm \
I'll work out later

## 2022/03/06 #4
Another long drive \
This time I'm going back home \
Then, more vidya

## 2022/03/05 #3
Woken by the sun \
Frost covers the ground outside \
Vidya, inside

## 2022/03/04 #2
Missing my Kitty \
Long drive to see family \
Worthwhile in the end

## 2022/03/03 #1
Riding in the rain \
My bike is brand spanking new \
I hope I don't die
