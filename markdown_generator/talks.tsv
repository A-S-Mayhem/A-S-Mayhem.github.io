Exploring the implications of climate and land-use change for hydropower operations: Insights from the Tapajos River Basin	Talk	talk-1	Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL)	2015-08-15	Brasilia, Brazil		In this talk, I had the opportunity to delve into the fascinating subject of the implications of climate and land-use change for hydropower operations. Specifically, I focused on the remarkable research conducted on the Tapajos River Basin, where the replacement of native vegetation with agricultural lands has prompted significant short-, medium-, and long-term changes in evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and surface runoff.
Integrating ecosystem models and hydrological routing for assessing climate change and land use impacts on surface hydrology	Seminar	seminar-1	Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science (Nateko)	2019-10-24	Lund, Sweden		In this seminar, I had the opportunity to discuss the results of integrating the Ecosystem Demography (ED2) model with a hydrological routing scheme, showcasing its potential for advancing our understanding of surface hydrology dynamics.
