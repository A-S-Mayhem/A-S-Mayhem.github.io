Long-term noise interferometry analysis in the northeast Pacific Ocean	Talk	talk-1	Acoustical Society of America	2021-05-01		https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/10.0004609	"Noise interferometry is the method of passively estimating acoustic propagation using ambient sound. It has been used for long-term ocean monitoring applications such as tomography, thermometry, and measuring flow velocity. Using noise interferometry, the time domain Greene's function (TDGF) between two locations can be estimated. In this talk, we use 6 years (2015-2020) of acoustic data recorded by two hydrophones in the northeast Pacific Ocean to analyze the long-term TDGF. The hydrophones are deployed at the Cabled Array which is maintained by the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). They are separated by 3.2 km, located on the ocean floor at a depth of 1500 m, and have a sampling rate of 200 Hz. We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the TDGF estimate for different propagation paths and study how it varies for different average times, local shipping densities, and oceanographic variables such as sound speed.

Estimating ocean variables using ambient noise interferometry	Talk	talk-2	Acoustical Society of America	2021-11-01	"Seattle, WA"	https://asa.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1121/10.0007697	"Ambient noise interferometry is a method of estimating the time domain Greene's function (TDGF) by correlating and averaging sound from adjacent hydrophones. These averaged cross correlations are called noise cross correlation functions (NCCFs). Noise interferometry has been used in ocean acoustics to estimate ocean variables such as water temperature by measuring propagation times. In this talk, a 6-year NCCF stack between two Ocean Observatories Initiative cabled array hydrophones is investigated. The hydrophones are separated by 3.2 km, and are bottom mounted at a depth of 1500 meters. They are located in the caldera of the Axial Seamount volcano approximately 470 km off the Oregon coast. The TDGF estimate from the NCCF stack contains clear, multipath arrivals. Fluctuations in the arrival time over the six years are on the order of a single time bin. However, if the signal to noise ratio is high enough, it is possible to measure the arrival times with more accuracy than a single time bin. In this presentation, signal processing methods to accurately estimate the propagation time will be explored, as well as the viability of inverting these multipath arrival times to estimate ocean variables such as water temperature.

OOIPy: A Python toolbox for accessing and analyzing data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative	Talk	talk-3	Acoustical Society of America	2021-11-01	"Seattle, WA"	https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/10.0007845	"The recent advent of long-term, large-scale, and publicly available underwater acoustic datasets can unlock new discoveries and fuel a deeper understanding of the ocean environment. One such dataset is provided by the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), who maintain multiple research arrays distributed across the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean that feature a variety of instruments and platforms from hydrophones to water column profilers and surface buoys. However, analyzing the OOI data can be challenging, as tools for accessing the data are either completely lacking, or require a significant amount of additional programming effort to prepare data for analysis. With the development of the Python package OOIPy we aim to address these problems for the OOI data products. OOIPy combines low level functions for accessing OOI data in Python with higher level functions for data processing, analysis, and visualization. Currently, data products from low-frequency and broadband hydrophones, which are only available through the OOI raw data server, as well as conductivity, temperature, depths sensors in the northeast Pacific Ocean are supported. Our vision for the future is to expand OOIPy and allow scientists to focus on the analysis, rather than the accessing and preprocessing, of OOI data products. [Work supported by ONR.]"
Ship detection from passive underwater acoustic recordings using machine learning	Talk	talk-4	Acoustical Society of America	2021-11-01	"Seattle, WA"	https://asa.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1121/10.0007848	"The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) hydrophone data contains a rich collection of ship passage events that can be leveraged for passive ship detection. This study uses 6 years of OOI acoustic data collected by the hydrophone located at the southern foot of the Axial Seamount volcano with a sampling rate of 200 Hz. Ship location data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used to predict the presence or absence of ships within an effective radius of the hydrophone, estimated to be 15 km. After, identifying ships with similar acoustic profiles, such as commercial carrier, tanker, cargo, container, and supply ships, a balanced dataset is created with an even distribution of ships within and outside of the estimated radius. The final dataset is separated into a training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) dataset, and then used to create k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and logistic regression models using the scikit-learn Python library. The KNN model achieves the best performance and classifies the ships with an accuracy of 98.04%. This shows that it is possible to determine the presence of ships from passive underwater acoustic recordings with high accuracy. [Work supported by the SURIEA program and ONR.]"
An overview of ambient sound using OOI hydrophone network	Talk	talk-5	Acoustical Society of America	2021-11-01	"Seattle, WA"	https://asa.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1121/10.0007594	"The NSF-funded Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) is a large-scale project that provides a unique observation of the ocean, collecting acoustic, meteorological, and oceanic datasets. Specifically, for hydrophone data, there are five low frequency hydrophones (Fs_=_200 Hz), and six broadband hydrophones (Fs_=_64 kHz) dispersed around the north-east pacific. This acoustic dataset presents numerous potential areas of study in the field of ambient sound analysis. In this talk, we analysis 6 years of acoustic data to identify prominent features that are present in the OOI acoustic dataset. Some notable occurrences that are observed in the dataset include volcanic activity, rain and wind noise, fin whale vocalizations, and shipping events. For all low frequency hydrophones and four of the six broadband hydrophones, we will present long-term spectrograms, time-series trends for different spectral bands, different acoustic features that are present in the dataset, and different statistical metrics about the acoustic environment. We find that 6-year, acoustic, trends vary depending on the location of the hydrophone and the spectral band that is observed. Some locations and spectral bands see increases in spectral levels while others see decreases in spectral levels over the course of the 6 years. [Work supported by ONR.]"
Long-term ambient noise interferometry in the NE Pacific deep ocean	Talk	talk-6	Ocean Sciences Meeting	2022-02-01			"Ambient noise interferometry is the method of using ambient sound to measure the time domain Greene's function (TDGF) between two nodes. Ambient noise interferometry is a well-developed technique in seismic imaging applications, allowing for the measurement of surface wave velocities using microseisms. Ambient noise interferometry has also been used in acoustic oceanography to measure oceanographic variables such as water temperature and flow velocity. Along with measuring the TDGF, ambient noise interferometry can also be used to characterize the directionality of coherent sound in the ocean. In this talk, we use six years of ambient sound data recorded by two bottom mounted hydrophones to investigate ambient noise interferometry in the deep ocean. The hydrophones are separated by 3.2 km and are both at a depth of 1500 m. We show that the TDGF between the two hydrophones can be resolved with averaging times around 200 hours. Additionally, the TDGF contains clear, multi-path arrivals. These multi-path arrivals have not been previously observed with ambient noise interferometry in the deep ocean. We also observe a chorus of fin whale vocalizations originating from near Alaska, that is not visible in data recorded by a single hydrophone. Lastly, the viability of using multi-path arrival times in the deep ocean for passive acoustic tomography will be explored. Multi-path arrival times provide a unique opportunity for ocean observation since they contain information about the entire, deep ocean, water column. We will present ocean acoustic simulations to estimate the expected seasonal fluctuations of the multi-path arrival times due to temperature changes and we will evaluate the viability of using the multi-path peaks measured with ambient noise interferometry for passive acoustic tomography.

Exploring surface source distributions for ocean ambient noise interferometry with airgun shots	Talk	talk-7	Acoustical Society of America	2022-05-01	"Denver, WA"	https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/10.0011063	"Ambient noise interferometry utilizes the cross-correlations of ambient sound to estimate the time domain Green's function (TDGF). We have previously shown that ambient noise interferometry can resolve multi-path arrivals between two bottom-mounted hydrophones separated by 3.2 km, at a depth of 1500 m, and located 470 km off the Oregon coast. In 2019, a seismic reflection survey was conducted directly over the two hydrophones for 28 days covering a 763 km2 area. The airgun shots occurred every 37.5 m while the ship moved at a speed of _4.5 knots, equivalent to a shooting interval of 16 s. The hydrophone recordings during this survey provide the unique opportunity to understand the effects of the surface source distribution on the noise cross correlation function (NCCF). In this talk, we show the sensitivity of the NCCF to the surface source locations using simulated and experimental data. Then, we use the image source method to analytically define the location of the sound sources that contribute to different delay times in the NCCF. [Work supported by ONR.]"
Overview of ocean ambient noise interferometry - theory and simulation	Talk	talk-8	Acoustical Society of America	2022-12-01	"Nashville, TN"		"[Won 2nd best student paper award] Ambient noise interferometry is a passive acoustic technique for environment characterization. The technique uses coherent ambient sound to approximate the Green's function between two sensors. It has previously been used in ocean acoustics to passively estimate water temperature, sound-speed structure, and mode shapes as well as for sensor localization. Since this technique utilizes the ambient noise field, whose characteristics are often unknown, understanding the effects of non-isotropic ambient sound is important for ambient noise interferometry. In this talk an overview of the theoretical literature for noise interferometry will be presented with a specific emphasis on the effects of non-isotropic ocean noise source distributions. Additionally, simulations that explore the emergence of the Green's function will be presented. Specifically, sound source distributions and environmental parameters such as sound speed profile will be explored. Lastly, the implications of these works on the possibilities and limitations of ambient noise interferometry will be discussed. [work supported by ONR]"
Overview of ambient noise research and outreach with OOI hydrophones	Poster	talk-9	American Geophysical Union	2022-12-01	"Chicago, IL"		"The ocean observatories initiative has eleven hydrophones that constantly record ambient sound throughout the north-east Pacific Ocean. Nine of the hydrophones are mounted on the seafloor and two of the hydrophones are suspended in the sound fixing and ranging channel. Six of the hydrophones record broadband ambient sound with a sampling rate of 64 kHz. Five of the hydrophones record low frequency ambient sound with a sampling rate of 200 Hz. In this talk, an overview of research and outreach conducted by the Ocean Data Lab at the University of Washington that utilizes this acoustic data will be presented. Some of the research topics that will be presented include trends in ambient sound and using ambient noise interferometry to estimate the Green's function between two hydrophones. For the trends in ambient sound, data from 9 of the hydrophones over six years is visualized, analyzed, and compared to previous results. Data recorded by two low-frequency hydrophones has successfully been used to estimate the Green's function between the two hydrophones by measuring the coherence of the ambient sound. Additionally, data of opportunity has been used to experimentally explore the emergence of the Green's function for bottom mounted hydrophones in the north-east pacific. Lastly, an online, interactive data explorer for the low frequency hydrophones will be presented. This data explorer provides the opportunity for the public to view and explore the low frequency acoustic data measured and provided by the Ocean Observatories Initiative. [work supported by ONR]"
Using Coherent Ambient Sound to Learn About the Ocean	Seminar Talk	talk-10	Applied Physics Laboratory - UW	2022-11-03	"Seattle, WA"		"With deep oceans absorbing most of the additional heat due to human caused climate change, it is important to be able to monitor the deep ocean. Can ambient sound be used as a tool to monitor the deep ocean? Coherent ambient sound can contain a lot of useful information about the environment that the sound is propagating in. If the distribution of sound sources is favorable, you can even estimate the Green's function between two sensors using just ambient coherent sound. The Green's function estimate could then be used to infer oceanographic variables. This technique is called ambient noise interferometry. In this talk, long-term acoustic data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative is used to explore the possibilities of using ambient noise interferometry in the deep ocean for long-term ocean monitoring.
