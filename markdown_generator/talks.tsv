Exploring the implications of climate and land-use change for hydropower operations: Insights from the Tapajos River Basin	Talk	talk-1	Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (ANEEL)	15/08/2015	"Brasilia, Brazil"		"In this talk, I had the opportunity to delve into the fascinating subject of the implications of climate and land-use change for hydropower operations. Specifically, I focused on the remarkable research conducted on the Tapajos River Basin, where the replacement of native vegetation with agricultural lands has prompted significant short-, medium-, and long-term changes in evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and surface runoff."
Integrating ecosystem models and hydrological routing for assessing climate change and land use impacts on surface hydrology	Seminar	seminar-1	Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science (Nateko)	24/10/2019	"Lund, Sweden"		"In this seminar, I had the opportunity to discuss the results of integrating the Ecosystem Demography (ED2) model with a hydrological routing scheme, showcasing its potential for advancing our understanding of surface hydrology dynamics."
Impact of Insect Herbivory on Ecosystem Productivity and Transpiration from a Modified Version of the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED2)	Seminar	seminar-2	Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science (Nateko)	26/03/2024	"Lund, Sweden"		"In this seminar, I shared preliminary results and findings will be shared in a seminar, along with discussions on co-funding mechanisms in Brazilian states to support participation in Horizon Europe collaborative projects."
