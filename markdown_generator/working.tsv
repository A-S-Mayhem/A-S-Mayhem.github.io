2021-11-05	Benchmark Currency Stochastic Discount Factors	"Valeri Sokolovski,Erik Sverdrup"	Review of Finance	"We examine the pricing performance of out-of-sample pricing factors in the broad cross-section of currency returns. To this end, we develop a methodology for estimating empirical minimum-dispersion stochastic discount factors (SDFs) under constraints on maximum position leverage. Under leverage constraints compatible with those observed in the currency markets, our empirical SDFs deliver smaller out-of-sample pricing errors than existing factor models, and are priced in individual currency and hedge fund cross-sections. After transaction costs, an investable SDF portfolio delivers a Sharpe ratio of around 0.8 and positively skewed returns. These empirical SDFs offer tractable benchmarks for candidate currency pricing models."

2021-10-18	Modeling Conditional Factor Risk Premia Implied by Index Option Returns	"Mathieu Fournier,Kris Jacobs"	Journal of Finance	"We propose a novel factor model for option returns. Option exposures are estimated nonparametrically and factor risk premia can vary nonlinearly with states. The model is estimated using regressions, with minimal assumptions on factor and option return dynamics. Using index options, we characterize the conditional risk premia for the market return, market variance, and tail and intermediary risk factors. All average risk premia have the expected sign and meaningful magnitudes. Market and variance risk premia display pronounced time-variation, spike during crises, and always have the expected sign. Combined, market return and variance explain more than 90% of option return variation."

2021-07-28	On the Nature of (Jump) Skewness Risk Premia	"Paul Schneider,Fabio Trojani"	Management Science	"We propose a model-free method for measuring the jump skewness risk premium via a trading strategy. We find that in the S&P 500 option market, the premium is positive and greater in absolute terms than the variance premium. The trading strategy  llows for examining the premium in different holding periods: daytime, when markets are open, and overnight, outside of trading hours. We demonstrate that both premia vary considerably between trading and non-trading periods, and also increase in   riods of market distress. The daytime return on jump skewness is not spanned by other systematic risk factors, suggesting it is a systematic risk factor itself. Outside of trading hours, skewness risk does not seem to be distinguishable from variance risk.  We  lso decompose total return skewness into a jump component, and a signed variance component, and demonstrate that only the jump component is priced. Our work also sketches a new set of stylized facts about variance and jump skewness premia that  option pricing models should match."

2020-01-13	High-Frequency Tail Risk Premium and Stock Return Predictability	"Caio Almeida,Kym Ardison,Rene Garcia"	Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis	"This paper proposes a new measure of tail risk premium obtained from high-frequency stock returns. Risk adjustment is based on a nonparametric estimation of the state price density that tilts the return distribution to satisfy the Euler equation. Empirically, our daily tail risk premium factor extracted from intra-day S\&P 500 returns consistently forecasts the future distribution of market returns, including the mean, higher moments and a large range of quantiles. Among established benchmark measures of tail and variance risk, it appears as the most significant predictor for expected returns on a cross-section of characteristic-based portfolios. Moreover, it is also a robust predictor of the variance risk premia suggesting that investors' aversion to downside risk is also an important determinant of risk premium in high frequency markets."

2019-04-11	Arbitrage Free Dispersion	"Fabio Trojani,Andras Sali"	asd	"We develop a theory of arbitrage-free dispersion (AFD) that characterizes the testable restrictions of asset pricing models. AFD measures Jensen's gap in the cumulant generating function of pricing kernels and returns. It implies a wide family of model-free dispersion constraints, which extend dispersion and co-dispersion bounds in the literature and are applicable with a unifying approach in multivariate and multiperiod settings. Empirically, the dispersion of stationary and martingale pricing kernel components in the benchmark long-run risk model yields a counterfactual dependence of short- vs. long-maturity bond returns and is insufficient for pricing optimal portfolios of market equity and short-term bonds."
