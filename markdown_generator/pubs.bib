abstract = {Abstract A major hurdle to the successful deployment of high-energy-density lithium metal based batteries is dendrite growth during battery cycling, which raises safety and cycle life concerns. Coating the Li metal anode with a soft polymer layer has been previously shown to be effective in suppressing dendrite growth, leading to uniform lithium deposition even at high current densities. A 3D coarse-grained molecular model to study the mechanism of dendrite suppression is presented. It is found that the most effective coatings delay or even prevent dendrites from penetrating the polymer layer during deposition. The optimal deposition can be achieved by jointly tuning the polymer stiffness and relaxation time. Higher polymer dielectric permittivity and coating thickness are also effective, but the deposition rate and, therefore, the charging current density is reduced. These findings provide the basis for rational design of soft polymer coatings for stable lithium deposition.},

abstract = {Abstract 2D-material-based membranes with densely packed sub-nanometer-height fluidic channels show exceptional transport properties, and have attracted broad research interest for energy-, environment-, and healthcare-related applications. Recently, light-controlled active transport of ionic species in abiotic materials have received renewed attention. However, its dependence on inhomogeneous or site-specific illumination is a challenge for scalable application. Here, directional proton transport through printed asymmetric graphene oxide superstructures (GOSs) is demonstrated under full-area illumination. The GOSs are composed of partially stacked graphene oxide multilayers formed by a two-step direct ink writing process. The direction of the photoinduced proton current is determined by the position of top graphene oxide multilayers, which functions as a photogate to modulate the horizontal ion transport through the beneath lamellar nanochannels. This transport phenomenon unveils a new driving mechanism that, in asymmetric nanofluidic structures, the decay of local light intensity in depth direction breaks the balance of electric potential distribution in horizontal direction, and thus generates a photoelectric driving force for ion transport. Following this mechanism, the GOSs are developed into photonic ion transistors with three different gating modes. The asymmetrically printed photonic-ionic devices provide fundamental elements for light-harvesting nanofluidic circuits, and may find applications for artificial photosynthesis and artificial electric organs.}

abstract={Conventional carbonate-based electrolytes with high corrosion towards Li metal result in massive dendrite growth and limited cycling life, particularly true for practical Li-metal batteries with high cathode loading (>3.5{\thinspace}mAh{\thinspace}cm−2). Herein we design an asymmetric Li salt, lithium 1,1,1-trifluoro-N-[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)]ethyl] methanesulfonamide (LiFEA) that possesses a pseudo-crown ether-like, folded molecular geometry. It enables carbonate electrolytes with a large apparent donor number and Li+ transference number and drives a self-cleaning mechanism for solid--electrolyte interphases, enhancing compatibility with Li-metal anodes even at high current densities. LiFEA-based carbonate electrolytes notably improved fast-cycling performances of Li{\thinspace}|{\thinspace}|NCM811 cells.

Electrolytes play pivotal roles in the stabilization of Li metal surface and operation at high voltages. In particular, localized high-concentration electrolytes have outperformed state-of-the-art electrolytes due to their unique solvation structures. However, a direct correlation between solvation structure in LHCEs, in particular for weakly coordinated diluents, and SEI composition is not well understood, yet it is highly critical to realize high Coulombic efficiency (CE) beyond 99.5%. Here, a class of electrolyte based on bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)methane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane was introduced to regulate anion decomposition to achieve ultra-high Li2O content of 63% in the SEI along with a highly uniform phase distribution. These unique features enabled a record-high CE of 99.72% and proved the impact of homogeneously distributed high Li2O SEI. The related Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell with a negative/positive capacity ratio of 2.5 achieved 90% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C and 80% retention after 596 cycles at 3 C.}

The specific energy of commercial lithium (Li)-ion batteries is reaching the theoretical limit. Future consumer electronics and electric vehicle markets call for the development of high energy density Li metal batteries, which have been plagued by poor cyclability. Electrolyte engineering can afford a promising approach to address the issues associated with Li metal batteries and has recently resulted in much improved cycle life under practical conditions. However, gaps still exist between the performance of current Li metal batteries and those required for commercial applications. Further improvements will require systematic analysis of existing electrolyte design methodologies. In this review, we first summarize recent approaches of advanced electrolytes for Li metal batteries paired with high-voltage cathodes. We then extract common features among these advanced electrolytes and finally discuss the future rational design directions and strategies.}

Also, the suspension electrolyte design is applied in conventional and state-of-the-art high-performance electrolytes to demonstrate its applicability.

abstract = {Abstract Novel electrolyte designs to further enhance the lithium (Li) metal battery cyclability are highly desirable. Here, fluorinated 1,6-dimethoxyhexane (FDMH) is designed and synthesized as the solvent molecule to promote electrolyte stability with its prolonged –CF2– backbone. Meanwhile, 1,2-dimethoxyethane is used as a co-solvent to enable higher ionic conductivity and much reduced interfacial resistance. Combining the dual-solvent system with 1 m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), high Li-metal Coulombic efficiency (99.5\%) and oxidative stability (6 V) are achieved. Using this electrolyte, 20 µm Li||NMC batteries are able to retain ≈80\% capacity after 250 cycles and Cu||NMC anode-free pouch cells last 120 cycles with 75\% capacity retention under ≈2.1 µL mAh−1 lean electrolyte conditions. Such high performances are attributed to the anion-derived solid-electrolyte interphase, originating from the coordination of Li-ions to the highly stable FDMH and multiple anions in their solvation environments. This work demonstrates a new electrolyte design strategy that enables high-performance Li-metal batteries with multisolvent Li-ion solvation with rationally optimized molecular structure and ratio.},

abstract={Next-generation wearable electronics require enhanced mechanical robustness and device complexity. Besides previously reported softness and stretchability, desired merits for practical use include elasticity, solvent resistance, facile patternability and high charge carrier mobility. Here, we show a molecular design concept that simultaneously achieves all these targeted properties in both polymeric semiconductors and dielectrics, without compromising electrical performance. This is enabled by covalently-embedded in-situ rubber matrix (iRUM) formation through good mixing of iRUM precursors with polymer electronic materials, and finely-controlled composite film morphology built on azide crosslinking chemistry which leverages different reactivities with C--H and C=C bonds. The high covalent crosslinking density results in both superior elasticity and solvent resistance. When applied in stretchable transistors, the iRUM-semiconductor film retained its mobility after stretching to 100{\%} strain, and exhibited record-high mobility retention of 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 after 1000 stretching-releasing cycles at 50{\%} strain. The cycling life was stably extended to 5000 cycles, five times longer than all reported semiconductors. Furthermore, we fabricated elastic transistors via consecutively photo-patterning of the dielectric and semiconducting layers, demonstrating the potential of solution-processed multilayer device manufacturing. The iRUM represents a molecule-level design approach towards robust skin-inspired electronics.},

abstract={Electrolyte engineering is critical for developing Li metal batteries. While recent works improved Li metal cyclability, a methodology for rational electrolyte design remains lacking. Herein, we propose a design strategy for electrolytes that enable anode-free Li metal batteries with single-solvent single-salt formations at standard concentrations. Rational incorporation of --CF2-- units yields fluorinated 1,4-dimethoxylbutane as the electrolyte solvent. Paired with 1 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, this electrolyte possesses unique Li--F binding and high anion/solvent ratio in the solvation sheath, leading to excellent compatibility with both Li metal anodes (Coulombic efficiency{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}99.52{\%} and fast activation within five cycles) and high-voltage cathodes ({\textasciitilde}6 V stability). Fifty-$\mu$m-thick Li|NMC batteries retain 90{\%} capacity after 420 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98{\%}. Industrial anode-free pouch cells achieve {\textasciitilde}325{\thinspace}Wh{\thinspace}kg−1 single-cell energy density and 80{\%} capacity retention after 100 cycles. Our design concept for electrolytes provides a promising path to high-energy, long-cycling Li metal batteries.},

abstract = {There has been considerable interest in the use of polymer membranes for solvent nanofiltration. While the pore size of nanofiltration membranes is generally known to be within 0.5–2 nm, the precise control of pore size and quantitative understanding of the role of pore size are experimentally challenging. By molecular simulations, in this study, we investigate solvent nanofiltration through polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes with different pore sizes. Five PBI model membranes are constructed and pretreated by methanol, with the mean pore size (MPZ) ranging from 3.53 to 6.38 Å. When the MPZ increases, large pores are more populated and connected in the membrane. It is revealed that methanol permeation is governed by the presence and interconnectivity of large pores. For the membrane with a MPZ of 6.38 Å, the permeation of methanol and water is simulated. Compared with methanol, water permeation is faster but slowed down at a later stage due to membrane compression. The rejection of a model solute, glucose, is found to be 100%. This simulation study highlights the crucial role of pore size, as well as pretreatment, in solvent permeation, and would facilitate the development of new membranes for high-performance solvent nanofiltration.}
