	abstract = {Nail psoriasis significantly impacts the quality of life in patients with psoriasis, which affects approximately 2--3% of the population worldwide. Disease severity measures are essential in guiding treatment and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. However, due to subsidy, convenience and low costs of health care in Taiwan, doctor usually needs to manage nearly hundreds of patients in single outpatient clinic, leading to difficulty in performing complex assessment tools. For instance, Nail Psoriasis Severity index (NAPSI) is used by dermatologists to measure the severity of nail psoriasis in clinical trials, but its calculation is quite time-consuming, which hampers its application in daily clinical practice. Therefore, we developed a simple, fast and automatic system for the assessment of nail psoriasis severity by constructing a standard photography capturing system combined with utilizing one of the deep learning architectures, mask R-CNN. This system not only assist doctors in capturing signs of disease and normal skin, but also able to extract features without pre-processing of image data. Expectantly, the system could help dermatologists make accurate diagnosis, assessment as well as provide precise treatment decision more efficiently.},

	abstract = {Defects in crystalline materials are of broad and fundamental interest. In condensed-matter physics, defect dynamics contain essential information about the microscopic processes of crystal formation and melting. Two-dimensional melting (2D) is widely accepted to be mediated by the proliferation of edge dislocations. In 2D crystals, vacancies and interstitials are, in fact, bound pairs of edge dislocations and disclinations. They are expected to play critical roles in 2D melting. We demonstrated significant progress in quantifying the dynamical processes of interstitials. We also propose a simple yet powerful method in visualizing the time-averaged configurations of the defects, providing a direct tool to assess whether the detailed balance is obeyed or violated in the fluctuating processes in a lattice. In two-dimensional (2D) solids, point defects, i.e., vacancies and interstitials, are bound states of topological defects of edge dislocations and disclinations. They are expected to play an important role in the thermodynamics of the system. Yet very little is known about the detailed dynamical processes of these defects. Two-dimensional colloidal crystals of submicrometer microspheres provide a convenient model solid system in which the microscopic dynamics of these defects can be studied in real time using video microscopy. Here we report a study of the dynamical processes of interstitials in a 2D colloidal crystal. The diffusion constants of both mono- and diinterstitials are measured and found to be significantly larger than those of vacancies. Diinterstitials are clearly slower than monointerstitials. We found that, by plotting the accumulative positions of five- and sevenfold disclinations relative to the center-of-mass position of the defect, a sixfold symmetric pattern emerges for monointerstitials. This is indicative of an equilibrium behavior that satisfies local detailed balance that the lattice remains elastic and can be thermally excited between lattice configurations reversibly. However, for diinterstitials the sixfold symmetry is not observed in the same time window, and the local lattice distortions are too severe to recover quickly. This observation suggests a possible route to creating local melting of a lattice (similarly one can create local melting by creating divacancies). This work opens up an avenue for microscopic studies of the dynamics of melting in colloidal model systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement (nanoDLD) has emerged as an effective method for separating nanoscopic colloids for applications in molecular biology, yet present limits in throughput, purification, on-chip filtration, and workflow restricting its adoption as a practical separation technology. To overcome these impediments, array scaling and parallelization for integrated nanoDLD (i-nanoDLD) enrichment devices are developed to achieve a density of ≈83 arrays mm−2 with 31 160 parallel arrays, producing an ≈30-fold concentration of the target colloid and a record throughput of 17 mL h−1. Purification using a dual-fluid input embodiment of i-nanoDLD is demonstrated to successfully remove background contaminants from target colloid samples, including urine. Used serially, high-throughput enrichment and purification chips achieve >1700 gain in particle over protein concentration compared to input sample. Additionally, integration of upstream filter banks shows improved operation lifetime > 7× for particles with diameters close to the gap size. Finally, the integrated design and associated flow rates allow a straightforward approach to chip-to-world interfacing as demonstrated using a prototype system for facile, turn-key sample processing. Collectively, these developments advance nanoDLD into the range of sample volumes and process times needed for research and clinical samples.},

@article{Kim:2021tj,
	abstract = {While it would be desirable that the output of binary classification algorithms be the probability that the classification is correct, most algorithms do not provide a method to calculate such a probability. We propose a probabilistic output for binary classifiers based on an unexpected mapping of the probability of correct classification to the probability of occupation of a fermion in a quantum system, known as the Fermi--Dirac distribution. This mapping allows us to compute the optimal threshold to separate predicted classes and to calculate statistical parameters necessary to estimate confidence intervals of performance metrics. Using this mapping we propose an ensemble learning algorithm. In short, the Fermi--Dirac distribution provides a calibrated probabilistic output for binary classification. Binary classification is one of the central problems in machine-learning research and, as such, investigations of its general statistical properties are of interest. We studied the ranking statistics of items in binary classification problems and observed that there is a formal and surprising relationship between the probability of a sample belonging to one of the two classes and the Fermi--Dirac distribution determining the probability that a fermion occupies a given single-particle quantum state in a physical system of noninteracting fermions. Using this equivalence, it is possible to compute a calibrated probabilistic output for binary classifiers. We show that the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) in a classification problem is related to the temperature of an equivalent physical system. In a similar manner, the optimal decision threshold between the two classes is associated with the chemical potential of an equivalent physical system. Using our framework, we also derive a closed-form expression to calculate the variance for the AUC of a classifier. Finally, we introduce FiDEL (Fermi--Dirac-based ensemble learning), an ensemble learning algorithm that uses the calibrated nature of the classifier's output probability to combine possibly very different classifiers.},

@article{Felden:2021tn,
	abstract = {Objective Surveillance tools for early cancer detection are suboptimal, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and biomarkers are urgently needed. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained increasing scientific interest due to their involvement in tumour initiation and metastasis; however, most extracellular RNA (exRNA) blood-based biomarker studies are limited to annotated genomic regions.Design EVs were isolated with differential ultracentrifugation and integrated nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement arrays (nanoDLD) and quality assessed by electron microscopy, immunoblotting, nanoparticle tracking and deconvolution analysis. Genome-wide sequencing of the largely unexplored small exRNA landscape, including unannotated transcripts, identified and reproducibly quantified small RNA clusters (smRCs). Their key genomic features were delineated across biospecimens and EV isolation techniques in prostate cancer and HCC. Three independent exRNA cancer datasets with a total of 479 samples from 375 patients, including longitudinal samples, were used for this study.Results ExRNA smRCs were dominated by uncharacterised, unannotated small RNA with a consensus sequence of 20 nt. An unannotated 3-smRC signature was significantly overexpressed in plasma exRNA of patients with HCC (p\&lt;0.01, n=157). An independent validation in a phase 2 biomarker case{\textendash}control study revealed 86\% sensitivity and 91\% specificity for the detection of early HCC from controls at risk (n=209) (area under the receiver operating curve (AUC): 0.87). The 3-smRC signature was independent of alpha-fetoprotein (p\&lt;0.0001) and a composite model yielded an increased AUC of 0.93.Conclusion These findings directly lead to the prospect of a minimally invasive, blood-only, operator-independent clinical tool for HCC surveillance, thus highlighting the potential of unannotated smRCs for biomarker research in cancer.Data are available in a public, open access repository.

	abstract = {We studied the trajectories of polymers being advected while diffusing in a pressure driven flow along a periodic pillar nanostructure known as nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement (nanoDLD) array. We found that polymers follow different trajectories depending on their length{,} flow velocity and pillar array geometry{,} demonstrating that nanoDLD devices can be used as a continuous polymer fractionation tool. As a model system{,} we used double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with various contour lengths and demonstrated that dsDNA in the range of 100--10 000 base pairs (bp) can be separated with a size-selective resolution of 200 bp. In contrast to spherical colloids{,} a polymer elongates by shear flow and the angle of polymer trajectories with respect to the mean flow direction decreases as the mean flow velocity increases. We developed a phenomenological model that explains the qualitative dependence of the polymer trajectories on the gap size and on the flow velocity. Using this model{,} we found the optimal separation conditions for dsDNA of different sizes and demonstrated the separation and extraction of dsDNA fragments with over 75% recovery and 3-fold concentration. Importantly{,} this velocity dependence provides a means of fine-tuning the separation efficiency and resolution{,} independent of the nanoDLD pillar geometry.},
