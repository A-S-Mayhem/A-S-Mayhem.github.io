Herein we report the development of a high-throughput setup for the cycling of redox flow batteries. Using common negolyte redox-active aqueous organics, we benchmark capacity fade rates and compare variations in measured cycling behavior of nominally identical volumetrically unbalanced compositionally symmetric cells. We propose figures of merit for consideration when cycling sets of identical cells, and compare three common electrochemical cycling protocols typically used in battery cycling: constant current, constant current followed by constant voltage, and constant voltage. Redox-active organics exhibiting either high or low capacity fade rates are employed in the cell cycling protocol comparison, with results analyzed from over 50 flow cells.},

  abstract  = {The library of redox-active organics that are potential candidates for electrochemical energy storage in flow batteries is exceedingly vast, necessitating high-throughput characterization of molecular lifetimes. Demonstrated extremely stable chemistries require accurate yet rapid cell cycling tests, a demand often frustrated by time-denominated capacity fade mechanisms. We have developed a high-throughput setup for elevated temperature cycling of redox flow batteries, providing a new dimension in characterization parameter space to explore. We utilize it to evaluate capacity fade rates of aqueous redox-active organic molecules, as functions of temperature. We demonstrate Arrhenius-like behavior in the temporal capacity fade rates of multiple flow battery electrolytes, permitting extrapolation to lower operating temperatures. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of accelerated decomposition protocols to expedite the screening process of candidate molecules for long lifetime flow batteries.},
