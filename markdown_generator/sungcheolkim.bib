	abstract = {Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is a technique for size fractionation of particles in continuous flow that has shown great potential for biological and clinical applications. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the trajectories of different-sized particles in relation to the geometry of the pillar array, but experimental evidence has demonstrated that a rich class of intermediate migration behavior exists, which is not predicted by models. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework to infer the trajectory of particles in the whole array on the basis of trajectories in the unit cell. This framework explains many of the unexpected particle trajectories reported in literature and can be used to design arrays for the fractionation of particles, even at the smallest scales reaching the molecular realm. We also performed experiments that verified our predictions, even at the nanoscales. Using our model as a set of design rules, we developed a condenser structure that achieves full particle separation with a single fluidic input.
