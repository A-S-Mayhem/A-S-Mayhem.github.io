2013-08-01	Pairing multivariate data analysis and ecological modeling in the biomanipulated lake Engelsholm, Denmark	VATTEN – Journal of Water Management and Research	In this study, we focused on identifying the most important patterns of monthly time series after biomanipulation. Moreover, we tried to quantify how those variables are interconnected with each other.		vatten-3	https://www.tidskriftenvatten.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/48_article_4607.pdf	no
2013-03-01	Simulation of scalar transport in shallow waters using an unstructured grid model (in portuguese, only)	RBRH – Brazilian Journal of Water Resources	This paper presents an application of the model to the Guaíba River, including the region of the Jacuí River delta with its intricate network of channels and islands. Two methods for solving the transport equation were tested: one based on a central difference numerical scheme and another based on a high-resolution scheme.		rbrh-1	https://www.abrhidro.org.br/SGCv3/publicacao.php?PUB=1&ID=97&SUMARIO=1486&ST=simulacao_do_transporte_de_escalares_em_corpos_d_agua_rasos_usando_um_modelo_de_grades_nao_estruturadas	yes
