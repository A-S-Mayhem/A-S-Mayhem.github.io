2021-08-04	Task offloading in Edge and Cloud Computing: A survey on mathematical, artificial intelligence and control theory solutions	Computer Networks	Next generation communication networks are expected to accommodate a high number of new and resource-voracious applications that can be offered to a large range of end users. Even though end devices are becoming more powerful, the available local resources cannot cope with the requirements of these applications. This has created a new challenge called task offloading, where computation intensive tasks need to be offloaded to more resource powerful remote devices. Naturally, the Cloud Computing is a well-tested infrastructure that can facilitate the task offloading. However, Cloud Computing as a centralized and distant infrastructure creates significant communication delays that cannot satisfy the requirements of the emerging delay-sensitive applications. To this end, the concept of Edge Computing has been proposed, where the Cloud Computing capabilities are repositioned closer to the end devices …	Saeik, F., Avgeris, M., Spatharakis, D., Santi, N., Dechouniotis, D., Violos, J., ... & Papavassiliou, S.

2018-06-18	Edge computing in IoT ecosystems for UAV-enabled early fire detection	2018 IEEE international conference on smart computing (SMARTCOMP)	Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) facilitate the development of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems for smart city and smart environment applications. This paper proposes the adoption of Edge and Fog computing principles to the UAV based forest fire detection application domain through a hierarchical architecture. This three-layer ecosystem combines the powerful resources of cloud computing, the rich resources of fog computing and the sensing capabilities of the UAVs. These layers efficiently cooperate to address the key challenges imposed by the early forest fire detection use case. Initial experimental evaluations measuring crucial performance metrics indicate that critical resources, such as CPU/RAM, battery life and network resources, can be efficiently managed and dynamically allocated by the proposed approach.

2019-02-03	Where there is fire there is smoke: A scalable edge computing framework for early fire detection	Sensors	A Cyber-Physical Social System (CPSS) tightly integrates computer systems with the physical world and human activities. In this article, a three-level CPSS for early fire detection is presented to assist public authorities to promptly identify and act on emergency situations. At the bottom level, the system’s architecture involves IoT nodes enabled with sensing and forest monitoring capabilities. Additionally, in this level, the crowd sensing paradigm is exploited to aggregate environmental information collected by end user devices present in the area of interest. Since the IoT nodes suffer from limited computational energy resources, an Edge Computing Infrastructure, at the middle level, facilitates the offloaded data processing regarding possible fire incidents. At the top level, a decision-making service deployed on Cloud nodes integrates data from various sources, including users’ information on social media, and evaluates the situation criticality. In our work, a dynamic resource scaling mechanism for the Edge Computing Infrastructure is designed to address the demanding Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of this IoT-enabled time and mission critical application. The experimental results indicate that the vertical and horizontal scaling on the Edge Computing layer is beneficial for both the performance and the energy consumption of the IoT nodes.

2019-01-27	Semantic interoperability for iot platforms in support of decision making: an experiment on early wildfire detection	Sensors	One of the main obstacles towards the promotion of IoT adoption and innovation is data interoperability. Facilitating cross-domain interoperability is expected to be the core element for the realisation of the next generation of the IoT computing paradigm that is already taking shape under the name of Internet of Everything (IoE). In this article, an analysis of the current status on IoT semantic interoperability is presented that leads to the identification of a set of generic requirements that act as fundamental design principles for the specification of interoperability enabling solutions. In addition, an extension of NGSIv2 data model and API (de-facto) standards is proposed aiming to bridge the gap among IoT and social media and hence to integrate user communities with cyber-physical systems. These specifications have been utilised for the implementation of the IoT2Edge interoperability enabling mechanism which is evaluated within the context of a catastrophic wildfire incident that took place in Greece on July 2018. Weather data, social media activity, video recordings from the fire, sensor measurements and satellite data, linked to the location and the time of this fire incident have been collected, modeled in a uniform manner and fed to an early fire detection decision support system. The findings of the experiment certify that achieving minimum data interoperability with light-weight, plug-n-play mechanisms can be realised with significant benefits for our society.

2019-04-03	Adaptive resource allocation for computation offloading: A control-theoretic approach	ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT)	Although mobile devices today have powerful hardware and networking capabilities, they fall short when it comes to executing compute-intensive applications. Computation offloading (i.e., delegating resource-consuming tasks to servers located at the edge of the network) contributes toward moving to a mobile cloud computing paradigm. In this work, a two-level resource allocation and admission control mechanism for a cluster of edge servers offers an alternative choice to mobile users for executing their tasks. At the lower level, the behavior of edge servers is modeled by a set of linear systems, and linear controllers are designed to meet the system’s constraints and quality of service metrics, whereas at the upper level, an optimizer tackles the problems of load balancing and application placement toward the maximization of the number the offloaded requests. The evaluation illustrates the effectiveness of the …	Avgeris, M., Dechouniotis, D., Athanasopoulos, N., & Papavassiliou, S. (2019).
