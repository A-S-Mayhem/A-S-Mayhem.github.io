2021-08-04	Task offloading in Edge and Cloud Computing: A survey on mathematical, artificial intelligence and control theory solutions	Computer Networks	Next generation communication networks are expected to accommodate a high number of new and resource-voracious applications that can be offered to a large range of end users. Even though end devices are becoming more powerful, the available local resources cannot cope with the requirements of these applications. This has created a new challenge called task offloading, where computation intensive tasks need to be offloaded to more resource powerful remote devices. Naturally, the Cloud Computing is a well-tested infrastructure that can facilitate the task offloading. However, Cloud Computing as a centralized and distant infrastructure creates significant communication delays that cannot satisfy the requirements of the emerging delay-sensitive applications. To this end, the concept of Edge Computing has been proposed, where the Cloud Computing capabilities are repositioned closer to the end devices …	Saeik, F., Avgeris, M., Spatharakis, D., Santi, N., Dechouniotis, D., Violos, J., ... & Papavassiliou, S.

2018-06-18	Edge computing in IoT ecosystems for UAV-enabled early fire detection	2018 IEEE international conference on smart computing (SMARTCOMP)	Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) facilitate the development of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems for smart city and smart environment applications. This paper proposes the adoption of Edge and Fog computing principles to the UAV based forest fire detection application domain through a hierarchical architecture. This three-layer ecosystem combines the powerful resources of cloud computing, the rich resources of fog computing and the sensing capabilities of the UAVs. These layers efficiently cooperate to address the key challenges imposed by the early forest fire detection use case. Initial experimental evaluations measuring crucial performance metrics indicate that critical resources, such as CPU/RAM, battery life and network resources, can be efficiently managed and dynamically allocated by the proposed approach.

2019-02-03	Where there is fire there is smoke: A scalable edge computing framework for early fire detection	Sensors	A Cyber-Physical Social System (CPSS) tightly integrates computer systems with the physical world and human activities. In this article, a three-level CPSS for early fire detection is presented to assist public authorities to promptly identify and act on emergency situations. At the bottom level, the system’s architecture involves IoT nodes enabled with sensing and forest monitoring capabilities. Additionally, in this level, the crowd sensing paradigm is exploited to aggregate environmental information collected by end user devices present in the area of interest. Since the IoT nodes suffer from limited computational energy resources, an Edge Computing Infrastructure, at the middle level, facilitates the offloaded data processing regarding possible fire incidents. At the top level, a decision-making service deployed on Cloud nodes integrates data from various sources, including users’ information on social media, and evaluates the situation criticality. In our work, a dynamic resource scaling mechanism for the Edge Computing Infrastructure is designed to address the demanding Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of this IoT-enabled time and mission critical application. The experimental results indicate that the vertical and horizontal scaling on the Edge Computing layer is beneficial for both the performance and the energy consumption of the IoT nodes.

2019-01-27	Semantic interoperability for iot platforms in support of decision making: an experiment on early wildfire detection	Sensors	One of the main obstacles towards the promotion of IoT adoption and innovation is data interoperability. Facilitating cross-domain interoperability is expected to be the core element for the realisation of the next generation of the IoT computing paradigm that is already taking shape under the name of Internet of Everything (IoE). In this article, an analysis of the current status on IoT semantic interoperability is presented that leads to the identification of a set of generic requirements that act as fundamental design principles for the specification of interoperability enabling solutions. In addition, an extension of NGSIv2 data model and API (de-facto) standards is proposed aiming to bridge the gap among IoT and social media and hence to integrate user communities with cyber-physical systems. These specifications have been utilised for the implementation of the IoT2Edge interoperability enabling mechanism which is evaluated within the context of a catastrophic wildfire incident that took place in Greece on July 2018. Weather data, social media activity, video recordings from the fire, sensor measurements and satellite data, linked to the location and the time of this fire incident have been collected, modeled in a uniform manner and fed to an early fire detection decision support system. The findings of the experiment certify that achieving minimum data interoperability with light-weight, plug-n-play mechanisms can be realised with significant benefits for our society.

2019-04-03	Adaptive resource allocation for computation offloading: A control-theoretic approach	ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT)	Although mobile devices today have powerful hardware and networking capabilities, they fall short when it comes to executing compute-intensive applications. Computation offloading (i.e., delegating resource-consuming tasks to servers located at the edge of the network) contributes toward moving to a mobile cloud computing paradigm. In this work, a two-level resource allocation and admission control mechanism for a cluster of edge servers offers an alternative choice to mobile users for executing their tasks. At the lower level, the behavior of edge servers is modeled by a set of linear systems, and linear controllers are designed to meet the system’s constraints and quality of service metrics, whereas at the upper level, an optimizer tackles the problems of load balancing and application placement toward the maximization of the number the offloaded requests. The evaluation illustrates the effectiveness of the …	Avgeris, M., Dechouniotis, D., Athanasopoulos, N., & Papavassiliou, S. (2019).

2020-10-01	Meson: Optimized cross-slice communication for edge computing	IEEE Communications Magazine	Network slicing is set out to address crucial needs of 5G, including support for multi-service provisioning. Focusing on resource and performance isolation, as well as security concerns associated with multi-tenancy, existing management and orchestration (MANO) frameworks typically offer network slices in the form of isolated bundles of computing, storage, and network resources across the network infrastructure, including the edge. However, network slice instantiation in its prevailing form raises significant concerns related to performance and resource utilization, hindering potential business-to-business (B2B) synergies. In this article, we discuss a new aspect of network slicing, optimized cross-slice communication (CSC). We argue that multi-tenancy and service co-location open up unique opportunities for B2B interactions, inter-service communications, and service composition, especially in the domain of edge …	Papathanail, G., Pentelas, A., Fotoglou, I., Papadimitriou, P., Katsaros, K.

2020-11-02	A switching offloading mechanism for path planning and localization in robotic applications	2020 International Conferences on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData) and IEEE Congress on Cybermatics (Cybermatics)	Industry 4.0 applications rely on mobile robotic agents that execute many complex tasks that have strict safety and time requirements. Under this setting, the Edge Computing service delivery model allows the robotic agents to offload their computationally intensive tasks to powerful computing infrastructure in their vicinity. In this study, we propose a novel switching offloading mechanism for such robotic applications. In particular, we design opportunistic offloading strategies for the path planning and localization services of mobile robots. The offloading decision is based on the uncertainty of the robot's pose, the resource availability at the Edge of the network and the difficulty of the path planning. Our switching offloading framework is implemented and evaluated using a robot in a real Edge Computing testbed, where the trade-off between execution time and the successful completion of the robot trajectory is highlighted.

2022-01-15	ENERDGE: Distributed energy-aware resource allocation at the edge	Sensors	Mobile applications are progressively becoming more sophisticated and complex, increasing their computational requirements. Traditional offloading approaches that use exclusively the Cloud infrastructure are now deemed unsuitable due to the inherent associated delay. Edge Computing can address most of the Cloud limitations at the cost of limited available resources. This bottleneck necessitates an efficient allocation of offloaded tasks from the mobile devices to the Edge. In this paper, we consider a task offloading setting with applications of different characteristics and requirements, and propose an optimal resource allocation framework leveraging the amalgamation of the edge resources. To balance the trade-off between retaining low total energy consumption, respecting end-to-end delay requirements and load balancing at the Edge, we additionally introduce a Markov Random Field based mechanism for the distribution of the excess workload. The proposed approach investigates a realistic scenario, including different categories of mobile applications, edge devices with different computational capabilities, and dynamic wireless conditions modeled by the dynamic behavior and mobility of the users. The framework is complemented with a prediction mechanism that facilitates the orchestration of the physical resources. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is evaluated via modeling and simulation and is shown to outperform a well-known task offloading solution, as well as a more recent one.

2019-08-26	Single vision-based self-localization for autonomous robotic agents	2019 7th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW)	We present a single vision-based, self-localization method for autonomous mobile robots in a known, indoor environment. This absolute localization method is landmark assisted, therefore, we propose an algorithm that requires the extraction of a single landmark feature i.e., the length of a known edge. Our technique is based on measuring the distance from two distinct, arbitrarily positioned landmarks in the robot's environment, the locations of which are known a priori. A single camera vision system is used to perform distance estimation. The developed framework is applied to tracking a robot's pose, i.e., its position and orientation, in a Cartesian coordinate system. The position of the robot is estimated using a bilateration method, while its orientation calculation utilizes tools from projective geometry. The validity and feasibility of the approach are demonstrated through experiments.	Avgeris, M., Spatharakis, D., Athanasopoulos, N., Dechouniotis, D., & Papavassiliou, S. (2019, August).

The integration of IoT technologies in the context of Unmanned Vehicles (UxVs) and their deployment in federated, real–world testbeds introduce various challenging research issues. This paper presents the Semantic Aggregate Manager (SAM) that exploits semantic technologies for modeling and managing resources of federated IoT Testbeds. SAM introduces new semantics–based features tailored to the needs of IoT enabled UxVs, but on the same time allows the compatibility with existing legacy, “de facto” standardised protocols, currently utilized by multiple federated testbed management systems. The proposed framework is currently being deployed in order to be evaluated in real–world testbeds across several sites in Europe.
