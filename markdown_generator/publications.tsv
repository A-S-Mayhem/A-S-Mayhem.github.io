12/1/20	Mind the gap: an intervention to support caregivers with a new autism spectrum disorder diagnosis is feasible and acceptable	Pilot and feasibility Studies	"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) benefit when their caregivers can effectively advocate for appropriate services. Barriers to caregiver engagement such as provider mistrust, cultural differences, stigma, and lack of knowledge can interfere with timely service access. We describe Mind the Gap (MTG), an intervention that provides education about ASD, service navigation, and other topics relevant to families whose children have a new ASD diagnosis. MTG was developed via community partnerships and is explicitly structured to reduce engagement barriers (e.g., through peer matching, meeting flexibility, culturally-informed practices). We also present on the results of a pilot of MTG, conducted in preparation for a randomized controlled trial."	"Iadarola, S., Pellecchia, M., Stahmer, A. et al.

3/15/21	Analysis of Network Characteristics to Assess Community Capacity of Latino-Serving Organizations in Philadelphia	Journal of Urban Health	"Latino immigrants are disproportionately impacted by substance use, HIV/AIDS, domestic violence, and mental health (SAVAME). The burden of these syndemic conditions is influenced by limited access to health and social services to prevent and treat these conditions. The syndemic nature of these factors necessitates an integrated, coordinated approach to address them simultaneously. We analyzed characteristics of Latino-serving organizations in Philadelphia, PA, that provide SAVAME-related health and/or social services..."	"Dsouza, N., McGhee-Hassrick, E., Giordano, K. et al.

1/1/23	The children's brain tumor network (CBTN)-Accelerating research in pediatric central nervous system tumors through collaboration and open science	Neoplasia	"Pediatric brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children in the United States and contribute a disproportionate number of potential years of life lost compared to adult cancers. Moreover, survivors frequently suffer long-term side effects, including secondary cancers. The Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) is a multi-institutional international clinical research consortium created to advance therapeutic development through the collection and rapid distribution of biospecimens and data via open-science research platforms for real-time access and use by the global research community. The CBTN's 32 member institutions utilize a shared regulatory governance architecture at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to accelerate and maximize the use of biospecimens and data. As of August 2022, CBTN has enrolled over 4700 subjects, over 1500 parents, and collected over 65,000 …"	"Lilly, J., Rokita, J. L., Mason, J., Patton, T.

To address the urgency, Children’s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) has advanced an open science model to accelerate the research discovery for pediatric brain tumors. In first phase of Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA) effort CBTN together with Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) with support of Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center (KFDRC) created and comprehensively characterized over 1000 clinically annotated pediatric brain tumors."

To assess this and develop solutions to potential disparities in pediatric neuro-oncology, the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) and Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) working group distributed a survey to all members of the consortia regarding the state of DEI in our research environments. In parallel, the working group collated clinical data from a public CBTN dataset and a PNOC clinical trial patient cohort to assess racial, ethnic, and gender differences in clinical research participation and outcomes."
