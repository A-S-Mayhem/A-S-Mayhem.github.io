2020-05-27	Using genetics to prioritize diagnoses for rheumatology outpatients with inflammatory arthritis	Science Translational Medicine	It is challenging to quickly diagnose slowly progressing diseases. To prioritize multiple related diagnoses, we developed G-PROB (Genetic Probability tool) to calculate the probability of different diseases for a patient using genetic risk scores. We tested G-PROB for inflammatory arthritis–causing diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, and gout). After validating on simulated data, we tested G-PROB in three cohorts: 1211 patients identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes within the eMERGE database, 245 patients identified through ICD codes and medical record review within the Partners Biobank, and 243 patients first presenting with unexplained inflammatory arthritis and with final diagnoses by record review within the Partners Biobank. Calibration of G-probabilities with disease status was high, with regression coefficients from 0.90 to 1.08 (1.00 is ideal). G-probabilities discriminated true diagnoses across the three cohorts with pooled areas under the curve (95perc. CI) of 0.69 (0.67 to 0.71), 0.81 (0.76 to 0.84), and 0.84 (0.81 to 0.86), respectively. For all patients, at least one disease could be ruled out, and in 45perc. of patients, a likely diagnosis was identified with a 64perc. positive predictive value. In 35perc. of cases, the clinician’s initial diagnosis was incorrect. Initial clinical diagnosis explained 39perc. of the variance in final disease, which improved to 51perc. (P less than 0.0001) after adding G-probabilities. Converting genotype information before a clinical visit into an interpretable probability value for five different inflammatory arthritides could potentially be used to improve the diagnostic efficiency of rheumatic diseases in clinical practice.

This approach is prone to false positives. Alternatively, queries are constructed, but these are highly center and language specific. A tantalizing alternative is the automatic identification of patients by employing machine learning on format-free text entries. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop an easily implementable workflow that builds a machine learning algorithm capable of accurately identifying patients with rheumatoid arthritis from format-free text fields in electronic health records. Methods: Two electronic health record data sets were employed: Leiden (n=3000) and Erlangen (n=4771). Using a portion of the Leiden data (n=2000), we compared 6 different machine learning methods and a naïve word-matching algorithm using 10-fold cross-validation. Performances were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC), and F1 score was used as the primary criterion for selecting the best method to build a classifying algorithm. We selected the optimal threshold of positive predictive value for case identification based on the output of the best method in the training data. This validation workflow was subsequently applied to a portion of the Erlangen data (n=4293). For testing, the best performing methods were applied to remaining data (Leiden n=1000; Erlangen n=478) for an unbiased evaluation. Results: For the Leiden data set, the word-matching algorithm demonstrated mixed performance (AUROC 0.90; AUPRC 0.33; F1 score 0.55), and 4 methods significantly outperformed word-matching, with support vector machines performing best (AUROC 0.98; AUPRC 0.88; F1 score 0.83). Applying this support vector machine classifier to the test data resulted in a similarly high performance (F1 score 0.81; positive predictive value [PPV] 0.94), and with this method, we could identify 2873 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in less than 7 seconds out of the complete collection of 23,300 patients in the Leiden electronic health record system. For the Erlangen data set, gradient boosting performed best (AUROC 0.94; AUPRC 0.85; F1 score 0.82) in the training set, and applied to the test data, resulted once again in good results (F1 score 0.67; PPV 0.97). Conclusions: We demonstrate that machine learning methods can extract the records of patients with rheumatoid arthritis from electronic health record data with high precision, allowing research on very large populations for limited costs. Our approach is language and center independent and could be applied to any type of diagnosis. We have developed our pipeline into a universally applicable and easy-to-implement workflow to equip centers with their own high-performing algorithm. This allows the creation of observational studies of unprecedented size covering different countries for low cost from already available data in electronic health record systems.	Maarseveen, TD.

2022-02-09	A framework for employing longitudinally collected multicenter electronic health records to stratify heterogeneous patient populations on disease history	JAMIA	Objective: To facilitate patient disease subset and risk factor identification by constructing a pipeline which is generalizable, provides easily interpretable results, and allows replication by overcoming electronic health records (EHRs) batch effects. Material and Methods: We used 1872 billing codes in EHRs of 102 880 patients from 12 healthcare systems. Using tools borrowed from single-cell omics, we mitigated center-specific batch effects and performed clustering to identify patients with highly similar medical history patterns across the various centers. Our visualization method (PheSpec) depicts the phenotypic profile of clusters, applies a novel filtering of noninformative codes (Ranked Scope Pervasion), and indicates the most distinguishing features. Results: We observed 114 clinically meaningful profiles, for example, linking prostate hyperplasia with cancer and diabetes with cardiovascular problems and grouping pediatric developmental disorders. Our framework identified disease subsets, exemplified by 6 “other headache” clusters, where phenotypic profiles suggested different underlying mechanisms: migraine, convulsion, injury, eye problems, joint pain, and pituitary gland disorders. Phenotypic patterns replicated well, with high correlations of at least 0.75 to an average of 6 (2–8) of the 12 different cohorts, demonstrating the consistency with which our method discovers disease history profiles. Discussion: Costly clinical research ventures should be based on solid hypotheses. We repurpose methods from single-cell omics to build these hypotheses from observational EHR data, distilling useful information from complex data. Conclusion: We establish a generalizable pipeline for the identification and replication of clinically meaningful (sub)phenotypes from widely available high-dimensional billing codes. This approach overcomes datatype problems and produces comprehensive visualizations of validation-ready phenotypes.	Maurits, MP. (2022).
