2015-10-29	Comparing Global Link Arrangements for Dragonfly Networks	2015 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing	"High-performance computing systems are shifting away from traditional interconnect topologies to exploit new technologies and to reduce interconnect power consumption. The Dragonfly topology is one promising candidate for new systems, with several variations already in production. It is hierarchical, with local links forming groups and global links joining the groups. At each level, the interconnect is a clique, with a link between each pair of switches in a group and a link between each pair of groups. This paper shows that the intergroup links can be made in meaningfully different ways. We evaluate three previously-proposed approaches for link organization (called global link arrangements) in two ways. First, we use bisection bandwidth, an important and commonly-used measure of the potential for communication bottlenecks. We show that the global link arrangements often give bisection bandwidths differing by 10s of percent, with the specific separation varying based on the relative bandwidths of local and global links. For the link bandwidths used in a current Dragonfly implementation, it is 33%. Second, we show that the choice of global link arrangement can greatly impact the regularity of task mappings for nearest neighbor stencil communication patterns, an important pattern in scientific applications."

The Effects of Team-Building Activities and Team Composition on Team Outcomes	Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction - CSCW	"How can instructors group students into teams that interact and learn effectively together? One strand of research advocates for grouping students into teams with ""good"" compositions such as skill diversity. Another strand argues for deploying team-building activities to foster interpersonal relations like psychological safety. Our work synthesizes these two strands of research. We describe an experiment (N=249) that compares how team composition vs. team-building activities affect student team outcomes. In two university courses, we composed student teams either randomly or using a criteria-based team formation tool. Teams further performed team-building activities that promoted either team or task outcomes. We collected project scores, and used surveys to measure psychological safety, perceived performance, and team satisfaction. Surprisingly, the criteria-based teams did not statistically differ from the random teams on any of the measures taken, despite having compositions that better satisfied the criteria defined by the instructor. Our findings argue that, for instructors deploying a team formation tool, creating an expectation among team members that their team can perform well is as important as tuning the criteria in the tool. We also found that student teams reported high levels of psychological safety, but these levels appeared to develop organically and were not affected by the activities or compositional strategies tested. We distill these and other findings into implications for the design and deployment of team formation tools for learning environments."	"Hastings, E.
