9/1/2011	Principal axes for stochastic dynamics	Phys. Rev. E	"We introduce a general procedure for directly ascertaining how many independent stochastic sources exist in a complex system modeled through a set of coupled Langevin equations of arbitrary dimension. We apply our algorithm to two examples of systems showing Hopf bifurcation. We argue it enables one to define vector fields of stochastic eigendirections which can be used assess the path of minimum stochastic forcing in phase space, increasing the predictability of the system."

We show that decisions within small groups under high risk and stringent requirements toward success significantly raise the chances of coordinating to save the planet's climate. We discuss both deterministic dynamics in infinite populations, and stochastic dynamics in finite populations."	Francisco C. Santos, Vítor V. Vasconcelos, Marta D. Santos, P. N. B. Neves, Jorge M.

7/14/2013	A bottom-up institutional approach to cooperative governance of risky commons	Nature Climate Change	"We investigate the emergence and impact of different types of sanctioning to deter non-cooperative behaviour in climate agreements. We show that a bottom-up approach, in which parties create local institutions that punish free-riders, promotes the emergence of widespread cooperation, mostly when risk perception is low, as it is at present. Global institutions provide, at best, marginal improvements regarding overall cooperation. Our results clearly suggest that a polycentric approach involving multiple institutions is more effective than that associated with a single, global one."	Vítor V. Vasconcelos, Francisco C.

11/2/2014	Climate policies under wealth inequality	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	"This paper incorporates wealth inequality into a public goods dilemma, including an asymmetric distribution of wealth representative of existing inequalities among nations. Without homophily (imitation of like agents), inequality actually makes cooperation easier to achieve; homophily, however, can undercut this, leading to collapse because poor agents may contribute less. Understanding such effects may enhance the ability to achieve agreements on climate change and other issues."	Vítor V. Vasconcelos, Francisco C. Santos, Jorge M. Pacheco, and Simon A. Levin.

31/12/2014	Climate change governance, cooperation and self-organization	Physics of Life Review	We introduce a simple approach to address dilemmas in which the risk of failure plays a central role in individual decisions. This model can be shown to capture some of the essential features discovered in recent key experiments, while allowing one to extend in non-trivial ways the experimental conditions to regions of more practical interest. Our results suggest that global coordination for a common good should be attempted by segmenting tasks in many small to medium sized groups, in which perception of risk is high and uncertainty in collective goals is minimized. Moreover, our results support the conclusion that sanctioning institutions may further enhance the chances of coordinating to tame the planet's climate, as long as they are implemented in a decentralized and polycentric manner."

9/30/2015	Incomplete cooperation and co-benefits: deepening climate cooperation with a proliferation of small agreements	Climatic Change	Case study and model results lend some optimism for the potential of small coalitions with partially excludable public goods to substantially deepen international cooperation on energy and climate issues. Drawing motivation from other issue areas in international relations ranging from nuclear non-proliferation, transboundary air pollution and liberalized trade, we use an evolutionary-game-theoretic model to analyze regimes that yield domestic incentives to contribute to public goods provision (co-benefits). Co-benefits may be limited, but can create a nucleus for formation of coalitions that grow while deepening provision of global public goods. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) is a prime example of an agreement that employs partially excludable club benefits to deepen cooperation on non-CO2 greenhouse gases. This paper lends positive support that a proliferation of small agreements under a building blocks approach at the UNFCCC may be more effective (not just more likely) for deepening climate change cooperation than a fully inclusive approach.

12/15/2015	Cooperation dynamics of polycentric climate governance	M3AS	We review a stochastic model which incorporates a threshold game of collective action and the idea of risky goods, capturing essential features unveiled in recent experiments. We show how reducing uncertainty both in terms of the perception of disaster and in terms of goals induce a transition to cooperation. Taking into account wealth inequality, we explore the impact of the homophily, potentially present in the network of influence of the rich and the poor, in the different contributions of the players. Finally, we discuss the impact of polycentric sanctioning institutions, showing how such a scenario also proves to be more efficient than a single global institution.	Vítor V.

2/1/2017	Stochastic dynamics through hierarchically embedded Markov chains	Phys. Rev. Lett.	We develop a framework that allows us to define a hierarchy of approximations to the stationary distribution of general systems that can be described as discrete Markov processes with time invariant transition probabilities and (possibly) a large number of states. This results in an efficient method for studying social and biological communities in the presence of stochastic effects—such as mutations in evolutionary dynamics and a random exploration of choices in social systems—including situations where the dynamics encompasses the existence of stable polymorphic configurations, thus overcoming the limitations of existing methods. The present formalism is shown to be general in scope, widely applicable, and of relevance to a variety of interdisciplinary problems.	Vítor V. Vasconcelos, Fernando P. Santos, Francisco C.

07/23/2018	Stability and recovery of coral-algae systems: the importance of recruitment seasonality and grazing influence	Theoretical Ecology	we use a model of coral-macroalgae dynamics to explore the effects of different assumptions regarding grazing and coral recruitment seasonality in coral-algae systems. We find that the grazing functional form constrains the potential for alternative stable states and coexistence, highlighting the need to further elucidate herbivore dynamics on reef systems. We also show that coral recruitment from external sources facilitates coral persistence and recovery, both when recruitment is assumed to be constant over time, and when recruitment occurs seasonally. In systems with alternative stable states, the total number of larvae that reaches a patch is the primary driver that dictates whether a system with low coral cover can flip into the coral-dominated basin of attraction. However, in a limited parameter space, the duration and timing of this larval pulse can also determine whether coral can recover in a bistable system. These results highlight the multiple factors that influence whether a coral reef is likely to remain in its present state or not, especially as ocean conditions change.	Lisa C. McManus, James R.

12/17/2018	Simple property of heterogeneous aspiration dynamics: Beyond weak selection	Phys. Rev. E	We investigate whether and how heterogeneity in the rules of behavior update alters the evolutionary outcome. We assume that individuals update behaviors by aspiration-based self-evaluation and they do so in their own ways. Under weak selection, we analytically reveal a simple property that holds for any two-strategy multiplayer games in well-mixed populations and on regular graphs: the evolutionary outcome in a population with heterogeneous update rules is the weighted average of the outcomes in the corresponding homogeneous populations, and the associated weights are the frequencies of each update rule in the heterogeneous population. Beyond weak selection, we show that this property holds for public goods games. Our finding implies that heterogeneous aspiration dynamics is additive. This additivity greatly reduces the complexity induced by the underlying individual heterogeneity. Our work thus provides an efficient method to calculate evolutionary outcomes under heterogeneous update rules.	Lei Zhou, Bin Wu, Vítor V. Vasconcelos, and Long Wang.

5/6/2019	Consensus and polarization in competing complex contagion processes	J. Roy. Soc. Interface	The rate of adoption of new information depends on reinforcement from multiple sources in a way that often cannot be described by simple contagion processes. In such cases, contagion is said to be complex. Complex contagion happens in the diffusion of human behaviours, innovations and knowledge. Based on that evidence, we propose a model that considers multiple, potentially asymmetric and competing contagion processes and analyse its respective population-wide dynamics, bringing together ideas from complex contagion, opinion dynamics, evolutionary game theory and language competition by shifting the focus from individuals to the properties of the diffusing processes. We show that our model spans a dynamical space in which the population exhibits patterns of consensus, dominance, and, importantly, different types of polarization, a more diverse dynamical environment that contrasts with single simple contagion processes. We show how these patterns emerge and how different population structures modify them through a natural development of spatial correlations: structured interactions increase the range of the dominance regime by reducing that of dynamic polarization, tight modular structures can generate structural polarization, depending on the interplay between fundamental properties of the processes and the modularity of the interaction network.
