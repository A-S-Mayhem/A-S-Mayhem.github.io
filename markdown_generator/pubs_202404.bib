abstract={Soft building blocks, such as micelles, cells or soap bubbles, tend to adopt near-spherical geometry when densely packed together. As a result, their packing structures do not extend beyond those discovered in metallic glasses, quasicrystals and crystals. Here we report the emergence of two Frank--Kasper phases from the self-assembly of five-fold symmetric molecular pentagons. The $\mu$ phase, an important intermediate in superalloys, is indexed in soft matter, whereas the ϕ phase exhibits a structure distinct from known Frank--Kasper phases in metallic systems. We find a broad size and shape distribution of self-assembled mesoatoms formed by molecular pentagons while approaching equilibrium that contribute to the unique packing structures. This work provides insight into the manipulation of soft building blocks that deviate from the typical spherical geometry and opens avenues for the fabrication of `soft alloy' structures that were previously unattainable in metal alloys.},

abstract = {Lithium-metal batteries, owing to their remarkable energy density, represent a promising solution for future energy storage needs. However, the widespread adoption of lithium-metal batteries has been impeded by the inherent instability that exists between lithium metal and traditional liquid lithium electrolytes, initially designed for graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries. Recent insights underscore the efficacy of electrolyte engineering as a strategic avenue to realize the potential of lithium-metal batteries. A notable approach involves the fluorination of solvent molecules, particularly those of the ether class. Nonetheless, a comprehensive understanding of the various factors governing solvent molecular design remains elusive. Here, we examine four solvents derived from 1,2-dimethoxylethane (DME) via molecular dynamics simulation. These solvents are engineered with the introduction of additional alkyl groups or through fluorination. We particularly scrutinize two critical facets: steric effects, arising from the incorporation of bulkier alkyl chains, and electronic effects, originating from fluorination. Our inquiry delves deeply into the stability, ion transport characteristics, and solvation behavior exhibited by these five distinct solvents. Our study underscores the profound impact of adjusting the steric and electronic attributes of solvent molecules on Li+ solvation behavior. This, in turn, influences the coordination strength and the mode of association between Li+ and solvation sites within the first solvation shell, providing key insights into the disparities in ion transport properties within electrolytes.}

    abstract = "{A biological potassium channel is \\&gt;1000 times more permeable to K+ than to Na+ and exhibits a giant permeation rate of ∼108 ions/s. It is a great challenge to construct artificial potassium channels with such high selectivity and ion conduction rate. Herein, we unveil a long-overlooked structural feature that underpins the ultra-high K+/Na+ selectivity. By carrying out massive molecular dynamics simulation for ion transport through carbonyl-oxygen-modified bi-layer graphene nanopores, we find that the twisted carbonyl rings enable strict potassium selectivity with a dynamic K+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 1295 and a K+ conduction rate of 3.5 × 107 ions/s, approaching those of the biological counterparts. Intriguingly, atomic trajectories of K+ permeation events suggest a dual-ion transport mode, i.e. two like-charged potassium ions are successively captured by the nanopores in the graphene bi-layer and are interconnected by sharing one or two interlayer water molecules. The dual-ion behavior allows rapid release of the exiting potassium ion via a soft knock-on mechanism, which has previously been found only in biological ion channels. As a proof-of-concept utilization of this discovery, we propose a novel way for ionic power generation by mixing KCl and NaCl solutions through the bi-layer graphene nanopores, termed potassium-permselectivity enabled osmotic power generation (PoPee-OPG). Theoretically, the biomimetic device achieves a very high power density of \\&gt;1000 W/m2 with graphene sheets of \\&lt;1\\% porosity. This study provides a blueprint for artificial potassium channels and thus paves the way toward next-generation electric-eel-mimetic ionic power generation.}",

abstract = {Abstract The electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are plagued by a low Li+ transference number (T+) of conventional lithium salts and inability to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we synthesized a self-folded lithium salt, lithium 2-[2-(2-methoxy ethoxy)ethoxy]ethanesulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiETFSI), and comparatively studied with its structure analogue, lithium 1,1,1-trifluoro-N-[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)]ethyl]methanesulfonamide (LiFEA). The special anion chemistry imparts the following new characteristics: i) In both LiFEA and LiETFSI, the ethylene oxide moiety efficiently captures Li+, resulting in a self-folded structure and high T+ around 0.8. ii) For LiFEA, a Li−N bond (2.069 Å) is revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction, indicating that the FEA anion possesses a high donor number (DN) and thus an intensive interphase “self-cleaning” function for an ultra-thin and compact SEI. iii) Starting from LiFEA, an electron-withdrawing sulfone group is introduced near the N atom. The distance of Li−N is tuned from 2.069 Å in LiFEA to 4.367 Å in LiETFSI. This alteration enhances ionic separation, achieves a more balanced DN, and tunes the self-cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of LMBs is progressively improved. This rationally tuned anion chemistry reshapes the interactions among Li+, anions, and solvents, presenting new prospects for advanced LMBs.}
