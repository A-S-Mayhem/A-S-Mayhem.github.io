0,1/9/2023,Extending seismic bandwidth using the harmonic energy of a marine vibrator source ,IMAGE2023,"In  vibrator  technology,  the  presence  of  harmonics  is  a  common  phenomenon.  Several  authors  considered the problem of removing or utilizing harmonics from land vibrator data. However, marine vibrator (MV) harmonics are rarely discussed.  Although much weaker than the fundamental signal, we show that the MV harmonics can in principle be successfully used for broadening the frequency band of interest for subsurface imaging. Utilization is enabled by a highly reliable MV source capable of producing high-fidelity repeatable sweeps and by a high-fidelity source signature estimator. ","Tiexing Wang et al. (2023).

,4/11/2024,What Can Generative Modelling Do for Interpolation of Extremely Sparse Wind Farm Seismic Data,GET2024,"Traditionally, site surveys for wind farms are conducted using a grid of ultra-high resolution (UHR) 2D seismic lines, which provide data along specific profiles to support site investigations by mapping stratigraphic units across a survey area and aiding in the identification and localization of shallow hazards. There is also a need for re-siting wind farms and building subsurface models, which requires seismic data beyond the 2D UHR lines. However, these 2D UHR lines leave significant gaps between them, limiting the potential to make greater use of UHR data by filling these gaps through interpolation. This is a challenging task, as the gaps can range from hundreds of meters to several kilometers. Encouraged by the significant success of modern deep learning techniques in various seismic processing tasks, we investigate this specific challenge of extreme sparsity in UHR seismic data using generative modelling (specifically diffusion models) and classical supervised learning (based on U-Net and ResNet). The training and validation data are from UHR data acquired in the German North Sea planned for offshore wind development. The preliminary results show that when irregular missing data is up to 90%, the diffusion model outperforms U-Net and ResNet in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).","Tiexing Wang et al.

,19/11/2024, Advancements in Seismic Data Acquisition and Processing The First Broadband 3D Marine Vibrator Survey in the North Sea,Petex2024,"We present the results of the processing and imaging of marine vibrator (MV) alpha test data recently acquired at the Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea. The alpha test includes a 3D survey using a single MV across a frequency spectrum of 3-150Hz and additional testing of several 2D source-lines using two MVs. Moreover, two ultra-low frequency (ULF) test lines were conducted over a 1-8Hz frequency range. The preliminary processing results of the 3D survey are on par with those derived from the legacy airgun array acquisition, thereby affirming the viability of employing MV technology on a large scale.","Tiexing Wang et al.
