<p>Disco Zoo is a zoo simulation video game developed by Milkbag Games and published by NimbleBit for iOS and Android.In the game, you go on rescue missions to save animals and expand your zoo. On each rescue mission, you are given a 5x5 grid, and between 1 and 3 animals to find. Each animal has an associated pattern, and you have 10 tries to find all the animals.</p>
<p>In this project I am exploring how to determine all possible layouts given a set of input animals, how to best assign values to animals in order to optimize moves, and how to weigh the value of information as you progress from your first move to your final move. 
This work is currently in python, wrapped in an R Markdown for ease of viewing.</p>
