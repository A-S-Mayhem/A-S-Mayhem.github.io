<p>Mentorship programs are a great way for young new employees to learn from their more experienced colleagues, 
but it is also a great way for more seasoned employees to widen their perspective. The compatability and matching of mentors/mentees is 
  an important, but often neglected part of the program design.</p>
<p>In this project I explore various methods of matching mentors to mentees, given
  information on the compatability measure between the mentor/mentee pairs. (I leave the project of determining
  an appropriate method of scoring compatability for another day). My current method is to minimize loss of not getting 
  your top preference. Work is still needed to be done on alternative methods and how to compare them. The method of measuring
  success also needs to be defined. Do I look at overall satisfaction/compatability or should I instead look at the average compatability?
  Is it better to have a handful of very well matched individuals and several poor matches, or consistently average matches? Variance and 
  range of matches should be considered. This work is currently in python, wrapped in an R Markdown for ease of viewing.</p>
