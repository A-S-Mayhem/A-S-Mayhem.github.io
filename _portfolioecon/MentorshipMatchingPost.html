title: "Work in Progress: Comparing methods of Mentorship Matching"
excerpt: "Mentorship programs are a great way for young new employees to learn from their more experienced colleagues, 
but it is also a great way for more seasoned employees to widen their perspective. The compatability of mentors/mentees is therefore
an important part of the program design."

<p>In this project I use python to explore various methods of matching mentors to mentees, assuming we are given
a spreadsheet containing the compatability measure between the mentor/mentee pairs. (I leave the project of determining
an appropriate method of scoring compatability for another day). My current method is to minimize loss of not getting 
your top preference. Work is still needed to be done on alternative methods and how to compare them. The method of measuring
success also needs to be defined. Do I look at overall satisfaction/compatability or should I instead look at the average? Should
I look at the range? There are a lot of questions still surrounding this work, but that is why it is interesting.</p>
