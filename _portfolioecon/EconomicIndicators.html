title: "Work in Progress: Macroeconomic Variables and Recessions"
excerpt: "The choice of macroeconomic variables in default and delinquency mortgage models is important. In order to better understand 
trends during periods of stress, I am buidling data visualizations and experimenting with lags/transformations of these indicators. This 
is an in progress project and will continue to be updated."

<p>This project is all about understanding macroeconomic indicators and their relationship to periods of economic stress. In particular, I'm
  interested to understand if there are differences in trends between recession periods and if there are well defined relationships between
  different indicators. This project is in progress, and will continue to be updated. I intend to transform/lag the indicators to determine 
  how to best extract information from them; I also intend to build more robust visualizations/interactive visualizations to allow users to 
  more fully engage with the data; and finally I am in the process of performing a literautre review--currently focused on the role of 
  unemployment in mortgage default/delinquency models, but with the possibility of opening it up to other macroeconomic indicators and 
  models of prepayment. All of my data/code can be found in the github repository from the link below. Feel free to use my content, but 
  please cite this website. If you have questions or comments, feel free to email me. I'd be happy to geek out about macroeconomic 
  indicators with you. </p>
