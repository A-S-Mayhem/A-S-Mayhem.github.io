Presented a 30 minute presentation as part of the PHY660 course, where I covered by attempts in simulating self-focusing in nonlinear optics. Click to see slides and future development.

See below for the slides used for the presentation. I am working on extending the code, you can access in here: [NLO repository](https://github.com/ArnavMetrani/Self-Focusing).
