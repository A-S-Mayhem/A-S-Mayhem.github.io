This year at ICT.Open, I did not only present [a preliminary overview of my dissertation](https://latower.github.io/publication/2022-09-01-Optimal-decision-making-under-constraints-and-uncertainty-dissertation), I also competed in the Elevator Research Pitch competition. Read all about how that went in my [blog post](https://latower.github.io/posts/2019/04/can-we-fix-it/) about the topic.
