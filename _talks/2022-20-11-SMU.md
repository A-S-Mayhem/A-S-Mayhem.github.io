This talk will present an overview of our research on automated *software validation* (SV), i.e., methods/tools to support developers during software testing and debugging activities. The talk will present our application of *input grammars* for testing (a) the *correctness* of traditional software systems (e.g.,  compilers/interpreters like Mozilla Rhino and Google's Closure) and (b) the *fairness properties* of Machine Learning based systems (e.g., NLP systems like Google BERT, StanfordNLP and AllenNLP). Finally, the talk will outline our ongoing work on building intelligent (or data-centric) SV methods, human-in-the-loop SV methods, and SV methods for interdisciplinary software systems.
