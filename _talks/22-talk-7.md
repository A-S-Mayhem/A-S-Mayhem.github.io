Ambient noise interferometry utilizes the cross-correlations of ambient sound to estimate the time domain Green&apos;s function (TDGF). We have previously shown that ambient noise interferometry can resolve multi-path arrivals between two bottom-mounted hydrophones separated by 3.2 km, at a depth of 1500 m, and located 470 km off the Oregon coast. In 2019, a seismic reflection survey was conducted directly over the two hydrophones for 28 days covering a 763 km2 area. The airgun shots occurred every 37.5 m while the ship moved at a speed of _4.5 knots, equivalent to a shooting interval of 16 s. The hydrophone recordings during this survey provide the unique opportunity to understand the effects of the surface source distribution on the noise cross correlation function (NCCF). In this talk, we show the sensitivity of the NCCF to the surface source locations using simulated and experimental data. Then, we use the image source method to analytically define the location of the sound sources that contribute to different delay times in the NCCF. [Work supported by ONR.]
