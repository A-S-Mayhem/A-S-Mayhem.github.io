title: "Can abatement efforts in a CPR promote over-exploitation of the resource?"
collection: research
permalink: 
excerpt: 'We examine a common pool resource (CPR) where appropriations deteriorate the quality of the
resource and, thus, its impact on the exploitation of the CPR. We focus on two settings: (i) firms
use the CPR without abatement efforts, and (ii) abatement is allowed. We provide comparisons
between these two settings and identify socially optimal appropriation levels. We find that
(i) higher quality of the CPR could induce firms to overuse the resource and (ii) first-period
appropriations with abatement decrease in the regeneration rate. However, abatement induces
an overuse of the resource when the quality of the CPR improves.'
