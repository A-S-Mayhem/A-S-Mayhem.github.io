"FourConnect," also known as "Connect Four," is a classic two-player connection game that involves strategy and critical thinking. The objective of the game is to be the first player to connect four of your own colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a grid. I used AI algorithms such Minmax and Monte Carlo Search Tree to build an agent in order to play with.
