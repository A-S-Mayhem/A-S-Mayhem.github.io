Trend filtering is a nonparametric regression model producing piecewise polynomial estimation. Trend filtering has an ell_1 penalty, regularizing recursively divided differences of neighboring parameters. It can be written as a convex optimization problem and solved by many generic algorithms. However, these generic algorithms may be computationally complex. This seminar will focus on a couple of specialized algorithms (linearized alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal Newton method) for efficient computation especially for large-scaleÂ problems. These specialized algorithms are in the regime of proximal algorithms [(Parikh and Boyd, 2013)](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/prox_algs.pdf).
