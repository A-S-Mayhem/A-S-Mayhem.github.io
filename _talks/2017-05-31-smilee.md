I presented our paper, [Combining Stochastic Constraint Optimization and Probabilistic Programming](https://latower.github.io/publication/2017-01-01-Combining-Stochastic-Constraint-Optimization-and-Probabilistic-Programming--From-Knowledge-Compilation-to-Constraint-Solving), during the Smilee workshop. This invitation-only event was hosted and organised by the DTAI (Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence) group at KU Leuven, and took place in May 2017, in Ostend, Belgium.
