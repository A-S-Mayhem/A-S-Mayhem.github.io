In 3D fluid dynamics, the Stokes equation offers good approximation to low-Reynold's number flow dynamics. However, the solution to Stokes equation breaks down when evaluated at large distances. For example, uniform steady Stokes flow past a sphere calculated from Stokes equation does not satisfy the far-field boundary condition in the second order, as the Reynold's number diminishes. This is the Whitehead paradox. The low-Reynold's number steady state incompressible Navier-Stokes equation can be considered as a perturbation problem, where the unperturbed problem is the Stokes equation. In the aforementioned problem, we can consider flow near the surface of the sphere as a boundary layer, and the uniform flow as the outer layer. We can now find a second order uniform approximation -- a solution that satisfies the far-field boundary condition as well as conditions on the surface of the sphere. This is the Oseen approximation.
