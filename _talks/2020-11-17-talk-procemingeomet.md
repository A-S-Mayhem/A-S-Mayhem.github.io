The topic
======

Due to the pandemic, the realization of face-to-face conferences has been paused this year.

In this context, Procemin Geomet 2020 has decided that the oral talks associated with the conference will be delivered asynchronously.

For Procemin Geomeet 2020, the ALGES team prepared a conference paper describing a preliminary version of a hierarchical regressor based on hyperspectral data for the estimation of geometallurgical variables.

In this preliminary version, a random effects model is considered to establish a hierarchical organization of the spectral variability of the data.

This talk corresponds to the general description of this conference article.
