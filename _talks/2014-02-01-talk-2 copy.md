My research project investigates the remarkable similarities between human swimming strokes and the locomotion of aquatic animals, offering a deeper understanding of biomechanics and fluid dynamics. I explored how creatures like North American river otters, ghost knifefish, and African clawed frogs exhibit swimming patterns that parallel human strokes such as butterfly, backstroke, and breaststroke. By using video analysis, physics trackers, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), I tracked the undulatory and oscillatory movements of both humans and animals, discovering shared efficiency strategies like the otterâ€™s dorsoventral undulations resembling the butterfly stroke.

Building on these insights, I aim to extend my research by creating 3D models to compare the anatomical and hydrodynamic features of human limbs and aquatic adaptations, such as webbed otter paws. Using tools like Simflow, I plan to quantify variables like drag and Reynolds numbers to deepen our knowledge of bioinspired designs in swimming. This interdisciplinary project bridges biology, physics, and engineering, illuminating how nature inspires human innovation.
