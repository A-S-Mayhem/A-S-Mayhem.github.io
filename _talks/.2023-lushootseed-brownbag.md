Many Indigenous languages are endangered, and revitalizing them is a major part of decolonization. Educational technology may be able to help, but the unique needs of Indigenous communities need to be taken into account. In this talk, I describe my experience with the Lushootseed language as a case study to explore these challenges and opportunities. Lushootseed is a Coast Salish language from the territory around the modern city of Seattle.
