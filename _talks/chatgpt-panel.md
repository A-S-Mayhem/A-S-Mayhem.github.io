I shared my perspective, focusing on critical theory and scholars who have been questioning language models for a long time, like Emily Bender who was recently [profiled in this great articles](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html).
It uses very accessible language, while also retaining a lot of the nuance in Bender's stance. I ended by incorporating a technoskeptical perspective, taken from [Civics of Technology's curriculum](https://www.civicsoftechnology.org/curriculum).
I wanted to build on a question that came up in a breakout room along these lines of "Who is harmed and who benefits from the technology?" In this case, who benefits and is harmed by chatbots like ChatGPT?
