Employing an half-wave plate (HWP) as polarization modulator is a promising strategy to mitigate systematics in CMB experiments. However, if not calibrated or accounted for correctly in the analysis, its non-idealities represent an additional source of systematics, which can impact the science extracted from CMB. In this talk, I'll show how their effect on the observed angular power spectra is partially degenerate with cosmic birefringence. Also, I'll discuss how this issue intertwines with the study of foregrounds, given the frequency dependence of the HWP behaviour.
