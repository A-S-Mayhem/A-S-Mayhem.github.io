With deep oceans absorbing most of the additional heat due to human caused climate change, it is important to be able to monitor the deep ocean. Can ambient sound be used as a tool to monitor the deep ocean? Coherent ambient sound can contain a lot of useful information about the environment that the sound is propagating in. If the distribution of sound sources is favorable, you can even estimate the Green&apos;s function between two sensors using just ambient coherent sound. The Green&apos;s function estimate could then be used to infer oceanographic variables. This technique is called ambient noise interferometry. In this talk, long-term acoustic data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative is used to explore the possibilities of using ambient noise interferometry in the deep ocean for long-term ocean monitoring.
