## Introduction 

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jets are a highly promising technology in numerous industrial applications, including inkjet printing, spray coating, fuel injection, and others. Therefore, an accurate prediction of droplet size and distribution is essential for the advancement of this technology. However, these predictions are hindered by an insufficient understanding of many aspects of its flow mechanisms, such as whipping behaviour.

## Govening Equations

The governing equations needed to solve the two isothermal, incompressible, and immiscible fluids are continuity, momentum, and the interface advection equations. The numerical simulation methodology for the EHD jet is implemented in OpenFOAM, that includes a fine-volume method (FVM) based solver, where the governing equations are applied.  An important detail is the method for interface tracking, which in our case is the geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) method. With this method, only one scalar, $\alpha$, is defined to represent the liquid and gas phases and, in the end, the sum of the volume fraction is equal to one. An overview of the governing equations is given below.

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}  = 0 ,$$

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left(\rho \mathbf{u} \right)+  \nabla \cdot \left(\rho\mathbf{u} \mathbf{u} \right)= -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^{2} \mathbf{u} + \rho \mathbf{g} +\mathbf{f}_{\gamma}+\mathbf{f}_{e} ,$$

$$\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot(\alpha \vec{u})=0 .$$

where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, composed for a Cartesian coordinate system by the three components, $u_{x}$, $u_{y}$ and $u_{z}$. We are considering a flow with a mass density $\rho$, a dynamic viscosity $\mu$, a local fluid pressure $p$ and subjected to a gravitational acceleration $ {\mathbf{g}}$. In this case into the source term of the momentum, we added the force due to the surface tension $\mathbf{f}{\gamma}$ and one due to the external imposed electric field, as $\mathbf{f}{e}$.

In addition to the hidrodynamic governing equations, we also consider the conservation of electric charge density ($\rho_e$). This equation accounts for the distribution and transport of electric charges as,

$$\frac{\partial \rho_{e}}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot\left(\rho_{e} \mathbf{u}  \right) + \nabla \cdot (\sigma \mathbf{E}) = 0 $$


## Results

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
Recent developments have been made towards achieving a fully coupled numerical simulation of three-dimensional electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jet flow. This simulation allows for the study of the nonsymmetric effects that govern most EHD regimes. Our simulations employ numerical methods such as the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method and the Finite Volume Method (FVM), along with the implementation of Maxwell’s equations for electrostatics within the governing equations of fluid dynamics based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The simulations explore the influence of various parameters on the whipping and atomization processes, including electric field strength, liquid flow rate, and fluid properties.
