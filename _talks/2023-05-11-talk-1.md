Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jets are a highly promising technology in numerous industrial applications, including inkjet printing, spray coating, fuel injection, and others. Therefore, an accurate prediction of droplet size and distribution is essential for the advancement of this technology. However, these predictions are hindered by an insufficient understanding of many aspects of its flow mechanisms, such as whipping behaviour.

Recent developments have been made towards achieving a fully coupled numerical simulation of three-dimensional electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jet flow. This simulation allows for the study of the nonsymmetric effects that govern most EHD regimes. Our simulations employ numerical methods such as the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method and the Finite Volume Method (FVM), along with the implementation of Maxwell’s equations for electrostatics within the governing equations of fluid dynamics based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The simulations explore the influence of various parameters on the whipping and atomization processes, including electric field strength, liquid flow rate, and fluid properties.
