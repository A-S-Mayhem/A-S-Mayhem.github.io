I obtained a grant of 1500 EUR to participate in the congress. The research is co-authored with Bruno Seminario and María Alejandra Zegarra. The research will be presented at the symposium <b>New economic growth indicators for Latin America in the long term</b> coordinated by Juan Ignacio Pérez (Universidad de Chile, Chile), André Hofman (Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Chile) y José Díaz (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Chile).
