Summary: Human neuroscience research has been increasingly dominated by imaging experiments, that are usually insufficient to inform about the underlying mechanisms at play behind the observed neural phenomena unfolding at different spatial and temporal scales. In addition, since ethical considerations severely limit direct causal manipulation of human brain activity, most of the neuroimaging literature is limited to correlational studies. An important complement to this research is provided by Whole-Brain Models.
