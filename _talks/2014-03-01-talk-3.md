Diffusion models are a type of generative model used in machine learning and statistics. They are designed to capture the dynamics of how data evolves over time through a process of gradual diffusion or spread. These models are particularly useful for modeling complex distributions, such as images or time series data.\n
At a high level, diffusion models work by iteratively transforming an initial sample (usually random noise) into the desired data distribution through a sequence of steps. Each step involves adding a controlled amount of noise to the current sample, making it gradually resemble the target distribution. This iterative process continues until the final generated sample is sufficiently close to the desired distribution.
This is a basic implementation of diffusion models which has a lot of room to be improved.
