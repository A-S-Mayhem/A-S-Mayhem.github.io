This research explores the potential of Pseudomonas bacteria to biodegrade low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a plastic widely used in products like shopping bags and plastic wraps. Recognizing the environmental challenges posed by plastic pollution, particularly in marine ecosystems, the project investigates whether specific Pseudomonas strains can utilize LDPE as a carbon source. The methodology included incubating LDPE with different bacterial strains, monitoring biofilm formation, measuring weight loss, and analyzing surface deformation over 120 days. Results revealed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other strains could break down LDPE, as evidenced by biofilm growth, structural changes, and up to 20% weight reduction, highlighting their potential in reducing plastic waste.

The study underscores the promise of leveraging bacterial biodegradation to address marine plastic pollution. It also opens avenues for future research, such as optimizing the process by exploring enzyme mechanisms and understanding the ecological impact on local microbial communities. This project reflects an innovative step toward sustainable solutions for one of the world's most pressing environmental issues.
