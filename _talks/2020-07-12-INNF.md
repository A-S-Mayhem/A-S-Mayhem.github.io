Deep neural network classifiers suffer from adversarial vulnerability: well-crafted, unnoticeable changes to the input data can affect the classifier decision. In this regard, the study of powerful adversarial attacks can help shed light on sources of this malicious behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack using normalizing flows. We show how an adversary can be found by searching over a pre-trained flow-based model base distribution. This way, we can generate adversaries that resemble the original data closely as the perturbations are in the shape of the data. We then demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed approach against well-known black-box adversarial attack methods.
