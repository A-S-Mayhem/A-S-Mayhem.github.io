I presented our paper, [A Propagator for Stochastic Constraints on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams](https://latower.github.io/publication/2018-07-01-Stochastic-Constraint-Optimization-using-Propagation-on-Ordered-Binary-Decision-Diagrams), at the invitation-only Fluffy workshop, hosted and organised by the DTAI (Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence) group at KU Leuven, Beligum.
