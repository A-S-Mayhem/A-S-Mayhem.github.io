Overcoming poor readout is an increasingly urgent challenge for devices based on solid-state spin defects, particularly given their rapid adoption in quantum sensing, quantum information, and tests of fundamental physics. In spite of experimental progress in very specific systems, solid-state spin sensors lack a universal, high-fidelity readout technique.

In this talk, Eisenach discusses how he and fellow researchers leverage strong coupling between an ensemble of solid-state spins and a dielectric microwave cavity for high-fidelity, room-temperature readout of nitrogen-vacancy centers. Using this strong collective interaction, they probe the spin ensemble’s microwave transition directly, overcoming the optical photon shot noise limitations of conventional fluorescence readout. Furthermore, they apply this technique to magnetometry, and show magnetic sensitivity approaching the Johnson–Nyquist noise limit of the system.
