I presented the tutorial within the context of [State of the R](https://stateofther.netlify.app/#hero), a group of researchers and engineers who come together to deepen their expertise, enhance the dissemination of their statistical methods, and exchange ideas on the latest innovations in R and RStudio, as well as other useful tools.

### Summary

The R `{terra}` package is designed for managing geospatial data, both vector and raster. It allows storing these data as objects of type SpatVector for vector data and SpatRaster for raster data. Our main objective is to manipulate these raster (SpatRaster) and vector (SpatVector) data using the functions provided by this package. In this session, we will work with altitude data from Luxembourg.
