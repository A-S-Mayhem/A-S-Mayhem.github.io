Biases and gaps are common on biodiversity data, which can have serious consequences on ecological and conservation research and actions, as it can lead to misconstrued hypotheses and incorrect conclusions. This talk, presented at the Annual Symposium of the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science, was about the incompleteness of digital biodiversity data at the Atlantic Rainforest and which environmental variables are correlated to it.
