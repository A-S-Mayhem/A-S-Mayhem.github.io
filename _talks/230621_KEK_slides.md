<p style="line-height:0.85"><small><b>Abstract:</b> The use of half-wave plates (HWPs) as a polarization modulators is a promising strategy to mitigate systematics in CMB experiments. However, if not calibrated well enough or correctly accounted for in the analysis, their non-idealities represent an additional source of systematics that can affect the science extracted from the polarization of the CMB. In this talk I will present a simple analytical model that allows to propagate their effects on the observed maps and I will discuss some implications for the measured cosmic birefringence angle and tensor-to-scalar ratio.</small></p>
