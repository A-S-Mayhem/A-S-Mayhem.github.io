excerpt: 'This study investigates the impact of women’s empowerment on individual well-being in

livestock-dependent households, specifically focusing on East Coast Fever (ECF) management

among women in Kenya. Utilizing a lab-in-field experiment based on the Women’s Empowerment

Livestock Index (WELI), the research examines how decision-making autonomy and control over

livestock-related income influence vaccination decisions and economic outcomes. Participants

are randomized into groups reflecting different levels of empowerment and then engage in a

multi-stage game simulating real-life decision-making processes. Results indicate that women

who hold both ownership rights to cows and the milk income received from them vaccinate more

cows and achieve higher payoff, compared to those who control only milk income. These results

highlight the critical role of resource control in enhancing decision-making efficacy and economic

well-being. The findings suggest that policies promoting joint ownership and income rights to

empower women, may improve livestock management practices and ensure economic stability.'
