title: "Seminar on Advances in Modelling the Atomization of Electrohydrodynamic Jets"
collection: talks
type: "Talk"
excerpt: "Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jets are vital in numerous applications, from inkjet printing to fuel injection, necessitating accurate predictions of droplet size and distribution for technological progress. The task is challenging due to complex flow dynamics, especially the whipping behavior that complicates forecasting. Recent advancements have been made through coupled three-dimensional simulations that integrate the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics with Maxwell’s equations for electrostatics. This approach has showed the influence of electric fields on jet atomization processes, and the formation of Taylor cones, as well as the impact of liquid charges. This presentation aims to detail these contribution to understanding EHD jet atomization and their potential to improve industrial application efficiency.

## Introduction 

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jets are a highly promising technology in numerous industrial applications, including inkjet printing, spray coating, fuel injection, and others. Therefore, an accurate prediction of droplet size and distribution is essential for the advancement of this technology. However, these predictions are hindered by an insufficient understanding of many aspects of its flow mechanisms, such as whipping behaviour.

## Govening Equations

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The governing equations needed to solve the two isothermal, incompressible, and immiscible fluids are continuity, momentum, and the interface advection equations. Our simulations employ numerical methods such as the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method and the Finite Volume Method (FVM), along with the implementation of Maxwell’s equations for electrostatics within the governing equations of fluid dynamics based on the Navier-Stokes equations.An important detail is the method for interface tracking, which in our case is the geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) method. With this method, only one scalar, $\alpha$, is defined to represent the liquid and gas phases and, in the end, the sum of the volume fraction is equal to one. An overview of the governing equations is given below.

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}  = 0 ,$$

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left(\rho \mathbf{u} \right)+  \nabla \cdot \left(\rho\mathbf{u} \mathbf{u} \right)= -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^{2} \mathbf{u} + \rho \mathbf{g} +\mathbf{f}_{\gamma}+\mathbf{f}_{e} ,$$

$$\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot(\alpha \vec{u})=0 .$$

<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, composed for a Cartesian coordinate system by the three components, $u_{x}$, $u_{y}$ and $u_{z}$. We are considering a flow with a mass density $\rho$, a dynamic viscosity $\mu$, a local fluid pressure $p$ and subjected to a gravitational acceleration $ {\mathbf{g}}$. In this case into the source term of the momentum, we added the force due to the surface tension $\mathbf{f}{\gamma}$ and one due to the external imposed electric field, as $\mathbf{f}{e}$.

In addition to the hidrodynamic governing equations, we also consider the conservation of electric charge density ($\rho_e$). This equation accounts for the distribution and transport of electric charges as,

$$\frac{\partial \rho_{e}}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot\left(\rho_{e} \mathbf{u}  \right) + \nabla \cdot (\sigma \mathbf{E}) = 0 $$
