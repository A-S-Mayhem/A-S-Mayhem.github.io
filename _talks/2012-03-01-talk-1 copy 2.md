title: "Willingness to pay for ITM vaccine using BDM mechanism."
collection: research
permalink: 
excerpt: 'This study examines how external budget constraints influence the willingness to pay (WTP) for vaccines against East Coast Fever (ECF) among cattle owners in Narok, Kenya. Utilizing the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) method, the research addresses the gap in the existing literature by considering the variation of budget constraints over timeâ€”a factor often neglected in traditional WTP estimations. By offering the Infection and Treatment Method (ITM) vaccine at a subsidized rate, the study seeks to provide insights into optimal pricing and subsidy strategies to enhance vaccine adoption. The findings will have significant implications for Kenyas agricultural and livestock development policies, particularly in controlling ECF outbreaks. The method will provide estimates, which will be important for setting prices and optimal subsidies to maximize vaccine adoption. The study will also uncover factors that hinder the adoption of vaccines, shedding light on their potential role in ECF control and the broader context of agricultural and livestock development in Kenya.  Lastly, this study&rsquo;s main contribution lies in integrating the impact of exogenous liquidity constraints on the prices eliciting the WTP. In addition to providing precise estimates of WTP, the data collection structure will enable to address a key research question: how sensitive are WTP measures to household constraints, such as seasonal income fluctuations or unexpected health expenses? Understanding whether these external factors influence household&rsquo;s stated prices will help assess the overall reliability of these measures. Practically, the findings could guide the optimal timing and marketing strategies for ECF vaccines.'
