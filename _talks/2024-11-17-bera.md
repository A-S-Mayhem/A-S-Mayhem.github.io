Presented a 12 minutes talk to complete requirement for the IDC 451 course. In the talk I gave a brief introduction to the paper [Quantum Bayes’ rule affirming consistency in measurement inferences in quantum mechanics](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.012224) in which I layed out my (hopefully correct) interpretation of the framework used. An example from the paper was explained as well. Click title to see presentation.
