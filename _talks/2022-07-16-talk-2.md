### Abstract
In a scenario of tasks and agents that could perform them at a specified cost, the Assignment Problem aims to find the best pairs that attain an optimal cost. 
Such a question is very common across industries, especially with scarcity of resources, and an efficient solution is of paramount importance. 
It is also theoretically linked with its unweighted version, commonly referred to as Bipartite Matching, thanks to which the conditions for a solution can be identified. 
<br/>
First, the problem is presented from a mathematical perspective. 
Then, properties from the graph theory and linear algebra spectrum are leveraged, highlighting a meeting point of the two subjects. 
Lastly, a solution through the Hungarian Algorithm by Kuhn is analyzed and justified using prior results. 
The whole reasoning process is backed by formal justification, with proofs and a clear set of defined objects.
