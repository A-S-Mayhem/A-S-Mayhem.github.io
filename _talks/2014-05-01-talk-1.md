This talk introduces a paper that uses the propensity score matching (PSM) method to analyze the cohabitation effect in urban China: the relationship between premarital cohabitation and marital disruption. Using data on urban individuals married during 1978-1999 and 2000-2010 from Chinese Family Panel Studies in 2010, this article matches married ones with cohabitation histories prior to first marriage—whether cohabited with the spouse or not, and applies Cox Proportional Hazards Models to explore how premarital cohabitation affects an individual’s
subsequent divorce hazards of first marriage.
