**Abstract**: Natural language processing (NLP) is becoming increasingly adapted in the real-world. To many, NLP is the new resource of growth and wealth. However, the NLP landscape is like the Wild West now: many and growing numbers of players, fast innovations, and limited oversight.  In this talk, I will discuss the major challenges in taming the Wild West of NLP.  I will present our work in recent years in in addressing these challenges. I will showcase some of the work in concrete domains (e.g. compliance). I will also share thoughts on a general approach towards adapting NLP to solve real-world problems.
