Ambient noise interferometry is a passive acoustic technique for environment characterization. The technique uses coherent ambient sound to approximate the Green&apos;s function between two sensors. It has previously been used in ocean acoustics to passively estimate water temperature, sound-speed structure, and mode shapes as well as for sensor localization. Since this technique utilizes the ambient noise field, whose characteristics are often unknown, understanding the effects of non-isotropic ambient sound is important for ambient noise interferometry. In this talk an overview of the theoretical literature for noise interferometry will be presented with a specific emphasis on the effects of non-isotropic ocean noise source distributions. Additionally, simulations that explore the emergence of the Green&apos;s function will be presented. Specifically, sound source distributions and environmental parameters such as sound speed profile will be explored. Lastly, the implications of these works on the possibilities and limitations of ambient noise interferometry will be discussed. [work supported by ONR]
