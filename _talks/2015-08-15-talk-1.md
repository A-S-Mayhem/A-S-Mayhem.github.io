In this talk, I had the opportunity to delve into the fascinating subject of the implications of climate and land-use change for hydropower operations. Specifically, I focused on the remarkable research conducted on the Tapajos River Basin, where the replacement of native vegetation with agricultural lands has prompted significant short-, medium-, and long-term changes in evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and surface runoff.
