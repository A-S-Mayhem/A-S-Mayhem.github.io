We consider a repeated persuasion setting where a sender seeks to persuade a
myopic receiver to choose the sender’s preferred actions by selectively sharing
information about payoff-relevant states drawn i.i.d. from an unknown prior
distribution. We study the sender’s problem of making persuasive
recommendations to achieve low regret against an optimal persuasion mechanism
that knows the prior. We propose an algorithm that, with high probability, is
persuasive across all rounds and achieves O(sqrt(T log T)) regret, where T is the
horizon length. Intuitively, at each time our algorithm maintains a set of
candidate priors, and chooses a persuasion scheme that is simultaneously
persuasive for all of them. Finally, we prove a matching lower-bound (up to log T
terms) on the regret of any algorithm that holds even if the persuasiveness
requirements were significantly relaxed
