Me and two other PhD candidates in our program were invited to speak about the process of planning and executing our practicum projects.
The panel was a part of the class CEP 955, which is a required class where students plan their first independent research projects.
I talked about the challenges I encountered in my practicum ([which was eventually published at SIGCSE](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3545945.3569775)),
and offered some advice to the class of mostly 2nd year PhD students.
