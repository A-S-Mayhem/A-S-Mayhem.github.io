Presented a 12 minute talk as part of the PHY 631 course. In the talk I gave a brief introduction to the paper [Quantum circuits cannot control unknown operations](https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/16/9/093026) in which I explained the contents of the paper, along with the deterministic version of the no-programming theorem.
