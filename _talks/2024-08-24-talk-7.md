This presentation at Docker DevTools Day 3.0, focuses on policy-based control for cloud-native environments using Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Gatekeeper. It introduces OPA as a general-purpose policy engine and Gatekeeper as its Kubernetes-native implementation, highlighting their role in addressing modern policy enforcement challenges. The presentation covers various usage scenarios, including resource constraints, security enforcement, and compliance, while also discussing potential challenges such as the learning curve and integration complexity. Overall, it aims to showcase how OPA and Gatekeeper can enhance policy management and governance in Kubernetes environments.
