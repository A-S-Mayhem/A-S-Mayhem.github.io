excerpt: 'Despite the growing influence of “generative AI” tools on K-12 education, there has been little scholarship on pre-service teachers. The purpose of our study is to understand the perspectives of pre-service teachers on generative AI tools and the role that they will play in education broadly, as well as their own practice. We administered pre-surveys and conducted interviews with upper level teacher education majors in a large Midwestern university. Preliminary analysis from our interviews show that pre-service teachers are eager to learn more but hold a variety of beliefs and emotions about generative AI ranging from fear and distrust to zeal and over-optimism. This is an important step to developing curricula that responds to the perspectives of new teachers.'
