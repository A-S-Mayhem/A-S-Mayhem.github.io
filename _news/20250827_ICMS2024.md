description: 'Xian had a blast at the 2024 International Conference on Molecular Simulation (ICMS 2024) in Wuhan! He presented an invited talk titled "Rational Design of Novel Electrolytes Assisted by Molecular Simulation and Machine Learning". The conference was a fantastic opportunity for Xian to rub elbows with some of the big names in the field of molecular simulation. He soaked up a ton of knowledge and even had the thrill of meeting Professor Alexei A. Kornyshev in person for the first time. Xian was over the moon about this encounter, as he has been a long-time admirer of Professor Kornyshev, having devoured many of his articles in the past. It was definitely a highlight of the conference for him!'
