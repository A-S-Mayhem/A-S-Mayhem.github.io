I am glad to annouce the publication of my first coursera project ["Finding bibliography metrics using the crossref API"](https://www.coursera.org/projects/finding-bibliography-metrics-using-crossref-api). This project makes it convenient for learners to analyze different bibliography metrics from different fields, such as impact and number of collaborators. 

I learned about this useful package from my mentor Dr. Julien Brun during my 2019 summer data intern at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). When I was asked to decide on topics for the coursera projects, this package first come to my mind. 

Please feel free to comment under this post if you have any feedback for my project or if there is any particular R packages you'd like me to teach. I am also open to teach any open softwares that could be helpful to researchers or useful to general public who are interested in science (i.e., citizen scientists). 

Hold on there. Have a nice weekend, everyone!
