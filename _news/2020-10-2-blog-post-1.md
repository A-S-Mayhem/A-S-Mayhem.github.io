Publication of my first data science project on Coursera
========================

<br>
I am glad to annouce the publication of my first coursera project ["Finding bibliography metrics using the crossref API"](https://www.coursera.org/projects/finding-bibliography-metrics-using-crossref-api). This project makes it convenient for learners to analyze different bibliography metrics from different fields, such as impact and number of collaborators. 

I have been thinking a lot about how to make use of the data I have in Mendeley other than just read each individual papers in the past few years. Can I get field development tendency out of this pile of papers? Are there any particular sub-topic is more impactful than others? If I have 99% papers in my field stored in Mendeley, can I make predictions about which sub-field is going to be impactful in the next 10 years?
I learned about this useful package ['rcrossref'](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rcrossref/rcrossref.pdf) from my mentor Dr. Julien Brun during my 2019 summer data intern at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). When I was asked to decide on topics for the coursera projects, this package first come to my mind. 

Please feel free to comment under this post if you have any feedback for my project or if there is any particular R packages you'd like me to teach. I am also open to teach any open softwares that could be helpful to researchers or useful to general public who are interested in science (i.e., citizen scientists). 

Hold on there. Have a nice weekend, everyone!
