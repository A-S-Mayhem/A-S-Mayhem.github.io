Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often require complex, multimodal intervention provided by a de facto&quot; team comprised of parents, teachers and other school, clinical and community-based service providers (Lord and Mcgee 2001 ; Singer et al, 2012). Connections among &quot;de facto&quot; providers can potentially create social capital advantages through shared goals, interventions, knowledge and resources (Bronnfenbrenner 1979) . In our study, we conducted a mixed methods investigation of schools as key contexts that shape the social capital of &quot;de facto&quot; teams of children with ASD. For low income children, with few resources for private treatments, schools serve as a primary source of intervention for autism (Odom et al., 2005). Findings suggest that the social capital of &quot;de facto&quot; treatment teams varies between schools, with greater gaps in the fall than the spring, shaped in part by the configuration of staff and the management of autism treatment in schools.&quot;
