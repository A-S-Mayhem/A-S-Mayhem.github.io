*"When the word 'Barbarian' rings a bell, we tend to think of brutal behavior and uncivilized actions. But were they truly like that, or was it simply the perspective of the societies around them?"*

## Who Were Barbarians?  

### Civilizations and Their Barbarian Penumbra  
#### *By Benjamin Swartz*  

The word **Barbarian** refers to an *uncivilized person* or *malicious people*, or in the Greek sense, **one who does not speak Greek**. The Greeks viewed all non-Greek speakers as barbarians because all they heard was *"bar, bar, bar."*

**Commonly labeled Barbarians:**  
🛡️ *Mongols*  
🛡️ *Amorites*  
🛡️ *Xiongnu*  
🛡️ *Huns*  
🛡️ *Goths*  
🛡️ *Scythians*  

Barbarian warfare was **brutal and relentless**, often destroying entire villages and civilizations. They lacked the **structured armies** of Rome and Greece but compensated with **ferocity, speed, and overwhelming attacks**.

> *"The beast-like nature of the barbarians plagued and devastated the entire world."*

- They forced **Romans to fight in dense forests**, where **Roman tactics failed**.  
- Their success came from **guerilla tactics and unpredictability**.
