### Makerhacks at Sentry: Building a Wi-Fi-Controlled Robot in 24 Hours  

I competed in **Makerhacks**, hosted at Sentry, taking on the robotics challenge. With an **ESP32**, two **TT motors**, a **motor driver**, and a custom-designed **chassis modeled in SolidWorks**, I set out to build a **Wi-Fi-controlled robot**—all in just 24 hours.  

#### The Build  

The core of my project was an **ESP32-based robot** that could be remotely controlled via a **web interface**. I wrote a server in C++ that allowed users to send movement commands using **WASD keys** in a browser. The ESP32 processed these commands and controlled the motors accordingly.  

##### Here’s a breakdown of how it worked:  

- **Hardware:** ESP32, TT motors, motor driver, and a 3D-printed chassis.  
- **Software:** A web server running on the ESP32, handling keyboard inputs for directional movement.  
- **Controls:**  
  - **"W"** to move forward  
  - **"A"** to turn left  
  - **"S"** to move backward  
  - **"D"** to turn right  
  - The robot stopped when no keys were pressed.  

I coded **all night**, debugging **Wi-Fi connectivity issues** and fine-tuning **motor response times**. Despite the lack of sleep, I successfully got the robot working just in time for the demo.  

## The Outcome  

By the end of the hackathon, my robot was **fully functional**, responding smoothly to user input. Competing in the robotics challenge pushed my limits in both **hardware and software**, and the adrenaline of the deadline made it an **unforgettable experience**.  

Would I do it again? **Absolutely.** Maybe with more sleep next time.
