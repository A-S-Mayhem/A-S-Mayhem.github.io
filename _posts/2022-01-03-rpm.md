Blog Background
======
In October 2021, I was selected by the school to participate in **the Innovation & Practice Programme for the Cultivation of High-level Internationalized Talents**. This program requires us to take two extra courses each term. For the semester of 2021 Fall, I enrolled in **Big Data and Public Health** and **Business, Entrepreneurship, and the Sustainable Development Goals**. At the end of "Big Data and Public Health", Professor Ramin Ramezani from UCLA asked us to investigate the concept of **Remote Patient Monitoring Systems**. Luckily, I received 96 out of 100 for this homework. I would love to share my findings of RPM in this blog.

What is Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) Systems?
======

RPM Systems refers to systems that utilize technologies to monitor patients’ health conditions at a distance (away from hospital). It is an application field of telemedicine and e-health that makes use of real-time patient data trackers and data analysis software. More specifically, it often uses sensors to collect patients’ health data and send the information to a platform through radio or Wi-Fi technology. Then, preliminary data analysis will be made to clean the data and organize the data. Doctors and users will review the data report or receive emergency risk signals. Based on these, doctors can take actions on patients’ later treatments.   

The Motivations of Developing RPM Systems
======
1.	The cumulative effects of the aging population.  
As the development of society, the birth rate is decreasing. Large part of population is made up of aging groups. Health problems are common among elderly people. Therefore, elderly people pay frequent visits to hospitals. However, due to limited space in hospital, elderly people with diseases cannot be all hospitalized. Instead, they are sent back home if they do not have acute illnesses. To better supervise their health conditions, remote health condition monitoring is needed.
2.	Long-term recovery of certain patients.  
Some diseases need a long time to recover, such as bone fracture. Bone fracture sometimes needs months or years to recover. During the recovery, if patients can report their condition to doctors through remote monitoring tools, doctors can understand their situations better and give better medical advice in later treatments. 
3.	Pandemics like COVID-19.  
During pandemics, people may be isolated for quarantine. To lower the risk of spreading infectious diseases, people are left alone in their own room. In this situation, doctors and nurses cannot reach people in quarantine and they need contactless tools to facilitate them. Tools that can monitor patients’ health condition like body temperature, eating conditions can help with doctors and agencies to respond better to possible situations.

The Benefits of Having RPM Systems
======
1.	Easier access to health support and monitoring.  
Without RPM system, people can only receive medical support if they go to the hospital. However, large amount of time is wasted in waiting in line during hospital visits. With RPM system, common diseases like cold can be treated better, long-term diseases can be monitored at home.
2.	Higher-quality medical care by making use of patients' personal data.  
Sometimes, patients are not aware that some tiny symptoms can be of great help for doctors to diagnose their condition. With RPM devices, patient data will be collected automatically, doctors can make better judgement and give better treatments.  
3.	Individuals have more control of their personal health.  
Imagine one can know their heart rate, respiration rate and other important health factors every day. If there is some abnormality happens someday, they can make immediate changes to their life and make a doctor appointment instead of doing nothing until emergency event happens. This will tremendously improve individuals’ life and better ensure people’s safety.

How Can We Improve Current RPM Systems?
======
1.	Better Signal Processing Technology.  
Most of RPM systems are in the form of wearable devices. However, some people are skeptical of their reliability. For example, these devices are based on sensors, what if these sensors went wrong, or will errors occur during data transmission?
2.	Solutions to Privacy Issue.  
Users are concerned about the security of current RPM system. Will they collect personal data secretly, what will they use these data and so on. To tackle this problem, we need to set certain regulations and ensure data misuse won’t happen.
3.	Better Networking Technology
RPM systems are only accessible in location with Wifi, Bluetooth or other networking technology. Remote areas that lack network facilities still do not have access to RPM systems. 

In Closing
======
The RPM Systems is a hot topic both for research and engineering. This area craves technology breakthroughs in Big Data Analytics, Signal Processing, Mobile Networking and User Interface Design. I would love to learn more about related technology and participate in RPM projects that help to create better healthcare services for people in need.
