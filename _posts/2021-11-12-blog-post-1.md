Today, I gave a poster presentation about my research "travel direction as a fundamental component of human navigation" at this year's [Harvard Women in Psychology's Annual Trends in Psychology Summit](https://women.psychology.harvard.edu/) (TiPS). I  really enjoyed learning about research conducted by female scientists from different subfields of psychology. In the mentoring session, learning the career path of a computational cognitive neuroscientist is also deeply inspiring.
