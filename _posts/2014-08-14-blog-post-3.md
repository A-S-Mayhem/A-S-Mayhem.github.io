I recently completed the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) program. This program introduced me to the intricacies of marine biology and microbiology through hands-on research and rigorous coursework. Over four intense weeks, I conducted field research that included porpoise necropsies, dolphin size measurements, and ocean surveys, gaining insights into marine ecosystems and their delicate balance. The program offered college-level courses in Marine Mammal Physiology and Microbiology, where I deepened my understanding of how marine animals adapt to their environments and how microorganisms play critical roles in maintaining ecological health.

The highlight of my experience was designing a research project on plastic-eating bacteria and their potential to degrade ocean microplastics. This project merged my passion for sustainability with my growing interest in microbiology, as I investigated how specific bacterial strains might mitigate the environmental crisis posed by plastic pollution. The experience expanded my scientific knowledge and sharpened my problem-solving and analytical skills. COSMOS was more than an educational programâ€”it was a transformative experience that solidified my passion for exploring the mysteries of the ocean and finding innovative solutions to protect it.
