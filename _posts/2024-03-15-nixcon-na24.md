I [spoke](https://2024-na.nixcon.org/talks/#the-case-for-nix-on-the-home-server) at [NixCon North America](https://2024-na.nixcon.org/) this year. The event was co-located with [SCaLE 21x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x) (March 14-17, 2024 in Pasadena, California). This is a talk for **beginners** to Nix. You will learn the highlights of what Nix offers and see how Nix helps to set up a home server.
