I always proclaim myself as a brave person. Nevertheless, a competition held in February weakened my faith. It was held in an effort to promote the development of open-source softwares. The competition itself was nothing, and all we participants need to do is just presenting our PowerPoints online (even don't have to communicate face to face).

The content of my presentation has actually been introduced to audiences on other occasions. So, there's nothing to worry about for me. When it comes to my turn, I was so exicited and confident, and I can hardly wait to prove the software products we developed are truly feasible, efficient and practical.
