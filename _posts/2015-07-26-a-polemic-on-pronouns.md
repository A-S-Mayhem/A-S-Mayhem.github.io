English speakers used to distinguish between *thou*, a word used to address a single person, and *you*, a word used to address more than one person. Just as kings used a royal, plural *we* when referring to one person, English speakers came to use a flattering *you* when addressing a single person. The Quakers retained *thou* to avoid elevating anyone with *you*. To non-Quakers, this standing on principle sounded antiquated and pedantic.

Today we face a similar problem that mixes plurality and sociology: we are told that the singular, third person pronoun is *he*. We are told that *she* implies a gender; while to say *he* could mean either male or genderless. This is confusing, so in speech we use a singular *they*. ("Some*one* came up to me and *they* said...") We are told that, in writing, it is incorrect to use the singular *they* because they "should be" plural. Instead we are told to use *he*, which "should be" (or, preposterously, "is") genderless.

*He* and *she* are gendered now and have always been gendered. Maybe it's possible to hear *he* and think "any old human, male or female", but I'm afriad that it's easier to hear "any old human", in the sense that men are genderless humans and women --the *she*-- are something different. To say that *they* is grammatically incorrect, or that *they* is unpoetical, ignores that the [use of *they* as singular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they) has a [long history](https://web.archive.org/web/20090430053036/http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html). Even Shakespeare wrote: "There's not a man I meet but doth salute me / As if I were *their* well-acquainted friend" (*Comedy of Errors*).

I say, let us call a single person *they*, keeping *he* for men and *she* for women. Let us do in our writing as we do in our speech. Even if this were bad for grammar --which I think is just made-up pedantry-- it is good for women, and I would rather grammar suffer, than women.
