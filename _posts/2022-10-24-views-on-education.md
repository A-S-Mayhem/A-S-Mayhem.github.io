# Background
I obtaied poor education when I was yong, most of them sounds rediculous these days. 

# education on congitive for children
I listened a conversasion when I do my prepration for my TOEFL test, on students said his six-month-old niece and he  were kocking a little ball around and it rolled under the couch, she immediately lost interest and reached for somethink else. why? Because to her, the call ceased to exit and she thinks thing disappear  when thay're out of sight. 

THis story really interested me and reminds me another things. There was time on the summer in 2009, my two-yeads-old brother, was chasing me(I don't the concrete reason), we just running around a table, I was yongger and stronger that him since I was ten years older than him. Therefore, I ahead of him for a circle, I just followed behind him closely. He realized that I was closely behind him after he looked back when I was disappear and out of his sight. He bursted out tears and kept running, because to him, it's too long for a whole circle to catch up me. It's so interesting that he don't know he was able to catch up me if he turned back. 

we needto be trained to gian cognition.
