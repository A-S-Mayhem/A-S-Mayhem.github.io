# Background
I obtained poor education when I was young, and most of them sound ridiculous these days. 

# education on cognitive for children
I listened to a conversation when I do my preparation for my TOEFL test, one student said his six-month-old niece he was knocking a little ball around and it rolled under the couch, she immediately lost interest and reached for something else. why? Because to her, the call ceased to exit and she thinks things disappear when they're out of sight. 

This story really interested me and reminds me of another thing. There was a time in the summer of 2009, my two-yeads-old brother, was chasing me(I don't the concrete reason), we just ran around a table, I was younger and stronger than him since I was ten years older than him. Therefore, I was ahead of him for a circle, and I just followed behind him closely. He realized that I was close behind him after he looked back when I was disappear and out of his sight. He burst into tears and kept running, because to him, it was too long for a whole circle to catch up with me. It's so interesting that he doesn't know he was able to catch up with me if he turned back. 

we need to be trained to gain cognition.
