One of the most underrated card tricks of all time. (Clever mathematics included.)

_I have used [this website](https://deck.of.cards/old/) to create the pictures below._

This trick was devised by Dr. William Fitch Cheney Jr. in the late 1950’s and was printed in Wallace Lee’s _Math Miracles_, 1960. The original trick is as follows:

A participant picks up a deck of cards (no Jokers), shuffles it and then pulls out five cards at random. Alice (Magician A) picks up the cards, picks out one of them and places it face down onto the table, then arranges the remaining four cards face up on the table. The volunteer then calls Bob (Magician B) into the room, who looks at the face up cards and states the identity of the face down card!

Mind blowing isn’t it! The best part of this trick is that it doesn’t involve any sneaky tricks or sleight of card. Alice could even be replaced by a computer program and the trick would work out just fine.
So you’d might want to spend some time on finding out how this trick works before looking at the solution.

## Ready?

Now, it’s necessary for some information to be exchanged between Alice and Bob, even if not directly. Stating them in the description of the trick would give it away however, and it wouldn’t be obvious to the audience at first glance. Firstly, Alice only hides the card which shares its suit with another card out of the four.[^1]
[Pigeonhole Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle) applies; 5 cards and 4 suits, so two cards must share the same suit.

If you look closely, the card placed right next to the hidden card share their suit; a marker to convey information about the hidden card’s suit to Bob.[^2]
Once the suit of the hidden card has been determined, the rank of the card still needs to be conveyed to Bob.
