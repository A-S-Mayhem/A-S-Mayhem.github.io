One of the most underrated card tricks of all time. (Clever mathematics included.)

_I have used [this website](https://deck.of.cards/old/) to create the pictures below._

This trick was devised by Dr. William Fitch Cheney Jr. in the late 1950’s and was printed in Wallace Lee’s _Math Miracles_, 1960. The original trick is as follows:

A participant picks up a deck of cards (no Jokers), shuffles it and then pulls out five cards at random. Alice (Magician A) picks up the cards, picks out one of them and places it face down onto the table, then arranges the remaining four cards face up on the table. The volunteer then calls Bob (Magician B) into the room, who looks at the face up cards and states the identity of the face down card!
