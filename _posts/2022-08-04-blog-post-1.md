In the past week, I attended the annual [Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC)](https://aaic.alz.org/overview.asp) in San Diego. It's my first time attending an in-person conference since pandemic, first time attending a alzheimer-focused conference, and first time meeting the [MIND Data Science Lab](https://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/research/mind-data-science-lab) members in person, in the beautiful city of San Diego!
