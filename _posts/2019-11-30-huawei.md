We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these, are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. ——_Jefferson, T. The Declaration of Independence, 1776. _

There is something that I hold constantly, that we are, above all, human beings, possessing human nature, which is then followed by, say, Chinese, Japanese, Americans, that our patriotism lies in loving our fellow citizens, our culture, our landscapes, but nothing to do with corporations, governments. 

Consequently, although I am Chinese, I stand firmly with the engineer who was sent to prison 251 days by Huawei. I do so out of my human nature, my independent thoughts, and my patriotism.

# I pledge here that I will do my best not to give any profits to Huawei.
