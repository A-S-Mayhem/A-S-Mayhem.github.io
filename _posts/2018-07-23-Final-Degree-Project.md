excerpt: The graphical representation of programs and algorithms is a field of research with relevant publications of more than 25 years. Since its inception, its use has been shown to improve significantly the learning process for students of different academic levels. However, this type of approaches requires a major effort on the part of professors to be them correctly integrated.

AsgAR is a system developed as a Final Degree Project at University of Castilla~La Mancha (UCLM), which as a part of the [IAPRO](http://blog.uclm.es/grupochico/proyecto-iapro/) research project to improve the programming learning for university level students, as well as allowing professors to explain programming concepts in an easy way.

This project has been developed using the Eclipse platform and the Augmented Reality device, Microsoft HoloLens, to generate graphical representations based on a metaphor or roads and traffic signs for visualizing programs and algorithms. For doing so, it has been proposed a system based on advanced interaction and visualization techniques such as Augmented Reality and multimodal interaction for providing a natural communication and visualization experience.

This system uses the physical space to locate and align the graphical representations in real time in order to show the static structure of programs (e.g. loops, conditional and return statemtens, definition of functions and expressions). These representations are automatically generated by the system, facilitating to professors represent a program or algorithm without the need of investing time and effort. In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BwC-D9zTaU), the functioning of the system and the architecture proposed for its development can be seen.
