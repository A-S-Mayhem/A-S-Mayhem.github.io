let me just put some quick notes on markdown syntax for reference. These ones are fairly cmmonly used. 

1.  Headings `#(1-6)` <br/> 

2. Italics `*italics*`<br/> 

   *italics*

3. Bold font `**italics**` <br/> 
    **bold font**
 
4. Unordered list with `-` <br/> 
- unordered list 1
- unordered list 2

5. Ordered list `1. 2. 3. ...` <br/> 

6. Quote  `>` <br/> 

> This must be a qute from a grat scientist Alcide Zhao

7. horizontal line "---" <br/> 
---

8. inline code ``inline code`` <br/> 
I just want to have some `inline code ` here, which should looks `fancy`

9. Block code "``` A block of code```" <br/> 
```
Aha, well, maybe a block of code is better
```
10. Math `$x^2$` <br/> 
how about some mathematical equations $x=y^2$
