In the past two weeks, I attended [Neurohackademy 2021](https://neurohackademy.org/neurohack_year/2021/) - a summer school for neuroscience and data science. The first week was a series of well-designed lectures and workshops on cloud computing, statistics, big data methods, open science, etc. In the second week (neurohack week), I worked as a member of the dicom-parser team  (with team leader Zvi Baratz from Tel Aviv University and Michał Szczepanik from Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of the Polish Academy of Sciences) to help with documentation and data testing of the open source Python package - [dicom_parser](https://github.com/open-dicom/dicom_parser). This is the first time I contribute to an open source package, and I'm sure that it will just be the start of the journey.
