I'm glad that my project on big data analyses of self-reported navigation ability using the [Sea Hero Quest dataset](https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/research/for-researchers/resources-and-information/sea-hero-quest/) was accepted by the journal [Machine Learning with Applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/machine-learning-with-applications) today. In the paper, Carol (my co-first author) and I proposed a machine learning pipeline to analyze patterns in cognitive ability from big data.
