> This blog collects the major contribution of researches on traffic control with reinforcement learning .

1.  [_Traffic Signal Control using Reinforcement Learning and the Max-Plus Algorithm as a Coordinating Strategy_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338911)

    * Promote **coordination** among agents by **designing reward structure** based on Max-Plus Algorithm
        * Require pre-defined coordination structure
        * Only suited to discrete action space
        * Some pre-defined conditions need to be assumed which is related to convergence.

2.  [_Using a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Traffic Signal Control_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01142.pdf) 

    * Define state space to encode vehicle information, which allows application of CNN

3.  [_CoLight: Learning Network-level Cooperation for Traffic Signal Control_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3357384.3357902)    
    
    * Achieve **cooperation** through **graph attention network**
   
4.  [_Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8667868)

    * Solve **decentralized** adaptive traffic control problem using independent actor-critic framework 
    * Propose to incorporate neighbor and historical information of each agent to stablize learning process

5.  [_Toward A Thousand Lights: Decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control_](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5744)

    * Achieve scalability in large-Scale problem
    * Design individual reward function with transportation domain knowledge (max pressure control) that can achieve coordnations
