> This blog collects the major contribution of researches on traffic control with reinforcement learning .

1.  [_Traffic Signal Control using Reinforcement Learning and the Max-Plus Algorithm as a Coordinating Strategy_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338911)
    * Promote **coordination** among agents by **designing reward structure** based on Max-Plus Algorithm
        * Require pre-defined coordination structure
        * Only suited to discrete action space
        * Some pre-defined conditions need to be assumed which is related to convergence.

2.  [_Using a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Traffic Signal Control_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01142.pdf) 
    * Define state space to encode vehicle information, which allows application of CNN

3.  [_CoLight: Learning Network-level Cooperation for Traffic Signal Control_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3357384.3357902)    
    * Achieve **cooperation** through **graph attention network**
   
4.  [_Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8667868)
    * Solve **decentralized** adaptive traffic control problem using independent actor-critic framework 
    * Propose to incorporate neighbor and historical information of each agent to stablize learning process

5.  [_Toward A Thousand Lights: Decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control_](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5744)
    * Achieve scalability in large-Scale problem
    * Design individual reward function with transportation domain knowledge (max pressure control) that can achieve coordnations
    
6. [Assessment of Reward Functions in Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Modal Urban Traffic Control under Real-World limitations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08819.pdf)
    * Evaluate 30 different reward function for traffic signal control

7. [AttendLight: Universal Attention-Based Reinforcement Learning Model for Traffic Signal Control](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/29e48b79ae6fc68e9b6480b677453586-Paper.pdf)
    * Introduce attention module to train universal models for traffic signal control. 
        * One attention module to encode state information, therefore achieve generalizability on different numbers of roads-lanes
        * On atterntion module to encode action information, therefore achieve generalizability on different numbers of phases
        
8. [MetaLight: Value-Based Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/AAAI/article/view/5467)
    * Adpot meta-reinforcement learning paradigm that can reuse previous learned knowledge to facilitate the learning process in new target intersection
