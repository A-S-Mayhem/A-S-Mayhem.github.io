> This blog collects the major contribution of researches on traffic control with reinforcement learning .

1.  [_Traffic Signal Control using Reinforcement Learning and the Max-Plus Algorithm as a Coordinating Strategy_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338911)

    * Promote coordination among agents by **designing reward structure** based on Max-Plus Algorithm
        * Require pre-defined coordination structure
        * Only suited to discrete action space
        * Some pre-defined conditions need to be assumed which is related to convergence.
