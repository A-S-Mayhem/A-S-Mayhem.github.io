I'm very happy to present my work of simulating the travel direction system in humans using a recurrent neural network as a poster presentation at the [Women in Machine Learning (WiML) Un-Workshop](https://sites.google.com/wimlworkshop.org/wiml-unworkshop2022/home?authuser=0) at [International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)](https://icml.cc/) (see [here](https://slideslive.com/38987407/a-recurrent-neural-network-model-of-travel-direction-in-humans) for a video recording). Although the virtual format has restricted my ways of receiving audience feedback, I still quite enjoyed sharing my research with the women in machine learning community. Additionally, I volunteered to assist with moderating at the virtual mentoring session. Happy that I've participated in the workshop in various ways.

It's interesting that every time I attended a mentorship panel I always get some inspiring tips - no end of learning new things! One of the impressive suggestion I received this time is from [Dr. Po-Ling Loh](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpmms.cam.ac.uk%2F~pll28%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2iGDejshvlMEb9BrNcgVgQ) about treating your doctoral degree as a driver's license. And yup, that's just the beginning of my journey :)
