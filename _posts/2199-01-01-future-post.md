I have now completed my studies at UC Berkeley.

# My Final Semester
------
  It is surreal finishing my last semester at UC Berkeley. I graduated with a double major in Statistics and Computer Science and was able to learn so much in the classroom, but more important than that in college is what you learn outside of the classroom. On the surface level, this might seem like research and teaching, which though taught me so much, still pale in comparison to the incredible people you meet and conversations you have. I gained so many insightful perspectives on everything ranging from politics, philosophy, technology, and so much more that have made me much more informed and able to see the world in a different light. The culmination of my undergraduate has come with many difficult decisions, like whether or not to pursue a PhD. It always seemed like a natural path to me, but too large a piece of me felt like the quicker way for me to make real change in the world was to go straight out into the world (not to mention the massive opportunity cost I think 5 years of a PhD could have both financially and more importantly to me in the enjoyment venue). 
  I also grew my love for Forecasting with the greatest class ever taught [Stat 165](https://stat165.berkeley.edu/) where my favorite component was a forecasting competition throughout the whole semester (where our score forecasting in the format of 1 binary question and 2/3 80% confidence intervals a week was worth 20% of our grade). Sadly, I came up short of the victory, making some aggressive forecasts (that in hindsight was not a good strategy) that didn't pay off. However, I learned so much and helped expand my skills in a field I already have such a deep passion for. 
  I wrote a couple of papers that I'm relatively proud of within my coursework, first in my Information Theory class I wrote a [paper](STAT_157_Final_Project (1).pdf) on the utilization of Information Theory in things like dimensionality reduction. I additionally wrote a [paper]() on forecasting existential risk to humanity, in a paper I wish I had another year to work on, given the endless things I would want to learn and people I would want to talk to in that field.
  Overall, I have very limited regrets about my undergraduate years, and feel that the best decision in my life so far was going to UC Berkeley. Go Bears!
