I always proclaim myself as a brave person, and I am really proud of my courage. 

When my undergraduate, I succeeded in many public speeches in the classroom, competitions and class activities, though I hold a personality of low profile and silence, and never trained as a public spokenman. It was my courage that support me to fulfill these heroic undertaking. Additionally, courage also helped me in some important moment of taking desicions. 

When a man is trapped in a dilemma, the courage will be the engine that drives him away from the mire. 

I think my courage is deeply rooted in the reading experience when childhood. At grade 5, I received a gift from my cousin. It was a book named legends and myths of ancient Greek, written by H. A. Kuhn. Different from common fairy tale books with the same theme, this book from my cousin is entirely an academic translation. Despite the obscure languages, I was completely fascinated in the legent characters and stories in that world. My favorite god is Hermes, the god of commerce, traveller, thief, and husbandary. I was always wondering how great it would be if I could have the same flying shoes! On the other hand, my favorite hero (i.e., half-god) is Heracles, who was raised to the god of Olympus after he finished his twelve great achievements.
