## A bit of context 

It was nearly a year ago when I decided to learn Dutch or Nederlands<sup>1</sup>, a term Dutch use to refer to their own language. My efforts to learn Dutch was not concerted at all and I only did it in my spare time and most often whenever I travel to Holland. At the moment I would describe my Dutch efficiency as modest. I can read easier parts of newspaper articles columns, speak at the basic level and write some of weird Dutch words without mistakes. In my opinion, one of the difficulties to learn the language by yourself is to find approporiate learning resources, and in this post I am going to introduce some of resources I have found useful. Hopefully, there will be some Dutch learners and others who find this article interesting and helpful. I divide the list of resources into three categories: beginner, intermediate, and more challenging. 

I should also mention few good online dictionaries you may like to consistently use. Google Translate is an application that I frequently use. It has many downsides particularly when it comes to Dutch expresssions and proverbs and does not offer examples. It can best be used in tandem with either of following freely accessible online dictionaries: 

* [en.bab.la](https://en.bab.la/dictionary/dutch-english/)
* [nl.glosbe](https://nl.glosbe.com/nl/en/)

I also recommend to have [Wolters Woordenboek](https://www.boekwinkeltjes.nl/s/?q=Wolters+Woordenboek+Nederlands-Engels) hard-copy at hand. I like its completeness of entries and relevant examples.  


## For beginners

* **[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/):** Well, you've probably heard of it already. Duo's Dutch lessons are well-prepared and they are great for absolute beginners. Remember that in addition to exercise lessons on your phone app, there are concise grammar tips for every lesson which are accessible via Duolingo website. Here is an exmaple from the first lesson:

* **Donald Duck Junior** is arguably one of the most popular comic strip magazines (stripverhal) in Holland and beyond, with comics from Walt Disney characters . Check out [Donald Duck Junior website](https://www.donaldduck.nl/donald-duck-junior).  

* **Stuff Dutch people like**: Learning a language is not just about words and grammar. Here is a somewhat accurate [list](https://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/complete-list/) of things Dutch people in general like. "Hagelslag", "Scheduling agenda appointments", "Zwarte Piet", "Swearing with diseases", etc are noticeable. Treat it as an index of Dutch*ness*.   

* **Some Dutch expressions and idioms**: [Here](https://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/2016/03/08/funny-dutch-expressions/) is a list of few easy-to-remember and funny Dutch expressions you might like to learn. 




## Intermediate Stuff

* **De Canon van Nederland**
is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. It was designed to provide an overview of "what everyone ought to know, at the very least, about the history and culture of the Netherlands", as well as providing a framework for the teaching of History in Dutch schools.
Check out the very cool website [entoen.nu](https://www.entoen.nu/) which hosts the canon material for use in schools and in society in general. You can create your own account and customize your learning chronological map according to your taste. 

* **Donald Duck** is a more serious version of Donald Duck Junior and yes it is read avidly by adults as well as young childrend and teenagers. Compared to Donald Duck Junior the stories are way longer and more interesting and range of vocubalaries vastly greater. I like them a lot and I have a stack of them at home. Here is the website: [donaldduck.nl/](https://www.donaldduck.nl/) 

* **Children's books** 
Some children books have helped me my learning process to be faster and more interesting. Here are few of them
 * [Meneer Blijleven](https://www.givnbooks.nl/product/tolkien-j-r-r-meneer-blijleven/) which is a Dutch translation of J.R.R.Tolkien's picture book [Mr.Bliss](https://wiki2.org/en/Mr._Bliss). The cool part is that the book includes Tolkien's story with his own handwriting and illustrations on even pages and nice Dutch translation on odd pages which makes reading the book in Dutch much easier for learners of the language. Another edition of the book with a Dutch review is available at [boekreviews.nl](http://www.boekreviews.nl/recensies/meneer-blijleven). 
 Here is my plea to you: please share with me if you know any books of this style.

 * **[Toon Tellegen](https://wiki2.org/en/Toon_Tellegen)'s children books**: So far I only looked at <q>Maar niet uit het hart. Dierenverhalen over afscheid</q>. You can find list of all his children books here: [Toon_Tellegen#Bibliografie](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toon_Tellegen#Bibliografie).  

## More Challenging

* **Geschiedenis.nl** is website with historical and cultural articles for the interest of broad public. Moreover, Geschiedenis.nl advise, leads, and holds lectures on projects in the fields of history and culture. 

* **Encyclopedia of Dutch expressions, idioms, and proverbs**: Find them at [spreekwoorden.nl](https://spreekwoorden.nl/).
If that is too much for you, just buy a pack of [Het Spreekwoorden spel](https://www.trendyspeelgoed.nl/Het-Spreekwoorden-spel.html) to play!

1. Nether means _situated down or below_ and _lower_, and the word Nederland literally refers to [the Low Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries). For instance, kan je nederlands spreken?.  <q>Koninkrijk der Nederlanden</q> (Kingdom of the Netherlands) is used officially to refer to Dutch Kingdom, and Nederland (singular) is used for the modern nation.
