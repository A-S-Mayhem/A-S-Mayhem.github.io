AI is becoming an important tool for research. I also integrate AI in my everyday research for better writing, literature review, and thougth processing. 

I have gathered a very incomprehensive list of AI tools one can integrate into their research. 

⚠️ **Warning I** Most of these tools require a subscription or premium membership to access to full features.
⚠️ **Warning II** These are useful tools, but at the same time they can produce poor results. So, be aware of the limitations of AI.
