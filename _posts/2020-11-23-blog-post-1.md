> This blog will have a comprehensive understanding multiagent system (MAS) vs transit system (TS).

 Based on [Multi-agent systems for power engineering applications - Part I: Concepts, approaches, and technical challenges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4349106), we can begin to dive in MAS with following questions:

### What is MAS?

Agent is a software (or hardware) entity that is situated in some environment and is able to autonomously react to changes in that environment, where the _Autonomy_ is the ability to schedule action based on environmental observations.
Notably, the notion of an agent is meant to be a tool for analyzing systems, not an absolute characterization that divides the world into agents and non-agents,_
A multi-agent system is simply a system comprising two or more agents.

### What benefits are offered by MAS?
 
### What differentiates MAS from existing systems and approaches?

### To what sort of problem can MAS be applied?

### How should MAS be implemented?


Based on the above understanding, we can start to think about how to manage TS with the idea of MAS.
