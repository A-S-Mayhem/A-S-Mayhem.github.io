> This blog will have a comprehensive understanding multiagent system (MAS) vs transit system (TS).

 Based on [Multi-agent systems for power engineering applications - Part I: Concepts, approaches, and technical challenges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4349106), we can begin to dive in MAS with following questions:
 
#### What benefits are offered by MAS?
 
#### What differentiates MAS from existing systems and approaches?

#### To what sort of problem can MAS be applied?

#### How should MAS be implemented?


Based on the above understanding, we can start to think about how to manage TS with the idea of MAS.
