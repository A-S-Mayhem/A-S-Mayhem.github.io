    * A **speedup** of MARL can be realized thanks to parallel computation when the agents exploit the decentralized structure of the task.
    * **Experience sharing** can help agents with similar tasks to learn faster and better.  
    * MARL is inherently robust. (i.e., When one or more agents fail in a multiagent system, the remaining agents can take over some of their tasks.)
    * MARL can lead to high degree of **scalability**. (i.e., multiagent systems can allow the easy insertion of new agents into the system.)
