New paper out in G3!
Happy to announce that "A homing suppression gene drive with multiplexed gRNAs maintains high drive conversion efficiency and avoids functional resistance alleles" is out now in G3.
Spearheaded by talented student Emily Yang, we introduce a suppression drive that avoids the formation of functional resistance alleles in experimental <i>Drosophila</i> populations. 
Check out the "Publications" section for more details.
