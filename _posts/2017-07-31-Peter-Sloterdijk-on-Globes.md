I still have not found an opportunity to start indulging myself in wrestling with the thoughts in Peter Sloterdijk's celebrated magnum opus Sphären trilogy. However, I recently watched his lecture in Tate Britain on ideas of his book _Globen and relationship of thoses ideas to art_: for instance art of living in apartments as spaces of immunity.

Here is the `abstract` of his talk: 
> Peter Sloterdijk’s philosophico-morphological theory is based on an understanding of the history of culture as spatialisations of forms. The world in which we live now requires us to design new types of ‘spatialised immunity’. More broadly, the concept of a spherical logic of space – a polymorphologic of form, order and thinking – is explicated in Spheres, his three-volume archaeology of the human attempt to dwell within spaces, from womb to globe. The Spheres project (Bubbles, Globe, Foam) is a significant topological turn in the field of contemporary philosophy, ‘a super-workout for communicative energies capable of finding contact throughout the entire world.’


Here is a link to that lecture:
