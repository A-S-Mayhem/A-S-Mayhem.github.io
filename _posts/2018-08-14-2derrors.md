I wrote this post as a reference for myself and anyone else looking to determine how to fit a model to data with both x and y uncertainties.
Commonly, in Astrophysics even when fitting data with Bayesian inference, X errors are commonly ignored and only y errors are included. This can lead to a significant underestimation of model uncertainty.

Jupyter notebook to run through the problem [here](https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/2Derrors/blob/master/fitting_with_x_and_y_errors.ipynb)
