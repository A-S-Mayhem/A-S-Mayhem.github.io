> In this blog I want to record some notes in transit control, which are basically grasped from published paper.

## Some common sense

1. Generally, bus lines with **more than 5 buses per hour** are regarded as high-frequency bus services.
2. Transit riders typically **ignore schedules** with headways less than **10â€“12 min** [R](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261511001676).

## Evaluation criteria

1. Transport authorities use **punctuality-based key performance indicators (KPIs)** to evaluate the performance of low-frequency bus services and **regularity-based KPIs** to evaluate the performance of high-frequency services [R](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21680566.2019.1606743). For high-frequency lines, the objective of control is to maintain **low headway variability** and **alleviate bus bunching** [R](https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/37878).
2. When bus service circulate on a route, service is best when times between successive bus arrivals (headway) are equal [R](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261511001676).
