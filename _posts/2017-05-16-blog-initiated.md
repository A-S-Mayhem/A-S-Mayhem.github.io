I am -finally!- launching a blog to share personal ideas and thoughts on research problems, reviews on interesting papers and worth sharing lessons that I am learning as a computer science PhD student, focusing on programming languages.

Someday -when this blog becomes super popular with hundreds of passionate readers- I will extend the topics and start writing posts on music too.
