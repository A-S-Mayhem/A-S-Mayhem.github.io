This morning, I successfully defended my Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences with a Concentration in Cognitive Neuroscience! My dissertation is titled "Travel Direction as a Fundamental Component of Human Navigation: Integrating Psychophysics, Neuroimaging, and Computational Modeling Approaches". The Spatial Neuroscience Lab had a celebration in the CNLM courtyard after my defense. 

I'm so excited to eventually receive my doctoral degree after such a long and unique journey as a graduate student. Let me end the post with a proverb "If there is a will, there is a way."
