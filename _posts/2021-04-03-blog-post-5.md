I have curated and am beginning to read AISTATS '21 [papers](http://aistats.org/aistats2021/accepted.html) related to privacy.  The list will be constantly updated with the paper summaries. Stay tuned!  
*Note that I wrote a simple script to scrape the ArXiv links to the paper and the links may not be accurate.*
