In this post I explain how I generated my Google Scholar citations automatic plot generator. After following these steps, you are going to be able to generate automatically your own Google Scholar citations plot in a daily basis, which your personal website will load (automatically too) every time someone visits it.

## What you need: OSX, crontab, R, DropBox

- You should use a Mac.
- **crontab** should already be installed by default in your machine. So, there is no need to install that.
- You should have both a DropBox and a Google Scholar account.
- **R** should be updated.

# Steps

1. Copy the script below into **R** to extract data from your Google Scholar profile. Save the script as ```gscholar.R```.

```r
# load packages
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman"); library(pacman) # conditional installation of the packages below
p_load(scholar,ggplot2,scales)

# 
cit <- get_citation_history('3FHDoL0AAAAJ&hl')

p = ggplot(cit,aes(x=year,y=cites))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab('Year')+
  ylab('Citations') +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = number_format(accuracy = 1), breaks = round(seq(min(cit$cites), max(cit$cites), by = 1),1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(cit$year), max(cit$year), by = 1),1)) +
  annotate('text',label=format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d"),x=-Inf,y=Inf,vjust=1.5,hjust=-0.05,size=3,colour='gray')  + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(#axis.text.y   = element_text(size=14),
        #axis.text.x   = element_text(size=14),
        #axis.title.y  = element_text(size=14),
        #axis.title.x  = element_text(size=14),
        #panel.background = element_blank(),
        #panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        #panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        #axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
        panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=1)) +
  ggtitle("Google Scholar Citations (updated daily)")
  
png("/Users/hectorbahamonde/Dropbox/scholar_citations.png",width=2200,height=1000,res=250)

print(p)

dev.off()
```

* Make sure you replace ```3FHDoL0AAAAJ&hl``` with *your* Google Scholar user number. You can find yours in your Google Scholar profile URL. In my case that is,

```html
https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3FHDoL0AAAAJ&hl=en
```

...that is, your user name is whatever is right after ```"user="```.

* This script is going to send the plot ```scholar_citations.png``` to your **DropBox** folder (make sure your **DropBox** folder is "/Users/HERE/...").

2. Go to **DropBox**, and get a shareable link of the plot ```scholar_citations.png``` (like [this](https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Create-upload-and-share/How-do-I-embed-images-with-a-direct-link-from-Dropbox/td-p/245432)).

3. Now the **crontab** part. Open **terminal** and type the following in this exact same order:

- ```env EDITOR=nano crontab -e```.

- 
``` r
0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/Rscript -e 'source("/Users/hectorbahamonde/hbahamonde.github.io/gscholar.R")'
```

This will execute the **R** script ```gscholar.R``` once a day. If you need more specific times, see this [link](https://crontab.guru). Make sure the path of the script ```gscholar.R``` is correct in your case. That is, in your case it should be something like this: ```'source("/Users/YOUR_USER/YOUR_FOLDER_WHERE_YOU_KEEP_THE_SCRIPT_DESCRIBED_IN_STEP_1/gscholar.R")'```. Do *not* hit ```enter``` at this point. And make sure you copy and paste this as **one** line code.
- ```CTRL```+```O```. This saves the **crontab** task.
- Hit ```enter```. This one just accept the task name.
- ```CTRL```+```X```. And this one closes down **crontab**. Mac might ask you if you want to let **Terminal** to modify your files. Accept that.

4. In your website, and using the shareable link of your ```scholar_citations.png``` plot (as described in step 2), insert the following HTML code to embed your daily-generated Google Scholar citations plot into your website. The **DropBox** link should go after ```src=```. **Notice that you have to replace whatever is after the** ```?``` **symbol to** ```raw=1```.

```html
<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hlroz3qjeyrwmta/scholar_citations.png?raw=1" alt="gscholar"  style="width:800px;height:600;;border:0;">
```


I borrowed this from [Ole Michelsen](https://ole.michelsen.dk/blog/schedule-jobs-with-crontab-on-mac-osx/). I also got help from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38778732/schedule-a-rscript-crontab-everyminute). And from [here](https://cronitor.io/cron-reference/bad-minute-crontab-error). This one was important because my **terminal** window was very narrow, and I think it was indenting the **crontab** task described in 3.b in two lines, causing the task not to save. Thanks guys!
