Welcome to my new website! I finally have a website that is not some monolith of unmaintainable code. Look forward to infrequent posts by me :). I don't usually make my musings public online.

It's now just `Jekyll build`
------
(or really `bundle exec jekyll liveserve`)

Thanks to [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) of UCSD for his beautiful Jekyll website template.
