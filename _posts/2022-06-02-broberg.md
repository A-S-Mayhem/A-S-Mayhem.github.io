Knut Betram Broberg Memorial Medal
======

I was delighted and honoured to be selected as the 2021 Bertram Broberg Medal recipient. The Broberg medal is awarded to the best Mechanics PhD thesis across the Schools of Engineering, Mathematics & Statistics and Physics at University College Dublin. The medal is supported by the UCD Bertram Broberg Memorial Fund which aims to celebrate and honour the life and work of a much-respected academic, Prof. Knut Bertram Broberg (1925-2005). 

The award ceremony took place after the Broberg lecture, which this year was given by Prof. Manish K. Tiwari (UCL). Prof. Tiwari gave a fascinating overview talk titled: "Nanoengineering interfaces for energy and healthcare". He showcased a wide breath of work that he and his group are carrying out.
