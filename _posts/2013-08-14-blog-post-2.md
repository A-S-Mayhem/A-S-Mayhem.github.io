The Brain Food Society is creating a series of displays in our school! We use TVs, Raspberry Pi's, and 3d printing to create these displays. Our goal is to fill in the lack of displays in our school. 

We also hope to solve an issue within our school: a lack of school culture. The displays will be used to showcase relevant achievements and events, to increase a sense of school culture

**These include:**
* Highlighting outstanding students
* Highlighting outstanding athletes
* School sports events
* clubs



We have also partnered with the SF ED fund who has been helping us with our funding thus far.

The Bal's slice of Pi team consists of;
* Mousa Rebouh - Teacher sponsor
* Majid Rebouh - Team leader, coder, and 3d printer
* Rubin Li - Team leader, installation specialist
* Jiankeng Li - Graphic designer
* Felix Youwei Zhang - Graphic designer
* Jeffery Guan - student aide
* Larry Diaz - coder, and graphic designer
