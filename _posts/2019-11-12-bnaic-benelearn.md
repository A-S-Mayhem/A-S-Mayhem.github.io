Last week I attended the Benelux Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (BNAIC) for the first time. This year, it was held in Brussels, in my beloved Belgium.

This yearâ€™s edition was framed around AI Synergies: business meets academics. This was very well reflected in the excellent collection of demonstrations, where we learned about self-driving wheelchairs and puzzle-solving technology.

My contribution to this conference was an [extended abstract](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2491/abstract79.pdf) of thi[s yearâ€™s IJCAI publication](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/159), in which we introduced a new propagation algorithm for stochastic constraints, implemented in the OscaR solver.

My presentation was scheduled in the very first session on the very first day. I was afraid that nobody would turn up, but luckily roughly forty people did. True, a lot of them were my amazing colleagues from the AIA group at UC Louvain, and a few of my (former) colleagues from LIACS in Leiden, but there were also a lot of very unfamiliar faces there.

Then, in [my presentation](http://www.annalatour.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/09.00-Latour-StochasticConstraintPropagationForMiningProbabilisticNetwork.pdf), I used the example of a viral marketing campaign for chocolate, by means of â€˜seedingâ€™ certain people in a social network by giving them a free sample of the chocolate, and relying on them to promote the product to other people through word-of-mouth.

As a reward for the people who showed up at this early hour, I handed out Belgian chocolates to my audience. I hope they appreciated the joke ðŸ™‚
