Goodbye chair and desk. Start of workspace renovation.

My work and research space is located in the advanced telecommunications laboratory, located on the fourth floor of the Civil Electrical Engineering building, of the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, of the University of Chile.

The beginning of chaos
======

This is a space shared between 3 main researchers who work in the areas of telecommunications and signal processing. In particular, I work as a doctoral researcher at the [Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems IDS](http://ingenieria.uchile.cl/investigacion/presentacion/laboratorios/departamento-de-ingenieria-electrica/90774/laboratorio-de-informacion-y-decision)

The researchers in charge of the laboratory decided that the space was disorganized and underutilized. In a quest to increase the number of jobs for researchers they agreed to a restructuring of the space.

The good old way
------
So far, the space has been distributed in some jobs in the peripheral area and a large round table in the center where we enjoyed conversations and meals.

The void
------
It has finally begun, our old desks and chairs are gone, never to return.

We are a little helpless but we keep working during the transition.

The new stuff
------
New desks and chairs begin to arrive.

The new order
------

The new structure begins to take shape, it is time for the fight.

You have to define the distribution of the work desks!

First-in, First-served. Go for FIFS strategy!

The final detail is some green space dividers. Now the desks look like kindergarten tables.
