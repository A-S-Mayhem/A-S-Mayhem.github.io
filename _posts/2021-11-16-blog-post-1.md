This evening, I shared my undergraduate experience, post-graduate experience, and how I became a PhD student at UCI at [the Cognitive Science Association Graduate Student Spotlight](https://campusgroups.uci.edu/cogsciassociation/rsvp_boot?id=1382259) event. This is my first in-person talk since the pandemic. I am so happy that I could talk about my unique graduate school journey to cognitive sciences undergraduates at UCI.
