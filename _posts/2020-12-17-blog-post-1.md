## What is Offline reinforcement learning algorithms
    1. Reinforcement learning algorithms that utilize previously collected data, **without additional online data collection**.
    2. The training process does not interact with MDP at all, and the policy is only deployed after being trained. 

## Why uses Offline reinforcement learning algorithms   
    1. The process of reinforcement learning involves iteratively collecting experience by interacting with the environment, typically with the latest learned policy, and then using that experience to improve the policy. 
In many settings, this sort of online interaction is impractical, either because data collection is expensive (e.g., in robotics, educational agents, or healthcare) and dangerous (e.g., in autonomous driving, or healthcare).
