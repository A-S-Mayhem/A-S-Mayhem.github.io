Hi! Damian here. Welcome to my new website. I built it in an afternoon using the [`Minimal Mistakes`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) template for Jekyll.

I confess that I was trying to use (and even forked) the [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template. Still, I was seduced by the original, plus I believe that the Academic Pages one is not being maintained.

Please feel free to navigate and do contact me if you have any questions about my current projects or if you would like to collaborate on something related.

Sincerely,

Damian
