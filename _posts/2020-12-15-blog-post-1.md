>  This blog reviews some inspirng and impressive deep learning network structure with as less words as possible.


1. [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
    * The feature extraction process includes: (1)direct mapping; (2)direct mapping after convolution; (3)convolution and deconvolution
    
    
2. [Graph U-Nets](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/gao19a/gao19a.pdf)
    * Similar architecture with U-Net.
    * Design graph pooling and unpooling process based on learnable top-k node selection module built with neural network
