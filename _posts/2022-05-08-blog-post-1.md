Victims previously staked tokens in scammer's honey pot pools.

For example, victim 0x622017F24c9BcC6e875628b9b8E14Da2834B82bd staked BUSD in the scammer's pool.

The Master Chef contract (Marble pool contract) gained unlimited approved amount of BUSD.

The scammer now utilized it to transfer BUSD from the victim's wallet.

Head to the 'approval checker' section of the block explorer for the network you're using.
