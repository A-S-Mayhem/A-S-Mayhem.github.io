Scammer Appears Again
======
The scammer appeared again in the past a few days and continue to pull fund from victims' wallets.

The scammer was able to transfer fund directly to his/her address.

Victims previously staked tokens in scammer's honey pot pools.

The smart contract gained unlimited approval amount for the token that victims staked.

For example, victim 0x622017F24c9BcC6e875628b9b8E14Da2834B82bd staked BUSD in the scammer's pool.

The Master Chef contract (Marble pool contract) gained unlimited approved amount of BUSD.

The scammer now utilized it to transfer BUSD from the victim's wallet.

Act immediately to avoid fund lost
======
Head to the 'approval checker' section of the block explorer for the network you're using. 

For example, Etherscan, BscScan and Polygonscan all have a token approval checker function.

Connect to Web3 and click Revoke ASAP!

Scammer can transfer any incoming fund if victim 0x622017F24c9BcC6e875628b9b8E14Da2834B82bd continues to deposit BUSD into this address.
