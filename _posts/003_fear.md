# Making progress even with all the fears
## Possibilities and Fear
Endless possiblities. This is exactly we lose our sense of decision-making. Dealing with uncertainty and the following anxiety.

Fear. It's probably one of the biggest motivators of human. Fear of losing, death and being left lonely. Fear of getting fired, ending a relationship and failing certain goals. Fear of not making it perfect enough, not achieving what one set out to do and regret. Herein lies one of the greatest engine of humanity: imagining the future according to one's world model and feeling the consequences in advance. This is probably also the reason anxiety and fear is deeply seated near the prefrontal cortex.
Well, how do we overcome it? 

## How I try to manage to shape my brain the way I want it.
The answer is quite simple: we develop a plan/solution to get around the anticipated problems and act on it. But this raises another question: what if there isn't a plan or the plan that I've come up with doesn't seem to be a good one and doesn't seem to get me there in the time boundary? When we encouter walls that seem insurmountable, our first response to it is to run away from it or resort to something greater than our being to counter the wall. Worse, we just choose to surrender and inflict self-harm. This is also the point where we reinforce the vicious cycle of depression. 
On top of that we are flooded with distractions. Anxiety and fear makes us much more vulnerable to these easier, cheaper dopamine to erase that overwhelming feeling from memory. It fogs our memeory, our clear view of the situation and thus our decision-making system as a whole.

How do we get away from it?

## Habit, habit, habit
Obviously, habit really guides us of how to get out of these vicious cycle. The secret formula boils down to habit.

Walking the fine-line between self satisfaction and self reflection while constantly building my own definition of success.
