First of all, thank you for reaching to my page and reading these lines. I am sure you will find this site interesting.

It's been such a long time since I wanted to create a blog where writing my thoughts and things related to technology, but the little time
hasn't allowed me to create one and maintain it. The moment has come and I hope to dedicate the time that it requires. I begin with
enthusiasm and I expect that it doesn't disappear.

If you want to know more from me, you can go to [about](https://cris21395.github.io/about) and read the sections that I have written. On 
the contrary, if you want to get in touch with me, go to [contact](https://cris21395.github.io/contact) and send me a message. I will reply 
as soon as possible.
