One can locally or globally optimize LDPC edge distribution. This post briefly discuss how to locally optimize edge distribution following [Richardson's work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/910578), this 

Notations
======
We want to optimize variable node edge distribution $$\lambda(x)=\sum_{i=2}^{d_v}\lambda_i x^{i-1}$$ and check node edge distribution $$\rho(x)$$ such that *threhold* is maximized under specific channels. 

> **Threshold is defined as the supremum of all channel parameters for which the probability of error under density evolution (DE)converges to zero**. In optimization, we set a finite maximum iteration $$m$$ and a target error probability $$\epsilon$$, therefore the threshold computed is a *lower bound* of true threshold.

As pointed out in the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/910578), the implementation of DE inevitably involves quantization. This makes quantization error which accumlates in each iteration and fianlly makes the computation invalid. However, 

> By carefully performing the quantization, one can ensure that the quantized density evolution corresponds to the **exact density evolution of a quantized message passing algorithm**. 


Hill-Climbing Approach
