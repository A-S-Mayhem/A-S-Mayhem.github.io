I have curated and am beginning to read NeurIPS '20 [papers](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/AcceptedPapersInitial) related to privacy.  The list will be constantly updated with the paper summaries. Stay tuned!  
*Note that I wrote a simple script to scrape the ArXiv links to the paper and the links may not be accurate.*
