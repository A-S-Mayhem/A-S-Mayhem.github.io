[Boost](https://www.boost.org/) is an advanced C++ library containing useful applications. This blog will teach you how to install and setup boost step by step on Ubuntu. 

Install and setup Boost
---
First, download [bz2 version boost](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_73_0.html) to the folder you want you install.

Then open a terminal and go to the directory where you download boost, uncopress the file:

```
tar --bzip2 -xf /your/path/boost_1_73_0.tar.bz2
```

Next, go to extracted directory and run `./bootstrap.sh`, I set `prefix=/usr/local`, which need administrator permission: 

```
sudo ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local --with-toolset=gcc
```

Then, run:
```
./b2 toolset=gcc
```
and 
```
./b2 install
```

Finally you need to restart your computer and then you can enjoy boost libraries ! When you compile your code, don't forget to include the path of boost:

```
c++ -I path/to/boost_1_73_0 your_code.cpp -o target
```
