Today, I present my latest research at [Spatial Cognition conference](https://sc2020.lu.lv/). My work compares head direction signals in the human brain during the stationary phase and the translational phase. I'm glad to learn about a mix of interesting studies on spatial cognition conducted by researchers from diversified backgrounds in the past few days of the conference.
