The Xenophobia trend against AAPI communities draws a lot of attention after the mass shooting in Atalanta, including 6 women of Asians. I was monitoring and detecting tweets related to stigmatize the coronavirus using racial slurs such as China Virus, Wuhan Virus, Chinese Virus, Kung Flu, etc. Here is the plot that documents the time series of tweets mentioning these racial slurs in 2020. You see that it has a huge spike after Trump tweeted ChinaVirus on March 16, 2020.
