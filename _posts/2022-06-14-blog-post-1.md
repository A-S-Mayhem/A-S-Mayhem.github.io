Today I gave a poster presentation at the [2022 Interdisciplinary Navigation Symposium (iNAV)](https://inavsymposium.com/program/#tab-id-2) on my recent project "A recurrent neural network model of travel direction in humans". It's great to share my research at the iNAV community again after two years.
