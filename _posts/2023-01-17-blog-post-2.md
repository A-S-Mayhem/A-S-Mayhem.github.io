Technical
------
***Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data*** by Charles Wheelan


Self-help
------
***When Breath Becomes Air*** by Paul Kalanithi (Author), Abraham Verghese (Foreword)

***The Psychology of Money*** by Morgan Housel

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">Some people are born into families that encourage educations; others are against it. some are born into flourishing economies encouraging of entrepreneurship; others are born into war and destitution. I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself. </p>

***The Subtle Art Of Not Giving a Fck*** by Mark Manson

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">What determines your success isn't, "What do you want to enjoy?" The relevant question is, "What pain do you want to sustain?" The path to happiness is a path full of shitheaps and shame.</p>

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">See: it's a never-ending upward spiral. And if you think at any point you're allowed to stop climbing, I'm afraid you're missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.</p>


***You Are a Badass at Making Money: Master the Mindset of Wealth*** by Jen Sincero

***The Fine Art of Small Talk*** by Debra Fine

To be continued as time goes on...
