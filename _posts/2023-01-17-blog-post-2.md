***The Psychology of Money*** by Morgan Housel

<p style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:1em;padding-left:30px;">Some people are born into families that encourage educations; others are against it. some are born into flourishing economies encouraging of entrepreneurship; others are born into war and destitution. I want you to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself. </p>


***You Are a Badass at Making Money: Master the Mindset of Wealth*** by Jen Sincero

***The Fine Art of Small Talk*** by Debra Fine
