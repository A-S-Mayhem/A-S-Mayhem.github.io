The Beginning
======

So good they can't ignore you
------

Great things have passed through september. I did start my graduate studies at Penn. I encountered dozens of people across CIS, grad community, Penn Blockchain, Korean Grad community, Wharton people, etc. 

Craftsmanship
------



Goals of 2022
------
- Get internship offers from 2 of FAANG
  - LeetCode 200 in Python and C++
- Get internship offers from 2 of top-tier Quant Trading Firms(TS, JS, HRT, Citadel, Arrowstreet, DEShaw, Five Rings)
  - Create and test Backtesting strategies, Master the Macro Market View
- 1st in CIS519, 5th in CIS556, A in CIS545

If any of these fails to be achieve, your three months and the money spent were just in vain. Think about how you planned and achieved your goals back in 2015 Fall(already 7 years ago!).
