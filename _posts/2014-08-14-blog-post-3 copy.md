The Brain Food Society is creating a series of displays in our school! We use TVs, Raspberry Pis, and 3D printing to bring these displays to life. Our goal is to address the lack of informational displays in our school and foster a sense of school culture.

These displays will showcase relevant achievements and events to inspire pride and connection within the school community.

Key highlights include:
 Outstanding students
 Outstanding athletes
 School sports events
 Clubs and organizations

We have partnered with the SF Ed Fund, which has been instrumental in supporting our project with funding.

The Bal's Slice of Pi team consists of:
 Mousa Rebouh: Teacher sponsor
 Majid Rebouh: Team leader, coder, and 3D printing specialist
 Rubin Li: Team leader, installation specialist
 Jiankeng Li: Graphic designer
 Felix Youwei Zhang: Graphic designer
 Jeffery Guan: Student aide
 Larry Diaz: Coder and graphic designer
