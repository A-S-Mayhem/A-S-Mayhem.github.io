I'm reading *Legislation and Regulation*, a law textbook about, among other
things, how judges interpret written law (statutes). I've been surprised by (1)
how many important cases hinge on the reading of a single word in the text of a
law, (2) how devoted the Supreme Court is to trying to understand that single
word, and (3) how funny they can be about it.

Here's an example. *Smith v. United States* was a Supreme Court case in 1993.
The facts of the case are this: A certain John Angus Smith traveled from
Tennessee to Florida to buy cocaine, planning to return to Tenneesee and
re-sell at a profit. While in Florida, Smith made an offer to someone who was,
unbeknowst to him, an undercover cop. The offer was that Smith would trade his
MAC-10 submachine gun for two ounces of cocaine.

By the time this case reached the Supreme Court, it was already decided that
Smith was guilty of drug trafficking. The question was whether he would get
extra time, potentially another 30 years, because he, in the words of the
relevant law, "during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug
trafficking[,] use[d] or carrie[d] a firearm." Did Smith's offer to trade a gun
for drugs mean that he "used a firearm" in relation to a drug trafficking
crime? Smith argued that, because he did not fire the gun or threaten anyone
with it, and the phrase "use a firearm" in the law means "use a firearm *as a
weapon*", so that he shold not be subject to the extra jail time.

The Court's majority decided that, yes, trading a gun for drugs qualified as
"using" a firearm, arguing that, while this use of a firearm is not the first
thing that comes to mind when someone says "use a firearm", it nevertheless is
a "use" of a firearm. As an analogy, they say, consider a cane. If you ask, "Do
you use a cane?" the first thing that comes to mind is to use it as an aid to
walking. But, the Court argues, this does not mean that having a decorative
cane in your hallway is not a "use" of a cane. They then point out that the
most famous use of a cane in American history is when Senator Preston Brooks
nearly killed Senator Charles Sumner on the floor of the Senate chamber by
beating him with his cane in 1856. They then observe that using a cane as an
instrument of punishment was once so common that "to cane" meant "to beat with
a cane".

If this diversion into the history of the cane was not amusing enough, the
Court then observes that there are indeed "uses" of a firearm that would *not*
be covered by the text of the law. For example, if a drug trafficker used a gun
to scratch his head, this would not constitute a "use" of a firearm in terms of
the law because, although scratching one's head is certainly a "use" of a
firearm, it does not count "unless [the gun] facilitates or furthers the drug
crime". Indeed: "that the firearm served to relieve an itch is not enough..."
The Court then considers whether, in their reading, pistol-whipping, an
offensive use of a firearm that does not involve firing it, would qualify as
"use" under the law.

The dissenting Justices start by noting that "use" is such an "elastic" verb
that it could be employed in so many ways, noting that "use" in "he uses
tobacco" and "he used to smoke tobacco" mean different things. Then then
address the questions of the decorative cane and the head scratching:

> When someone asks, "do you use a cane?," he is not inquiring whether you have
> your grandfather's silver-handled walking cane on display in the hall; he
> wants to know whether you walk with a cane. Similarly, to speak of "using a
> firearm" is to speak of using it for its distinctive purpose, *i.e.*, as a
> weapon. [...] It would also be reasonable and normal to say that [someone]
> "used" [a MAC-10] to scratch his head. When one wishes to describe the action
> of employing the instrument of a firearm for such unusual purposes, "use" is
> assuredly the verb one could select. [...] It is unquestionably not
> reasonable and normal, I think, to say simply "do not use firearms" when on
> means to prohibit selling or scratching with them...

In a footnote, the dissent writes that it is clear that the ordinary use of
"use a firearm" does not include selling it because a witness who "sold his
grandfather's Enfield rifle to a collector" would be justified in answering
"no" if asked in court whether he had "ever 'used a firearm'".

The dissent also observes that:

> [T]he status provides that its prohibition on certain transactions in
> firearms "shall not apply to the loan or rental of a firearm to any person
> for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes," I have no doubt that the
> "use" referred to is *only* use as a sporting *weapon*, and not the use of
> pawning the firearm to pay for a ski trip.

It's interesting to me that, while I'm sure the Court was not intending to be
funny *per se*, that humor arises from the particular examples that they found
and used to explore the boundaries of the term "use".
