A how-to set-up guide for using C++ with Python with Pybind11.

Instructions are based on [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/working-with-c-cpp-python-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019#create-the-core-c-projects) guide with some of the kinks worked out for common problems.

I am using conda + pip to manage dependencies and using the MS Visual Studio 2019 IDE for C++. 

### 1) Set-Up

- Create project environment, I will be using conda but other environment managers are available. Go to a command line and enter the following:
  ```
   conda create -n venv
   conda activate venv
   conda install pip
   pip install pybind11
  ```
- Configure MS Visual Studio C++ settings
  - Create new C++ project called "superfastcode"
  - Configure project properties, go to ribbon, `Project > superfastcode Properties`

|                         | Project Defaults > Configuration Type    | Dynamic Library (.dll)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| C/C++ > General         | Additional Include Directories           | Add the Python include folder as appropriate for your installation, for example C:\Users\james\Miniconda3\envs\venv\include.                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Linker > General        | Additional Library Directories           | Add the Python libs folder containing .lib files as appropriate for your installation, for example, C:\Users\james\Miniconda3\venv\pycpp\libs. (Be sure to point to the libs folder that contains .lib files, and not the Lib folder that contains .py files.)                                               |

### 2) Write some code
- Within MS Visual Studio, add a .cpp file called "module.cpp". To do this, go to Solution Explorer, Source Files, then select 'add' and choose the .cpp file
- Copy the following code
  ```
  #include <Windows.h>
  #include <cmath>
  #include <pybind11/pybind11.h>

  const double e = 2.7182818284590452353602874713527;

  double sinh_impl(double x) {
      return (1 - pow(e, (-2 * x))) / (2 * pow(e, -x));
  }

  double cosh_impl(double x) {
      return (1 + pow(e, (-2 * x))) / (2 * pow(e, -x));
  }

  double tanh_impl(double x) {
      return sinh_impl(x) / cosh_impl(x);
  }

  namespace py = pybind11;

  PYBIND11_MODULE(superfastcode, m) {
      m.def("fast_tanh2", &tanh_impl, R"pbdoc(
          Compute a hyperbolic tangent of a single argument expressed in radians.
      )pbdoc");

  #ifdef VERSION_INFO
      m.attr("__version__") = VERSION_INFO;
  #else
      m.attr("__version__") = "dev";
  #endif
  }
  ```
  
### 3) Allow access to your C++ code from Python
- Create a setup.py file to expose function to Python
  - Add a .cpp file as above to the Source Files, but rename it to `setup.py`
  - Copy the following
  ```
    import os, sys

    from distutils.core import setup, Extension
    from distutils import sysconfig

    cpp_args = ['-std=c++11', '-stdlib=libc++', '-mmacosx-version-min=10.7']

    sfc_module = Extension(
        'superfastcode', sources=['module.cpp'],
        include_dirs=['pybind11/include'],
        language='c++',
        extra_compile_args=cpp_args,
        )

    setup(
        name='superfastcode',
        version='1.0',
        description='Python package with superfastcode C++ extension (PyBind11)',
        ext_modules=[sfc_module],
    )
  ```
- Back to the commandline with environment venv activated, install the C++ module using pip
  - Navigate to the directory containing 'setup.py' on the terminal
  - Enter the following in ther terminal: `pip install . `
- Check it works
  - Again on the command line, go to a python interpretter for the venv environment
  ```
     python 
     >> from superfastcode import fast_tanh2
  ```


## Common Issues
- 32 bit vs 64 bit
  - Errors such as "fatal error LNK1112: module machine type 'x64' conflicts with target machine type 'X86'" are due to some bit configuratio mis-match
  - Ensure that the bit version of Python and hence pybind11 installed matches the C++ bit chosen. At time of writing I installed Python 3.8 64 bit by default so chose x64 in the MS Visual Studio Configuaration Manager.
  - Some more debugging issues [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3563756/fatal-error-lnk1112-module-machine-type-x64-conflicts-with-target-machine-typ)
- Cannot find pybind11.h
  - Ensure the Python "include" directory, which includes "pybind11.h", is entered in the "Additional include directories" in the Project Properties setup as detailed above. Also ensure that project is being built using the configuration such as Platform x64 corresponding to the project properties with the correct include directories
