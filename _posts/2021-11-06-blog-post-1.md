At this morning's [Psychonomics](https://www.psychonomic.org/general/custom.asp?page=2021annualmeeting) annual conference, I shared with other cognitive psychologists my latest research on how demographic information relates to self-reported navigation skills by conducting data mining on the [Sea Hero Quest](https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/research/for-researchers/resources-and-information/sea-hero-quest/) navigation game dataset from over 900,000 users. It is so fun to see that our environment influences our spatial cognition!
