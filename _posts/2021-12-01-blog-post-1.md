Today is [Neuromatch Conference 4.0](https://conference.neuromatch.io/), I presented my flash talk on sex differences in human head direction signals at the conference. This is my first time sharing my work at a pure computational neuroscience conference and I'm so excited to chat about conference talks with my UCI colleagues at the local meetup! If you are interested in my work, please check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgzp-sRqbmQ&t=12s).
