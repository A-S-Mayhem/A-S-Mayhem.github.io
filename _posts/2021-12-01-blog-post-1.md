Today is [Neuromatch Conference 4.0](https://conference.neuromatch.io/), I presented my flash talk on sex differences in human head direction signals at the conference. This is my first time sharing my work at a pure computational neuroscience conference and I'm so excited about the local meetup at UCI! If you are interested in my work, please check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgzp-sRqbmQ&t=12s).
