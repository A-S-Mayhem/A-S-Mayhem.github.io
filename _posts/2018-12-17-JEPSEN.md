[Jepsen](https://jepsen.io/) is an open source Clojure library for testing distributed databases and systems, 
developed and maintained by [Kyle Kingsbury](https://aphyr.com/) since 2013. 
Jepsen has been extensively endorsed by vendors to test well-established softwares, where it has successfully uncovered many critical issues, 
such as previously unknown bugs in [etcd](https://aphyr.com/posts/316-call-me-maybe-etcd-and-consul), 
[Kafka](https://aphyr.com/posts/293-call-me-maybe-kafka) and 
[Chronos](https://aphyr.com/posts/326-call-me-maybe-chronos).

In this blog post, I will present my firsthand experience in using Jepsen
as (to be precise, extending it to) a framework for testing high-level
properties of Java database applications. 
A basic understanding of Clojure language and Jepsen's implementation will be
assumed. [Here](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen/tree/master/doc/tutorial) is a tutorial 
to learn how Jepsen tests are structured. 



Importing Java Transactions
------
In addition to test automation and logging infrastructures, Jepsen is equipped with a modular programming framework to 
define replicated data structures and their semantics under read/write operations. 
It comes out of the box with a number of simple object definitions and models (e.g. [last-writer-wins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency)
register) which can be used to test correctness of off-the-shelf database systems in various faulty scenarios 
(e.g. network partitions or node clock skews) that are synthetically conducted by Jepsen throughout each test.

I however wanted to use Jepsen for triggering application-level assertions in custom transactional java 
programs taken from [OLTPBench](https://github.com/oltpbenchmark/oltpbench) and was not
interested in the low-level mechanisms any specific database provides. 
In order to do so, I utilized Clojure's runtime environment's ability to run pre-compiled Java code,
and mapped each database operation to a java function and directed Jepsen to
call them with appropriate input arguments and collect their output. 
For example, the operationMap function defined [here](https://gist.github.com/Kiarahmani/0b0409e66d3cc0d0e89a93450c126eab)
relates each Jepsen-level operation (e.g. `NO-TXN`) to to their desired frequency (e.g. 45/100) and corresponding Java function (e.g. `tpcc.NewOrder/newOrder`).

Additionally, I had to set up paths for these external java functions and any
additional library. For example, checkout out my [project.clj](https://gist.github.com/Kiarahmani/680e58683af6abe0b59771c4b61f32ec) 
file that sets up the java-source-paths to `/home/ubuntu/Jepsen_Java_Tests/src/main/java` which is where I kept my compiled Java programs. 
The gist also depicts how I set the resource-path environment variable to the location of
my desired driver (in this case Cassandra JDBC driver). 
I learned how to do this from [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2404426/leiningen-how-to-add-dependencies-for-local-jars/14070422#14070422) after hours of struggling.








Generating Input Arguments
------
I manually extracted necessary functions from OLTPBench source code which generate the
input arguments to each function call, either based on the user-specified distribution or some
real-world data. 
My [tpcc-utils.clj](https://gist.github.com/Kiarahmani/0b0409e66d3cc0d0e89a93450c126eab) file also defines how 
arguments are generated in getNextArgs function, using these extracted
java functions. The extracted java functions can be found [here](https://github.com/Kiarahmani/Jepsen_Java_Tests/blob/makingTPCC/src/main/java/tpcc/Utils_tpcc.java).







Setting Up the Initial State
------
I instructed Jepsen to automatically set up a configurable number of Cassandra
nodes each at a separate EC2 instance.
I used the example from 
[here](https://github.com/riptano/jepsen/blob/cassandra/cassandra/src/cassandra/core.clj) 
to set up nodes automatically in my [database-setup.clj](https://gist.github.com/Kiarahmani/12745ee073904040d0e36eec2260b254) file.

The [database-setup.clj](https://gist.github.com/Kiarahmani/12745ee073904040d0e36eec2260b254) file basically contains two functions  `prepareKS!` and `prepareDB!`. 
The latter is notably interesting where I 
fire up the cluster and create the tables.
The function also calls Cassandra's 
`sstableloader` function  in order to load a set of user-provided
snapshots for each table which hold the initial state of the database. 


In my case, I used OLTPBench testing tool itself to populate a MySQL server with
desired rows: 
<br/>
`./oltpbenchmark -b tpc-c -c config/tpc-c_config.xml --create=true --load=true`

Next, I dumped all tables into a .csv file:
<br/>
`SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql-files/customer.csv'     FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'     LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' FROM CUSTOMER;`

Next, I loaded each file to Cassandra (this step is required only once):
<br/>
`COPY CUSTOMER(C_ID) from '/root/tpc-c/customer.csv' WITH DELIMITER = ',' AND HEADER = true  AND NULL = 'N';`


Lastly, I created snapshot files from the populated Cassandra node and placed them on the appropriate
path for  Jepsen to find them and load them before each test: 
<br/>
`nodetool snapshot -t SSName KSName`










Custom Correctness Checks
------
I also equipped my testing tool with arbitrary scripts that scan the database
and return either a violation of the correctness criteria or a safety guarantee.
