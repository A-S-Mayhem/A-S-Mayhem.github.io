Just like last year, the [International Workshop on Counting and Sampling](https://mccompetition.org/2021/mcw_program) was held online, in conjunction with the [SAT conference](https://www.iiia.csic.es/sat2021/). Just like last year, I was honoured to be invited to submit an extended abstract to this workshop.

We decided to submit [an update](https://mccompetition.org/assets/files/2021/WCS_2021_abstract_8_cachingSchemes.pdf) of Jeroen’s work on caching for model counters, based on his master thesis work. It was accepted, so last week Jeroen presented our work.

While I was naturally happy to see our work presented, I also very much enjoyed the rest of the program. It has been a while since I’ve seen so many interesting talks in a row. I particularly liked the contributions from [Tuukka Korhonen](https://tuukkakorhonen.com/) and [Lucas Bang](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~bang/).

Jeroen’s slides can be found [here](https://mccompetition.org/assets/files/2021/WCS_2021_slides_8_cachingSchemes.pdf), and a recording of his presentation is also [available online](https://cloudstore.zih.tu-dresden.de/index.php/s/4aRmLwHr5jZrkoi).

Thanks to the organisers! I am looking forward to attending next year’s edition!
