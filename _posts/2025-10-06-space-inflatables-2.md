<!-- ## What are the gaps/limitations today? Can we overcome them?
### 

### BRAINS/ARIA
This program would aim to establish the fundamental
technologies of inflatable tubes while enhancing our knowledge on the dynamics
of their stability during/after inflation. To fit within the budget of an
ARPA program, these would likely be systems with minimal control systems for
position and orientation. However, the focus would be on using/developing smarter 
and safer inflatable textiles. -->

## A DARPA-style program for inflatalbe space structures?
### BRAINS
My program's goal aims to achieve technologies for larger orbiting structures for
habs, fabs, and labs. Two solutions for achieving larger structures are via
robots that modularly assemble larger structures; and inflatable/deployable
structures. A third solution would be a combination of the two. Having previously
analysed in-space assembly robotics, my current revised thesis is that
inflatable structures would be a better solution here as they could be cheaper. 
Thus, my  program would focus on developing inflatable tubes that would be
versatile enough  to eventually become rotating wheel space stations.

### ARIA
My program would develop a space superstructure that increases crew and
science capacity of the International Space Station by 10x-100x. This
will be achieved by increasing the usable/occupiable volume that
currently is in orbit. A constraint on my program is that this capacity
should be realised with a single launch of SpaceX’s Starship rocket. My
current thesis for achieving this is by developing inflatable “bicycle”
tubes from stronger materials/textiles integrated with flexible optical
sensors. In space, this system inflates from a packed state in a rocket
into an inflatable “bicycle tube” resembling Wernher von Braun’s wheel
space station. Our monolithic station challenges von Braun’s Lego-style
modular assembly using robots (noting we don’t have autonomous in-space
construction robots yet!). Inflatables also differ from today’s approaches
using astronauts for in-space assembled modular stations. Also, modular
assembly requires multiple rocket launches which is wasteful, slow, and
hurts the environment. A successful program could make monolithic
inflatable tubes THE platform technology enabling scalable in-space
manufacturing with increased usable volumes at reduced cost per cubic
meter. America’s Varda is maturing in-space pharmaceuticals manufacturing
and UK’s BioOrbit has a similar thesis. However, they aren’t addressing
manufacturing at scale, which requires large physical volumes that
monolithic inflatable stations would rapidly provide. Purer semiconductors
are also being considered for in-orbit manufacturing. Tubular space
superstructures will offer a bold stride towards 100-person space stations;
this is more than an order of magnitude improvement over the ISS (crew size
and total pressurized volume) that will drive more scientific output from
space station research. If the tubes are imbued with the ability to rotate,
future long-haul crewed flights to Mars would have the artificial gravity
to overcome health-risks to astronauts. Presently, I feel this program
shouldn’t focus on rotational actuators for artificial gravity as in-space
manufacturing in microgravity holds a lot more impact but is likely something
worth exploring as an opportunity space. The emergence of Starship and impending
ISS retirement are the two obvious reasons to work on this now.

But larger stations need novel stronger and smarter materials
to superscale our ability to abundantly manufacture, work, and live in space thus
enabling a wide range of new scientific, commercial, and exploratory activities.
A risk is we can’t engineer materials strong enough to withstand stresses at
station sizes that offer proposed 10x-100x improvements. Also, the lack of a
community working on this is a risk but the grandeur of the vision and my energy
should catalyse the right talent around the proposed programme. Another risk is
potential public scepticism. However, the long-term benefits for human progress
are profound: scaling sustainable space exploration, advancing materials science
with Earth applications, and expanding our capacity for scientific discovery. This
leap in space infrastructure could catalyse breakthroughs in medicine, technology,
and our understanding of the universe, driving human progress on multiple fronts.

# Reasons a DARPA-style inflatalbe space structures program will fail
1. $50 million might be insufficient for this program as space programs are
often over budget. However, the goals could be made more specific to fit
within this budget or develop a more revised budget.
2. I feel that an ARPA-style program would work best as the program would
need to collaborate with
NASA Johnson's and JPL. However, I wonder if such a program would have too 
many moving parts to coordinate as an ARPA-style program as opposed to an
FRO that does in-house technology development.
3. ITAR could be a bottleneck here; I think my experience introducing
some ARIA PDs to JPL and the resulting conversations show that this
could be overcome because the flow of money does change the power
dynamics. a bit (don't quote me on this, please).

## In view of these risks, why is a DARPA-style program the right way to do this?
### Why not do it in academia?
I already work in academia and the idea of building larger orbiting
structures faces moral oppositions as people think it will purely serve
billionaires. This is before we even explore budgets; I don't personally
know of any academic who wins £50 million in R&D funding via grants.

### Why not do it in a space agency?
The small community on inflatable space structures is distributed and
I have already been in conversation with some experts; these "pieces of
the puzzle" are at NASA JSC and JPL. These engineers and researchers
are unlikely to move from their orgs on a risky project via an FRO, despite their enthusiasm for the topic. I know they're enthusiastic because we pitched an
idea to UK's ARIA for an inflatable space robot. To coordinate them, we
need a ARPA-style program or something close to it.
