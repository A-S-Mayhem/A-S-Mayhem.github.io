Depression, Anxiety, Stress, etc.; there are so many of these undesired dominant states
in our life that we want to avoid. I am writing all these states together here, but by
no means, they are all the same. Our aim here is not to be pedantic about differences
among them, so I would be referring to all such states as unpleasant states. An
unpleasant state is any such state that you might be facing currently but doesn’t want
to. I don’t want to use these words as such because they are so depressing in
themselves. Even if someone is not actually facing them and you tell them that they are,
chances are they might. However, in case you are not sure about your state and that
worries you then I recommend to visit a doctor.

I am not an expert in this domain, and so whatever I am writing here may not be a
recognized subjective theory on the topic. It is instead something that I discovered out
of my own experience and lot of thinking about it.

There are three critical questions that I want to answer here. I believe that reading, acknowledging and reflecting on answers to these questions might help your own situation.

- **How it starts?**
- **How to get out?**
- **How not to fall back?**
