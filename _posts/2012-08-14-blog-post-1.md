Reflection on the book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” by Getnet Demil Jenberia

About the Author
======

<div style="text-align: justify;line-height: 2;white-space: pre-line;">
The author of the book, Robert Kiyosaki, is an entrepreneur, educator, and investor. He believes that the world needs more entrepreneurs who will create jobs. In relation to this he has earned an international reputation for straight talk, irreverence, and courage and has become a passionate and outspoken advocate for financial education. Together with his wife he has founded The Rich Dad Company, A Financial Education Company, and the CASHFLOW games. He is gifted in simplifying complex concepts like ideas related to money, investing, finance, and economics. He has shared his personal journey to financial freedom in ways that resonate with audiences of all ages and backgrounds. <br>


Kiyosaki’s book, the book I reviewed now, is the story of his upbringing in Hawaii and his two fathers: one his biological father, what he called ‘poor father’, and the other, the father of his friend, what he called ‘rich father’. He was forced to choose between following in the footsteps of his poor father (a highly educated government worker) or his rich father (an entrepreneur who never graduated high school). Ultimately, he decides to learn from and follow in the footsteps of his rich dad.<be>


<h1>My Reflections</h1>


The book focuses on the education and financial advice Kiyosaki learned from his rich dad. His rich father was able to create a multi-million-dollar empire from virtually nothing, using his financial insight and the power of his imagination. The book has nine chapters with an introduction at the beginning. Each chapter (especially the first six chapters) spans around important lessons on how peoples get rich and successful. Here are some of the important lessons<br>

I learned from the book: -<br>

 The rich don’t work for money, rather they let money work for them.<br>

 Financial literacy is key for success in financial realm and in life in general.<br>

 To be rich one needs to own businesses, rather than work at them.<be>

 To be rich one needs to understand taxes and the power of corporations.<br>

 Contrary to the poor the rich invent money.<br>

 Work to learn rather than work for money<br>

It is interesting that these lessons combine the teachings of Kiyosaki’s rich dad with experiences from Kiyosaki’s own life. They contain recurring themes, such as the importance of improving once own financial IQ and financial literacy, sets of skills that Kiyosaki believes are absent from the formal education system. Of course, it is undeniable that the formal education is more or less void of these important elements of life and living.<br>

Kiyosaki strongly advices us not to work for money rather we have to let money work for us. Despite this fact he argues that the formal school teaches people to work for money. Kiyosaki states “If you want to learn to work for money, then stay in school. That is a great place to learn to do that”. Further- more, Kiyosaki in this book shows how the rich don’t work for money, and how they force money to work for them. To this end he recommends people to learn and develop financial literacy.<br>

While learning financial literacy people understand the similarity and difference between asset and liability. Kiyosaki stresses the importance of being able to differentiate between an asset and a liability. Rich people acquire assets rather than liabilities. Kiyosaki states that to be truly wealthy, our asset column must be robust and able to offset our living expenses. He explains that most people believe a higher income will make them rich, but, a strong asset column will. With no argument I believe and understand that higher incomes often lead to higher expenses, higher taxes, and more debt, more work, more income… Kiyosaki calls this the ‘rat race’. Therefore, it is my conviction too that people should get out of this rat race to be rich and successful.<br>

Kiyosaki teaches the need for minding once own business. Minding once own business is to mean to build and keep once own asset column strong. In this case he has interestingly guided me see the significant distinction between rich and poor people. Rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. The poor and the middle class often buy luxury items such as big houses, diamonds, furs, jewelry, etc because they want to look rich. They look rich, but in reality, they just get deeper in debt on credit. The rich on the other hand built their asset column first. Then, the income generated from the asset column bought their luxuries. The poor and middle class buy luxuries with their own sweat, blood and children’s inheritance, while the rich buy luxuries with their ample profit accumulated in their asset column.<br>

Rich Dad, Poor Dad explores the power of corporations and demonstrates how the rich use corporations to hold their money. Corporations allow for expenses to be paid pre tax, saving the business owner lots of money. Kiyosaki dispels the myth that taxes hurt the rich the most; rather he shows how many rich people avoid taxes and outsmart the system. Taxes actually hit the poor and middle class much harder than it does the rich. To understand this it requires people to develop their financial knowledge or what Kiyosaki termed as financial IQ while learning Accounting, Investing, Marketing and Law.

Kiyosaki also explores the character traits and beliefs that hold people back from becoming rich. He claims these obstacles can be grouped into five different categories: fear, cynicism, laziness, bad habits, and arrogance. The book explores how each one of these factors acts as a deadlock to financial success; and it explains each of these impediments with real-life examples.<br>

Much of the book is devoted to self-reflection. He used to say ‘to change things do not blame others; rather blame yourself’. He discusses at length the ways in which his rich dad and poor dad have influenced him. Although he ultimately chose to imitate his rich dad, he still retains some of the beliefs that his poor father held, such as the importance of social responsibility and empathy for what he terms as the “have-nots.”<br>

Generally, although Robert Kiyosaki was highly concerned with how business is being made, he has strongly questioned the role of the formal school. Of course I believe that our school system with its present crooked contents and methods need to be questioned. Although the contents and methods of the formal school seem to be helpful for the learners to make them fit with the real world, this is not the case. Rather the contents and methods of schools are making the learners conform to the existing tedious and repetitive life of the mass in the real world. I believe that the school is not able to make students capable of overcoming the problems and challenges facing them in the present world of ours. Of course, observing the reality one can assure the fact that the school system now is not able to make students compete with the changes and challenges in the real world, and it is not able to make students live happy and successful life.<br>

If we accept the a fore mentioned fact, then the question to be raised is “what things need to be changed and improved from the existing practices of the formal school?” We have to make schools learn and improve much from the practices and experiences of the rich Dad. Yah! Much has to be improved from the formal school’s practices to make it go along side with the practice of the rich dad.<br>

I believe that the content of the formal school is one area that needs improvement. It seems that we are teaching sets of contents to the students merely for teaching the subjects. That is, say, Mathematics is taught to students only for the sake of teaching Mathematics. So is Chemistry, or Physics, or History, or Language or the like. But schools should not be solely meant for schooling’s sake; rather they have to help students develop important skills of life such as thinking skills, managing skills, relating skills, caring skills, giving skills, work- ing skills, living skills and being skills. To this end the contents of school’s learning and the organization of the contents (in general the curriculum) must be developed in such a way that they have to help learners learn and develop skills like the aforementioned once so that students will become successful in life and living with the knowledge they learned and the skills they developed.<br>

The other important thing that needs to be addressed is the methodology of teaching. To my understanding and conviction the methodology of teaching in the formal school is making students conform to the saying ‘study hard and get good grades so as to get good jobs’. This has merely forced students to memorize facts and principles from books page by page. Now the questions to be raised are<br>

‘does teaching mean talking or a lecture?’ ‘Does learning mean memorizing?’ The answer ultimately is ‘no’. School learning must not be memorizing facts and principles for future life. Rather it should be part and parcel of once own life. Of course, it should be living. It is in this way that the teaching learning practice in school encourages peoples to ‘learn to use their emotions to think, instead of thinking with their emotions’. Certainly it is this form of schooling that encourages learners to start to question the status quo so as not simply to‘conform to the crowd’. It is this way that students start to create money and let money works for them; instead of working for money. It is this way that people create their own business instead of simply looking for jobs.<br>

All in all, Kiyosaki’s core principles and messages that he learned from his rich dad have ignited my insight on money, investment, education, success, satisfaction, etc. Of course, I have started to question the long established status quo that says, ‘go to school, study hard, get good grades and you will get good job that lets you live a happy life’.<br>

I have come to understand that richness is not simply having money; rather it is letting money work for oneself. Certainly, I have come to realize that schools have to change the whole system that they are functioning in. They have to make themselves part and parcel of the life of the students and the society (at large) instead of being islands in the society. They have to improve their contents and methodologies so as to properly function in today’s fast-paced Information Age; in order that they will enable the generation become individually, socially, financially, etc educated and take an active role in their own life and the life of the society.<br>
