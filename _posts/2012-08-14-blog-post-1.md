Determined to change to CiM in master?
------

My undergraduate thesis has passed successfully, but is optics still suitable to me? During the in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the MZI and other components during building the accelerators, I found several problems in practical ML systems 1. the limit of diffusion of infra-red light is too large compared to modern CMOS process(1um ~ 10nm). 2. the strong absorb effects for visible light. 3. enormous power consumption for active components. To be specific, to modulate wavefront in silicon, power-consuming external stimulus is always implemented on electrical-optic material. Things got even worse when performing nonlinear functions required in ML algorithms using this non-linearity. Maybe I should change to CiM in master and think like a circuit design scientist.
