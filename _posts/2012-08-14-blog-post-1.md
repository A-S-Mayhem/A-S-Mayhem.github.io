Maintaining a Webpage can take some time, so I think it is better to get some help from people that already have spent some time on this. 

A good guide can be found [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
And this a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6AJ9qPPoyc) to start easy.

[This repo](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) to fork from is very useful.

The data for the [web page of the author](https://stuartgeiger.com/) is [here](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
