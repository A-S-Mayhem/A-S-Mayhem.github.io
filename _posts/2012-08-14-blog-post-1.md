I've now completed all prerequesites for the CS, DS, and Stats majors here were my thoughts

Overview
------
The prerequsites at Berkeley certainly have a mixed response from students and the three majors for which I have taken the prerequisites for have wildly different systems for their prerequisites. To give proper context I will list them below, however for those of you who have already taken these classes you might as well skip this section.  
### Computer Science
A GPA of 3.3 is require in the three courses below
|Course | Description                                         |
| ------| ----------------------------------------------------|
| CS61A | Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs   |
| CS61B | Data Structures                                     |
| CS70  | Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory         |

This is often a large source of stress to students due to the difficulty of the courses and a multitude of other factors that I will get into within my review of the courses. 
### Data Science 
All prerequiste courses must be completed with a 'C-' or better
|Course | Description                                         |
| ------| ----------------------------------------------------|
| Data 8| Foundations of Data Science   |
| Math 1B | Calculus II                                   |
| Math 54  | Linear Algebra         |
| CS61A | Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs   |
| CS61B | Data Structures                                     |

Note that there are other requirements, such as Calculus I (Math 1A), or alternate course options such as the Math 10 or 16 series for the Calculus requirement, CS88 for the intro CS requirement, and a multitude of alternates for Linear Algebra that I did not include in the above table, because they are both less popular and I did not take them. 
### Statistics 
3.2 Required within Math Prerequisites, C or better in Data 8, and B- or better for Data 140.  
|Course | Description                                         |
| ------| ----------------------------------------------------|
| Data 8| Foundations of Data Science   |
| Math 1B | Calculus II                                   |
| Math 53 | Multivariable Calculus   |
| Math 54  | Linear Algebra         |
| Data 140 | Probability for Data Science                                     |

A similar principle of alternate courses was used as in Data Science.
