## Basic knowledge

1. Generally, bus lines with **more than 5 buses per hour** are regarded as high-frequency bus services.

## Evaluation criteria

1. Transport authorities use **punctuality-based key performance indicators (KPIs)** to evaluate the performance of low-frequency bus services and **regularity-based KPIs** to evaluate the performance of high-frequency services[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21680566.2019.1606743).
