I don't know about you, but when I have free time I often start thinking about things I 
have always wanted to learn on my own that I don't get a chance to work on on a daily 
basis. Being a life-long lover of pure and applied mathematics, it is only natural that 
I fantasize about the areas of this beautiful field that I've yet to dive deeper into. 
These include [Algebraic Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology#:~:text=Algebraic%20topology%20is%20a%20branch,classify%20up%20to%20homotopy%20equivalence.), [Category Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory), [Number Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), just to name a few. 

While I have always been intrigued by all things analysis (real & complex), one particular sub-branch
has always proven far more captivating: [Functional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis). As a result, I decided to pick up another book in order to close the gaps 
that I had in this area. After reading numerous MathExchange posts about book recommendations,
I landed on [Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Functional-Analysis-Applications-Kreyszig/dp/0471504599) by Erwin Kreyszig. It's truly 
been a fantastic and easy read so far. 

I started working on the problem sets a few months ago, and this is the start of the series 
where I share my solutions to the problem sets belore concluding with my overall review of the 
book. So, grab a copy of the book and a cup of coffee and let's start mathing. 

$\textbf{Note}$: I highly encourage feedback on my solutions. So, if you find any potential mistakes, please
feel free to comment so we can learn together. Students, please don't cheat your way out of your math
classes by using these solutions--remember, you're only harming yourself. 

$$
\begin{align*}
    d(S_n', S_m') &= \left\| \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i - \sum_{i=1}^{m}x_i\right\| \\
    &= \left\| \sum_{i=m+1}^{n}x_i\right\| \leq \left\| \sum_{i=m+1}^{n}|x_i|\right\| < \epsilon
\end{align*}
