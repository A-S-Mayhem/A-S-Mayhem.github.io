Introduction
------

This blog post is based on a paper and a book published by the Theis lab. I will attempt to condense the information relevant to my project here and maybe someone else will also find this useful.

Background
------

The increasing availability of single-cell data across modalities has motivated the development of novel computational methods to help analysts derive biological insights. Advancements in experimental technology have motivated large-scale innovation in computational methods, leading to more than 1,400 tools currently being available to analyse scRNA-seq data. A more extensive and regularly updated (but not peer-reviewed) Single-Cell Best Practices online book with more than 50 chapters including detailed code examples can be found here (https://www.sc-best-practices.org/spatial/introduction.html).

Transcriptome
------
scRNA-seq measures the abundance of mRNA molecules per cell. Extracted biological tissue samples constitute the input for single-cell experiments. Tissues are digested during single-cell dissociation, followed by single-cell isolation to profile the mRNA per cell separately. Plate-based protocols isolate cells into wells on a plate, whereas droplet-based methods capture cells in microfluidic droplets18. In this article, we focus on droplet-based assays owing to their popularity.

The obtained mRNA sequence reads are mapped to genes and cells of origin in raw data processing pipelines that use either cellular barcodes or unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and a reference genome to produce a count matrix of cells by genes (Fig. 2a). For a detailed comparison of various raw data processing tools, we refer to Lafzi et al.19 and consider count matrices as the starting point for our analysis workflow of unimodal scRNA-seq data.
