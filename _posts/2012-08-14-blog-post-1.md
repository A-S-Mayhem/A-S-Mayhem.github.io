## Literate programming: Write replicable papers using the R package "Knitr"

In this section I will describe *my* take on literate programming: not the best, not the only one. Just the one I use.

* Text processor and necessary dependencies: First you will need a software to handle code and syntax highlighting. I use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). Have Sublime Text 3 [installed](http://www.sublimetext.com/3).

    Of course you can just use **R-Studio** to compile all these, of course, under the **knitr** mode: `Preferences -> Sweave -> Weave Rnw files using -> knitr`.

* Inside Sublime Text:
    * Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).
    * `shift+cmd+p`, then **Install Packages**, and install:
        * [R-Box](https://github.com/randy3k/R-Box).
        * [Sublime Knitr](https://github.com/andrewheiss/SublimeKnitr).
        * [SendREPL](https://github.com/randy3k/SendREPL)
        * [LaTexing](http://www.latexing.com/installation.html) or [LaTeX Tools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools).


    * In **R** you have to install **knitr**:

```r
install.packages(c("knitr"), repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
```

* Modify **user** settings in LaTeXing. First line adds *knitr* capabilities, while the second line allows *BibTeX* compilation.

```tex
{"knitr": true,
"quick_build": [
    {
        "name": "Primary Quick Build: latexmk",
        "primary": true,
        "cmds": ["latexmk"]
    }
                ]
}
```

* Writing **R** and **LaTeX** code together:

Create a `.rnw` file. Here is a small example I modified from [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/002-minimal.Rnw), the developer of **knitr**.

Example: Lets try an example. See the output below.

Here is a code chunk.

```r
<<label, fig.cap='Your Title Goes Here', tidy=TRUE>>=
# Speaking of reproducibility, don't forget to set a seed so others can generate the SAME sequence!
set.seed(602)
library(MASS) # to generate multi-var distribution
e <-  as.numeric(mvrnorm(n = 100, mu = 0, Sigma = 1))
plot(e)
@
```

<img src="/resources/label-1.png" alt="Example Plot 1" style="width:400px;height:400px;">

The function `tidy=TRUE` keeps your code within the page margins. See how the line *Speaking of reproducibility...* behaves.

You can also write inline expressions, e.g. \\( \pi \\) = **3.141592**. Here I printed the number \\( \pi \\) by calling the `\Sexpr{pi}` function.

Also, you can use information specified in your code such as the mean of \\( \epsilon \\) which is **-0.1682144**, which I computed calling the `mean` function inside the `Sexpr` expression, like so `\Sexpr{mean(e)}`.

Editors and (**most**) readers are **not** interested in your coding. That's fine. The important thing is to make your code available to the audience that needs it. You can hide it by calling the `echo = FALSE` function in the preamble, i.e. within the `<<>>=` symbols. Below, you will only see the plot, not the coding that generated it.

```r
<<histogram, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Your Title Goes Here'>>=
hist(e)
@
```
<img src="/resources/histogram-1.png" alt="Example Plot 2" style="width:400px;height:400px;">

Finally, following the standard  **LaTeX** tools, you can call the first figure using the `\autoref{fig:label}` function. Similarly, you can call the second one by typing the `\autoref{fig:histogram}` function.

Here below is the LaTeX code. Copy and paste it into a `.rnw` file.

```tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref} % to generate figure and (sub)section hyperlinks within document.
\begin{document}

Here is a code chunk.

<<label, fig.cap='Your Title Goes Here', tidy=TRUE>>=
# Speaking of reproducibility, don't forget to set a seed so others can generate the SAME sequence!
set.seed(602)
library(MASS) # to generate multi-var distribution
e <-  as.numeric(mvrnorm(n = 100, mu = 0, Sigma = 1))
plot(e)
@

The function \texttt{tidy=TRUE} keeps your code within the page margins. See how the line \emph{Speaking of reproducibility...} behaves.

You can also write inline expressions, e.g. $\pi=\Sexpr{pi}$. Here I printed the number $\pi$ by calling the \texttt{Sexpr} function.

Also, you can use information specified in your code such as the mean of {\bf e} which is {\bf -0.1682144}, which I computed calling the \texttt{mean} function inside the \texttt{Sexpr} expression.

Editors and ({\bf most}) readers are {\bf not} interested in your coding. That's fine. The important thing is to make your code available to the audience that needs it. You can hide it by calling the \texttt{echo = FALSE} function in the preamble, i.e. within the \texttt{<<>>=} symbols. Below, you will only see the plot, not the coding that generated it.

<<histogram, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Your Title Goes Here'>>=
hist(e)
@

Finally, following the standard  \LaTeX tools, you can call the first figure using the \autoref{fig:label} function. Similarly, you can call the second one by typing the \texttt{\autoref{fig:histogram}} function.

\end{document}
```
