My wife and I were married in an Orthodox ceremony in Thessaloniki, Greece this
past summer. Many of our guests were not Orthodox, so we wanted to give them
some context about the 30 minutes of ceremony in an unfamiliar liturgical
language that we asked them to sit for.

We couldn't find examples of such a pamphlet, even though we heard from other
couples in similar situations that they wanted something like it and had been
at ceremonies that had something like it. We made our own, and guests raved
about it. I'm posting it here so other people can make use of it!

Most of the information here was drawn from a booklet my wife and I got as part
of a Boston Orthodox Metropolis [marriage prep
seminar](http://boston.goarch.org/ministries/marriage_preparation_seminars.html),
which was surprisingly enjoyable.

In its current form, which dates to the 16th century, the Greek Orthodox
marriage is actually two services put together: a betrothal service and a
crowning service. Unlike a Western wedding, there is no wedding party, only a
"sponsor" (for a woman: κουμπάρα, koumbára), a member of the Church who
sponsors the couple and is a vital player in the wedding’s most symbolic acts.
There are also no spoken vows: the couple’s silent participation in the
betrothal service is the sign of their commitment.

**Betrothal Service: Doxology, petitions, and prayers**

After asking God for the salvation of all souls, peace for the whole world, and
praying for the ceremony attendees and the Archbishop, the priest says: "For
the servants of God, [bride and groom], who are now being joined to one another
in the community of Marriage, and for their salvation; let us pray to the Lord.
That there may be sent upon them peaceful and perfect love, and protection, let
us pray to the Lord."

**Betrothal Service: Exchange of Rings**

The priest announces, "The servant of God [groom] is betrothed to the servant of
God [bride], in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." This
announcement is made three times ---once each for the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit--- once each for the bride and for the groom. The priest places the rings
on the bride and groom, and the sponsor exchanges them.

In the Orthodox church, the primary purpose of marriage is a mutual struggle
toward sanctification. The exchange of rings symbolizes this mutual
self-offering of husband and wife.

**Crowning service: Psalms, doxology, petitions, prayers**

During this section, the priest gives the wedding candles to the couple. The
light symbolizes the divine light that came into the world through Jesus. The
couple holds the candles in their right hands as a reminder that Christ sits at
the right hand of God the Father.

Near the end of this section, the priest prays, "O Sovereign Lord, stretch
forth Your hand from Your holy dwelling place, and join together this Your
servant [groom] and Your servant [bride]." He prays, "Unite them, O Lord, to have
oneness of mind," again emphasizing the Church’s view of marriage as a journey
toward mutual fullness and perfection.

**Crowning service: The crowning**

The priest blesses the crowns (στέφανα, stéfana) and places them on the couple,
announcing three times each for the bride and groom, "The servant of God [groom]
is crowned to the servant of God [bride], in the name of the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit". He reads from Psalm 8: "You [God] have made humankind a little
lower than the angels, and have crowned them with glory and honour." The
sponsor then exchanges the crowns three times.

The crowns are a sign of victory, a reward for the couple's choice to give up
their own desires and to lovingly serve one another. The crowning is the
"moment" the couple is married, analogous to the "I pronounce you" moment in
typical Western ceremonies. To wish someone a happy wedding, Greeks say "Good
crowning!" (Καλή στέψη!, kalí stépsi)

**Crowning service: Scripture readings and petitions**

The readings include Ephesians 5, which includes the verse "Submit yourselves
one to another in the fear of God," another reminder of the mutual sacrifice of
marriage.

**Crowning service: The common cup**

The priest blesses a cup of wine, and the couple drink from the cup, three
times each. The shared wine symbolizes both the sweet and the bitter moments
that the couple will experience together in the journey of marriage.

**Crowning service: Procession, or "Dance of Isaiah"**

The priest leads the couple around the altar three times, symbolizing the
beginning of the marriage journey, which includes the couple as well as the
larger community. The chant in this section begins with the words: "O Isaiah,
dance your joy, for the Virgin was indeed with child; and brought to birth a
Son, that Emmanuel..."

**Crowning service: Final exhortation**

In this final section, the priest speaks directly to the couple, congratulating
them on their marriage and reminding them to emulate Old Testament figures who
were happily married. The crowns are removed, and the couple and the guests are
dismissed.
