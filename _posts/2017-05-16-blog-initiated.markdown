<p> I am -finally!- launching a blog to share personal ideas and thoughts on
research problems, reviews on interesting papers and worth sharing
lessons that I am learning as a computer science PhD student, focusing on programming
languages.
</p>
<p>
Someday -when this blog becomes super popular with hundreds of passionate readers- I will extend the topics and start writing posts
on music too.
