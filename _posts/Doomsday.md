This method was devised by John Conway in 1973 ([his paper starts on page 28](https://www.archim.org.uk/eureka/archive/Eureka-36.pdf)), and it’s a pretty handy little trick once you get the hang of it.
I’ll first cover the various methods and then how it works.[^1]

I’ll be using DD/MM/YYYY.

I’ll be using DD/MM/YYYY.

2/2, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12 all fall on the same day. (Pretty nifty already! )
So does 5/9, 7/11, 9/5, 11/7 , 3/1 (4/1 for a leap lear) and the last day of February. An easy way to remember this is the mnemonic- ‘‘I work 9 to 5 in a 7-11.’’ The only month left out is March, for whom the matching date happens to be pi-day (14/3).

We can call this shared day to be the doomsday. So to determine the day of a date, all we need to do is determine the doomsday of that year, then choose the closest date that matches up to it and count up or down to the desired date.2

[^1]: For lack of time, I’ll add this in at a later date.
