{% epigraph 'A *metascience entrepreneur* is a person, especially an outsider, who aims to make a scalable improvement in the social processes of science.' 'Nielsen and Qiu' ' "A Vision of Metascience" ' %}

The need for a cultural reset in *how science develops* {% sidenote 'sn1' 'One could call this "social processes
of science" (introduced by Nielsen and Qiu), which is a catchall when talking about all the underlying enabling
processes of science such as peer review, funding, hiring, and so on.' %} becomes apparent the longer one
operates within it. A regular observation yet (my biased opinion is that) few actively work on making this
reset happen from within {% sidenote 'sn2' '*within*, indicates that there is considerably more happening
*without*.'%} the systems where the culture reset must happen (i.e., universities, funding bodies, etc.).
This is, perhaps, unsurprising because an individual within such large organisations must overcome both
individual and institutional inertia.
