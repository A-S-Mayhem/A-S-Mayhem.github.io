Sites that inspire me.

Blog Appreciation
======

Now that my site is complete, I have a new appreciation for good webpage. It takes a lot to pull everything together. Itâ€™s okay to start off with a template. Just wanted to give a quick shout out to pages I used as references on how to layout my content and where I draw my inspiration from.

More Thoughts
------
Growing up a millenial, I spend a good deal of time online. Ever since I've began designing this site I have come to realize a few things. 
1. Given the number of websites in the entire web, I only visit a few handful consistently
2. The ones I do visit consistently,their web design is always simple and intuative
3. Perhaps the fashion and style blogs I used to love reading as a young teen require more thought and planning than what meets the eye

What I am getting at is lifestyle and fashion blogs are truly complex. Not only must the author be able to connect effectively with their audience, but also create a space where they can showcase their creativity. Finding thhe balance between information packed content yet simple design can be a challenge. Good website design is imperative to achieving such an equilibrium, and can truly be seen in the websites that have risen to the top of the most visited charts. There is a lot to be learned from these amazing examples.

*Maybe all this theorizing just allows me to justify spending more time consuming all my favorite blogs ;)*
