I graduated from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in April, 2021.

The global pandemic of COVID-19 continued in 2021. I booked my flight back to China in March immediately after I made my final decision for grad school, and arrived in Shanghai on April 11th, China Eastern time. After two weeks of qurantine, I spent another one week in Shanghai, doing all of the end-up work for this final semester. These included two final exams (STATS511 and MATH 525) and a final problem set for MATH 547. 

I didn't synchronously participate in the online ceremony of our department because my boyfriend and I were went to Disney that day to avoid the upcoming travel peak of International Labor Day. 



Here are the screen shots from both the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLUoONLfzd8&t=13s) and the [pdf](https://lsa.umich.edu/content/dam/stats-assets/statsdocuments/Undergraduate%20Reception%20Program_pages.pdf) file. I took them in case that the links expire in the future.
