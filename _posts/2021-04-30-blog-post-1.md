From Sep 2016 to April 2021, I've spent a total of five years for undergraduate education. 

There are so many changes I've experienced in these five years that some old memories would occur to me more like dreams. <br>
My first two years studying Biosciences at Huazhong University of Technology and Sciences was a beginning of my interest in natural sciences, and the three years at UM helped me have a clearer idea of what exactly I want to spend my life to pursue for science. The entire process, which I have to admit, is extremly stressful -- there were so many transitions to deal with that I can only say that I took my first real break (without worries and burdons) along these years after I got my first PhD offer. 


2020 is a terribel year in my life, and the global pandemic of COVID-19 continued in 2021. I booked my flight back to China in March immediately after I made my final decision for grad school, and arrived in Shanghai around 5 am, April 11th, China Eastern time. After two weeks of qurantine, I spent another one week in Shanghai, doing all of the end-up work for this final semester. These included two final exams (STATS511 and MATH 525) and a final problem set for MATH 547. 

I didn't synchronously participate in the online ceremony of our department because my boyfriend and I were went to Disney that day to avoid the upcoming travel peak of International Labor Day.

So, I took some screenshots from both the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLUoONLfzd8&t=13s) and the [pdf](https://lsa.umich.edu/content/dam/stats-assets/statsdocuments/Undergraduate%20Reception%20Program_pages.pdf) file, in case that the links expire some day and I'll lose these memorial moments.
