I am glad that my co-authored book chapter "Central Coordination and Integration of Diverse Information to Form a Single Map" with [Dr. Elizabeth R. Chrastil](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/) was finally accepted by the edited volume on *Collective Spatial Cognition: A Research Agenda* with Routledge (Taylor and Francis). We are currently under the final round of minor revision.
