After writing my first [post](/posts/2018/11/2d-errors/). I was recommended Stan to fit more complicated models to data with X and Y uncertainties. Stan and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is naturally suited to problems like this as the simplest way to treat X errors is to sample over the true x values and then marginalise. This adds a dimension for each data point which breaks most samplers, except HMC. This example is for a simple problem like in the first post, but instead using Stan to sample.
