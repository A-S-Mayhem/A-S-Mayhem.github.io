> In this blog I want to record some notes in traffic control with reinforcement learning, and think about why do we need RL in this domain.

1. RL agents can not only quickly respond to actual conditions found in the field, but also learn to take efficient actions from the experienced traffic behavior. Therefore, the resulting operation can be flexible, cycle-free, and decentralized, offering good scalability and lower vulnerability.
