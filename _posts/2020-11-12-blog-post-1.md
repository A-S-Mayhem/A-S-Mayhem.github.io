> This blog collects what researchers are looking for when they apply reinforcement learning in traffic control .

1. RL agents can not only quickly respond to actual conditions found in the field, but also learn to take efficient actions from the experienced traffic behavior. Therefore, the resulting operation can be flexible, cycle-free, and decentralized, offering good scalability and lower vulnerability. [R](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338911)
2. Reinforcement learning is a suitable technique to solve the traffic signal control problem, as it elegantly represents the elements of the problem - agent (traffic signal controller), environment (state of traffic) and actions (traffic signals). [R](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01142.pdf) 
3. Traffic signals based on reinforcement learning are able to learn and flexibly react to different traffic situations without the need of a predefined model of the environment (i.e., Reinforcement learning does not need initial knowledge of the environment).[R](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=zh-CN&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Developing+adaptive+traffic+signal+control+by+actor+%E2%80%93+critic+and+direct+exploration+methods&btnG=)
4. Different from conventional approaches, RL methods avoid making strong assumptions and directly learn good strategies from the dynamic environment in a trial-and-error manner. [R](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3357384.3357902)
5. Deep reinforcement learning **automatically** extracts all features (machine-crafted features) useful for adaptive traffic signal control from raw real-time traffic data and learns the optimal traffic signal control policy. [R](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02755.pdf%0Ahttp://arxiv.org/abs/)
6. Unlike traditional model-driven approaches, RL does not rely on heuristic assumptions and equations (i.e., prescribe some rules to find solution). [R](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8667868)
7. In traditional transportation research, the model is static; in reinforcement learning, the model is dynamically learned through trial-and-error in the real environment. [R](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08117.pdf)
