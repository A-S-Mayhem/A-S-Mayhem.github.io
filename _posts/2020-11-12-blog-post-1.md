> This blog collects what researchers are looking for when they apply reinforcement learning in traffic control.


### Summary:

From the review on what researchers consider RL in transportation domain, I would have a summary as follows:

1. **Dynamic**: RL model evolves as the interaction with the environment continues. Each decision will in turn help RL model grow stronger.
2. **Flexible**: RL can be applied without complicated prior knowledge of the environment, instead we only need to focus on the definition of basic RL elements. Such feature will be more valuable in traffic control since the traffic dynamic is hard to reproduce.
3. **Robust**: Without too much assumption on the environment, RL can explore optimal policy given less informative knowledge. In addition, RL with deep neural network has larger capacity to endure noise from the environment.
4. **Efficient**: On the one hand, RL with deep neural network can explore optimal policy from raw observation without feature engineering. On the other hand, the trained model can response to the environment quickly.
