> This blog collects what researchers are looking for when they apply reinforcement learning in traffic control .

1. RL agents can not only quickly respond to actual conditions found in the field, but also learn to take efficient actions from the experienced traffic behavior. Therefore, the resulting operation can be flexible, cycle-free, and decentralized, offering good scalability and lower vulnerability. [R](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338911)
2. Reinforcement learning is a suitable technique to solve the traffic signal control problem, as it elegantly represents the elements of the problem - agent (traffic signal controller), environment (state of traffic) and actions (traffic signals). [R](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01142.pdf) 
3. Traffic signals based on reinforcement learning are able to learn and flexibly react to different traffic situations without the need of a predefined model of the environment (i.e., Reinforcement learning does not need initial knowledge of the environment).[R](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=zh-CN&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Developing+adaptive+traffic+signal+control+by+actor+%E2%80%93+critic+and+direct+exploration+methods&btnG=)
