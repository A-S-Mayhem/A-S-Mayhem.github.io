Here are some personal tips for using ROS. After I realized I kept googling the same basic information. 

### 1. Clone existing package from GitHub or somewhere 
   * Create and build a workspace 
     ```
     $ mkdir -p ~/xxx_ws/src
     $ cd ~/xxx_ws/
     $ catkin_make
     ```
   * Clone package 
     ```
     $ cd ~/xxx_ws/src
     $ git clone https://xxxxxx.git
     $ cd ~/xxx_ws/
     $ catkin_make
     ```
Keep in mind that your workspace has a tree like this:   
```
/home
  /usr
    /xxx_ws
      /build
      /devel
      /src
         /your_cloned_package
         /your_other_package
```
