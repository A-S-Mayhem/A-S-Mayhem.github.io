excerpt: "I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Cornell University. My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and international relations. It examines how attitudes towards international affairs shape â€“ and are shaped by â€“ processes of political contestation at the domestic level. In my dissertation project, I explore how populist radical right parties can unintentionally drive support for international economic integration among Western European publics when they engage in extremist rhetoric. I use a wide range of methods in my research, including machine learning, quantitative text analysis, survey experiments, elite interviews, and quasi-experimental research designs."
