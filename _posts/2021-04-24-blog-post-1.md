Today, I gave a short talk about my recent research on head direction signals in human navigation at the UCI [Associated Graduate Students (AGS) Virtual Symposium]( https://www.ags.uci.edu/cfp-2021-ags-virtual-symposium/). The questions I received gave me some clues on the knowledge gap between scientists who use fMRI and other biologists about my particular research. And Iâ€™d thus better polish my future talk to fill the gap. In addition, it was also really nice to learn about the research from neighboring departments (psychological science, biomedical engineering, education, etc.).
