> In this blog I want to record some notes in transit control, which are basically grasped from published paper.

## Some common sense

1. Generally, bus lines with **more than 5 buses per hour** are regarded as high-frequency bus services.
2. Transit riders typically **ignore schedules** with headways less than **10–12 min** [R](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261511001676).
3. Due to high demand, most bus services operate at high frequencies, with headways typically within 10 min along major corridors. With such short headway, operators typically provide only rough headway information, e.g. headway: 5–7 min, but not the exact service timetables. 
4. Some studies suggest buses n-1 and n are bunched if their headway is less than 1 min [R](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Data-as-a-resource%3A-real-time-predictive-analytics-Nair-Bouillet/841aac1aab7824f97979e82b3f409b9bd1eecf66?p2df). Some studies prefer 0 min [R](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019126151630892X).
## Some scientific insignts

1. Transport authorities use **punctuality-based key performance indicators (KPIs)** to evaluate the performance of low-frequency bus services and **regularity-based KPIs** to evaluate the performance of high-frequency services [R](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21680566.2019.1606743). For high-frequency lines, the objective of control is to maintain **low headway variability** and **alleviate bus bunching** [R](https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/37878).

2. When bus service circulate on a route, service is best when times between successive bus arrivals (headway) are equal [R](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261511001676).

3. **Non-uniform** arrival patterns can lead to more severe bunching effects over time [R](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X15002144).

4. The average passenger waiting time E(W)  is related to the average headway  E[H]  and variance of headway ​Var(H): [R](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1791-02)

   E(W) = E(H)/2 + Var(H)/[2E(H)]

### Some classic analytical solutions (More than 100 references)

1. [_Dynamic bus holding strategies for schedule reliability: Optimal linear control and performance analysis_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261511001093)
* **Strategy**:
        * Holding based on a “virtual schedule” of predicted arrival times at stops (as opposed to the published schedule which typically shifts times earlier to avoid early departures from stops).
    * **Contribution**: 
        * Integrate forward and backward headway information to improve both headway regularity and schedule adherence
    * **Drawback**:
        * The strategies may lose effectiveness under system disruption (i.e.,  When a bus breaks down or under severe congestion, the target headway and virtual schedule may become obsolete or invalid);    
2. [A headway-based approach to eliminate bus bunching: Systematic analysis and comparisons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261509000484)
* **Strategy**:
        * Holding based on target headway
    * **Contribution**:
        * First gave a mathematical stability analysis of holding problem based on real-time AVL data.
        * Headway-based control can achieve faster speed in comparison to the schedule-based approach;
    
* **Drawback**:
        * It has forward-looking/non-cooperative character. (i.e., Buses are not allowed to slow down in response to events behind.) 

### Some recent control solutions (2015-)       
1. [_An online learning approach to eliminate Bus Bunching in real-time_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494616303118)

    * **Contribution**: 
        *  A probabilistic framework for detecting a bus bunching event at downstream stops is proposed.
        *  Prediction output is used to select and employ corrective actions (holding and stop skipping).
    * **Drawback**:
        * Do not consider cooperative policy.
2. [_Two-way-looking self-equalizing headway control for bus operations_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261516308074#!)
    * **Strategy**:
