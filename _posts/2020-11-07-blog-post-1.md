> In this blog I want to record some notes in transit control, which are basically grasped from published paper.

## Some common sense

1. Generally, bus lines with **more than 5 buses per hour** are regarded as high-frequency bus services.
2. Transit riders typically **ignore schedules** with headways less than **10–12 min** [R](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261511001676).

## Some scientific insignts

1. Transport authorities use **punctuality-based key performance indicators (KPIs)** to evaluate the performance of low-frequency bus services and **regularity-based KPIs** to evaluate the performance of high-frequency services [R](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21680566.2019.1606743). For high-frequency lines, the objective of control is to maintain **low headway variability** and **alleviate bus bunching** [R](https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/37878).

2. When bus service circulate on a route, service is best when times between successive bus arrivals (headway) are equal [R](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261511001676).

3. **Non-uniform** arrival patterns can lead to more severe bunching effects over time [R](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X15002144).

4. The average passenger waiting time E(W)  is related to the average headway  E[H]  and variance of headway ​Var(H): [R](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3141/1791-02)

   E(W) = E(H)/2 + Var(H)/[2E(H)]

    * **Objective**:
        * Minimize the waiting time as the formula of headway. Each bus consider its impact on N downstream stops (i.e., Rolling Horizon);

    * **Strategy**:
        * Hold for target headway
    * **Conclusion**:
        * First gave a mathematical stability analysis of holding problem based on real-time AVL data.
        * Headway-based control can achieve faster speed in comparison to the schedule-based approach;
 
    * **Drawback**:
        * It has forward-looking/non-cooperative character. (i.e., Buses are not allowed to slow down in response to events behind.)
