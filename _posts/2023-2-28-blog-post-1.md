My co-authored new paper regarding MRI analyses was accepted by [PNAS](https://lilianyou.github.io/files/2023_SynthSeg_PNAS_Billot.pdf). The research introduced SynthSeg+, an AI segmentation suite that provides robust analysis on clinical MRI scans. The tool is available on [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/SynthSeg).
