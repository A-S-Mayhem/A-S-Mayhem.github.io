Non-Relational Database Modeling

About Non-Relational (NoSQL) Data
======

"Not only SQL" databases come in many forms. A couple examples of these are MongoDB and Apache Cassandra.

Non-Relational Database Advantages
------

unstructured data: when different data types and formats need to be stored in a field, NoSQL can handle this well.

large data volumes: distributed databases allow for more machines to be added to process big data volumes.

HA (high availability): protected with more than a single point of failure.

high throughput and fast reads: The drawback of ACID transactions is their slow speed when reading and writing data.

Flexible schemas: NoSQL DBs allow engineers to add columns, which don't need data in every row. This saves disk space tremendously.
