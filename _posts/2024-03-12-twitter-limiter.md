I have a bit of a problem scrolling too much of the awesome content on Twitter. There are just too many other people creating cool ideas and software! At first I justified it by the fact that I find academic papers (my feed is curated to mostly academic CS/ML/SE), but now I admit it's too much!
In a bid to waste more time in order to waste less time, I created a [simple script](https://gist.github.com/bstee615/1f4aa8a6d63dc74aff53dac17d287d91) that puts an extra UI onto each post in my Twitter feed:
- For the first five posts, it numbers them to remind me how many I've browsed.
- After that, it blocks them out with a reminder of the limit I set (currently I keep it at five posts).

Here's what the result looks like:

Here's the link to the script: [JavaScript for Twitter Post Limiter Â· GitHub](https://gist.github.com/bstee615/1f4aa8a6d63dc74aff53dac17d287d91).
I currently import it automatically with [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
Plans are to turn it into a FireFox extension (once conference deadline season is over ðŸ™ƒ).
Hope it's useful!
