[Blind Willie Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Willie_Johnson) was
an early 20th century musician, a famous gospel blues singer, and perhaps the
most brilliant slide guitarist after Robert Johnson. He is most famous for his
song [Dark was the night, cold was the
ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNj2BXW852g),
which was one of 27 pieces of music launched into outer space on the [Voyager
Golden Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record).

Johnson also sang [Jesus is coming
soon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mabTNjhdXeU), which interpreted
the [1918 flu pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) as a sign of
the imminent return of the messiah. It also talks about quarantine and the
closing of schools. A selection of lyrics:

> We done told you<br>
> God done warned you<br>
> Jesus is coming soon<br>
> <br>
> In the year of nineteen and eighteen<br>
> God sent a mighty disease<br>
> It killed a many thousand<br>
> On land and on the seas<br>
> <br>
> The doctors they got troubled<br>
> And they didn't know what to do<br>
> They gathered themselves together<br>
> And called it the Spanish-en flu<br>
> <br>
> The nobles said to the people<br>
> You better close your public schools<br>
> To prevent this epidemic<br>
> You better close your churches too<br>

(The characterization of public health authorities as "nobles" is not atypical
of Johnson's style. For example, in his song [When the war was
on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrH7DvZBA6E), he refers to US President
Woodrow Wilson as "sitting on his throne".)
