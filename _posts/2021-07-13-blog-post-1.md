This evening, I hosted the CNLM ambassador's panel [“How Addiction Hijacks the Brain: What Animal Models Can Tell Us About the Neurobiology of Drugs of Abuse”](https://cnlm.uci.edu/event/how-addiction-hijacks-the-brain-what-animal-models-can-tell-us-about-the-neurobiology-of-drugs-of-abuse/). This panel features four UCI addiction experts [Dr. Christie Fowler](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/fowlerlab/director/), [Dr. Ariana Nelson](https://www.ucihealth.org/find-a-doctor/n/ariana-nelson), [Dr. Jessica Childs](https://mwoodlab.bio.uci.edu/lab/), and PhD candidate [Mitchell Farrell](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/mahlerlab/lab/). This is the second panel hosted by [CNLM Adult Outreach Committee](https://cnlm.uci.edu/ambassadors/#:~:text=The%20CNLM%20Ambassador%20Program%2C%20led,through%20outreach%20and%20educational%20activities.) and we have over 60 attendees from the Irvine community. This time, I enjoyed facilitating the panel discussion, learned about neural mechanisms underlying addiction, and got inspired by scientists who are determined to devote their life long career to improving people's mental health.
