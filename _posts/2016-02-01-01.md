Hard moorning. A taxi driver reached my bicycle with his vehicle. a slight flight and a strong hit against the pavement is my memory of the event.


Lost day
======

The event took place with a police station. The taxi driver fled.

Carabineros supported me and took me to the medical service.

Outside of minor wounds and injuries, it looks like I'm fine.

My left hand and wrist were injured but nothing serious. I can still work with my right hand.

Evidences XD
