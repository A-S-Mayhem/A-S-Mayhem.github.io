This week, attended the annual Alzheimerâ€™s Association International Conference (AAIC) by presenting a poster "Predicting Brain Amyloid Status Using the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function" (virtually by me, in person in Armsterdam, NL by my co-author Prof. [Hiroko Dodge](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/210616)). This is my first presentation at Alzheimer's conference and hope it's a good start.
