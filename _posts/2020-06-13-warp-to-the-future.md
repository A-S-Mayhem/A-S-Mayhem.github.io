Great news! Our paper **Warp to the Future: Joint Forecasting of Features and Feature Motion** published at this year's CVPR is now available on [openaccess](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Saric_Warp_to_the_Future_Joint_Forecasting_of_Features_and_Feature_CVPR_2020_paper.html).
I also created a [webpage](https://jsaric.github.io/f2mf), where I hope to put more results soon.
Check it out and feel free to ping me with questions!
