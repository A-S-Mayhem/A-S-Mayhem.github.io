## Background
The idea of becoming a space-faring civilisation has occupied us
from a fictional lens as well as a scientific one for some time now.
Kepler's [Somnium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnium_(novel)){% sidenote
`somnium` "At the time of my writing this post, his sci-fi story was
archived [here](https://frostydrew.org/papers.dc/papers/paper-somnium)"%}
in 1608 and [Edward Everett Hale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Everett_Hale)'s
[Brick Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Moon) [^a]
from 1865 are
fantastical contemplations of space-faring civilisations that brought with 
it more flak than fanfare {% sidenote 'flak' "Kepler's mom was put on

for witchcraft with some connections to Somnium.

An enduring impact on science, engineering, and human civilisation has come from
scientists obsessed with the stars; Kepler's work in astronomy influenced Newton,
for example. The technoscientific community that has emerged from their work
is larger and more diverse in skills, driving astonishing achievements like
the Apollo program and others in the $20^{th}$and $21^{st}$ centuries. Today's
scientists and engineers battle not just the limits imposed by physics but
that of bureaucratic funders seeking short-term justificaations for projects
especially in realsiing sci-fi realities of space travel and habitation
{% sidenote 'inflatables-2' "not so for space data services, as satellites have
been miniaturised, commodified, and productised out of the hands of governments."%}.

From hereon, this post returns to an old idea of space superstructures: von Braun's rotating wheel
space stations- he was inspired by Herman Potočnik's idea of ring-shaped
habitats{% sidenote 'potocnik' "[*The Problem of
Space Travel*](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Problem_of_Space_Travel.html?id=6m0bCwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y)" %}
in GEO over Berlin. with a focus on inflatable
habitats. I will also explore options for realising space superstructures
that can expand our presence in space and then, hopefully more sensibly,
extend our reach. Along the way, readers may find claims as to why supporting
the development of space superstructures in the near-term is a potentially
valuable and socially pertinent one.

## The vision
Simply put, the vision I am putting forward is of a space station with a crew 
capacity of 100 astronauts, so $>10x$ that of the ISS. In my book, this
implies a pressurized volume $>20x$ that of the ISS so that each crew member
has a hypothetical $100m^3$ of volume though this would be lesser in practice
as the habitable portions have been lesser by around 50% as equipment
takes up a fair amount of room, as well. A more concrete breakdown of estimated sizes
is provided below:

|              Parameters                      | ISS    | von Braun              | Hundred person Habitat |

from one single
rocket launch. To date, no space station has offered an order of magnitude
increase on any of its predecessors and there aren't any planned either {%
sidenote 'inflatables-3' "See table [here](https://www.angadhn.com/online_textbooks/UG_final_year_project/#large-space-stations-modular-or-monolithic)"%}. Instead,
the next likely space station is the Lunar Gateway that will operate at an orbit
further to the International Space Station (ISS).

## Why do we want to do this? (Or what does success look like? Or what does
this enable?) Werner von Braun's 1950's vision of rotating wheel
space stations estimated at least 50 people living and working in
such a station. This would be 5x to 7x improvement on the ISS but
a 10x improvement to 100 astronauts does not, to me, seem unrealistic/unreasonable.

## An old but discarded counterintuitive idea: bicycle tubes in space
A counterintuitive insight I've developed in space engineering is that
simpler solutions are often overlooked for things that are the hot
thing that is usually more complex. One example is ignoring inflatables
and going deeper into using robots to realise large space structures.
My insight challenges several deeply ingrained assumptions in our field.
Firstly, there's a widespread belief that inflatable structures are
less safe due to the risk of Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris collisions.
The incorrect analogy of balloon burstings is often mistakenly applied to sophisticated space inflatables; modern designs incorporate multiple layers
of high-strength materials that are remarkably resistant to punctures and
can self-heal. In fact, their flexibility makes them more resilient than
rigid structures. Secondly, prevalence of robotics in automating human
tasks has led to an assumption that the same approach is optimal
everywhere: we see robots building cars and assume they should build
space stations. But space presents unique challenges where simplicity
is paramount. Inflatable structures have minimal mechanical complexity,
reduce failure points, and simplify construction. Moreover, our
terrestrial experience doesn't include living in inflatable habitats,
making it non-obvious as a space solution. We're accustomed to rigid
structures so cannot envision lightweight, expandable living spaces as
a viable alternative. Yet, in the vacuum of space, these structures
provide vast habitable areas with superior radiation shielding and
thermal management. This insight has profound implications for future
space missions. By embracing inflatable technologies, we can
dramatically reduce launch costs, simplify construction processes,
and create larger, more versatile space habitats than ever before.
It's a reminder that in space engineering, sometimes the most effective
solutions are those that challenge our Earth-biased intuitions.

## The switch to rigid structures and, eventually, modular space stations

## When was it a good time to focus on inflatable space structures?


## Why is now a good time to return to inflatable space structures?
- Starship
- impending ISS retirement are the two obvious reasons to work on this now
- BEAM has progressed with the ISS so we might have learned something good here to
use as a base.

### BRAINS
#### It is not a daft idea- just a forgotten one
Based on Goodyear/NASA's work in the 60's, it is unfair to say that nobody has
done this yet. However, the focus has changed to rigid structures, which
have gained more space heritage and thus continue to be the preferred option.
However, I have been in conversation with a small group of inflatable space
habitat researchers at NASA JSC (e.g., Doug Litteken) and we believe the time
is ripe to focus on this technology again. At this moment, Doug would be a
very useful contact as one of the few but leading experts with a similar
belief on inflatables and the expertise to advise me on successfully
delivering my program on inflatable tubes.

#### There are will be users for inflatable space structures!
NASA and ESA are obvious "end-user" candidates in the near term for expanded
R&D in-orbit. Varda would be another as such inflatable modules could host
their drug manufacturing systems, with the beneficiaries being patients on
Earth. Other avenues here are for materials science research and protein crystal
growth (not my domain of expertise at all). If in-space semiconductor
manufacturing becomes a thing, then larger inflatable volumes would be essential
to scale manufacturing. More sci-fi outcomes are at-scale 3-d printed organs that
would benefit those in need of artificial organs. "Sci-fi shit" like space
tourism is the eventual and hopefully inevitable outcome.



## What are the gaps/limitations today? Can we overcome them?
### 

### BRAINS
The use of inflatable tubular space stations was undertaken by Good Year in
1961, making the idea (at least) as old as NASA itself; however, the lack of
soft materials that could handle micrometeoroid collisions led to focus changing
to rigid space stations. In the late 90's, inflatables came back into the picture
via NASA's TransHab but with comparably modest ambitions: smaller cylindrical
volumes instead of tubes. This program would aim to establish the fundamental
technologies of inflatable tubes while enhancing our knowledge on the dynamics
of their stability during/after inflation. To fit within the budget of an
ARPA program, these would likely be systems with minimal control systems for
position and orientation. However, the focus would be on using/developing smarter 
and safer inflatable textiles.

### ARIA

### According to me/my readings?

## Technical benefits in other space systesm with advanced inflatables

## Long-horizon projections: Where would this take us in 20 years? or Where else could inflatable structures beused?

## A DARPA-style program for inflatalbe space structures?
### BRAINS
My program's goal aims to achieve technologies for larger orbiting structures for
habs, fabs, and labs. Two solutions for achieving larger structures are via
robots that modularly assemble larger structures; and inflatable/deployable
structures. A third solution would be a combination of the two. Having previously
analysed in-space assembly robotics, my current revised thesis is that
inflatable structures would be a better solution here as they could be cheaper. 
Thus, my  program would focus on developing inflatable tubes that would be
versatile enough  to eventually become rotating wheel space stations.

### ARIA
My program would develop a space superstructure that increases crew and
science capacity of the International Space Station by 10x-100x. This
will be achieved by increasing the usable/occupiable volume that
currently is in orbit. A constraint on my program is that this capacity
should be realised with a single launch of SpaceX’s Starship rocket. My
current thesis for achieving this is by developing inflatable “bicycle”
tubes from stronger materials/textiles integrated with flexible optical
sensors. In space, this system inflates from a packed state in a rocket
into an inflatable “bicycle tube” resembling Wernher von Braun’s wheel
space station. Our monolithic station challenges von Braun’s Lego-style
modular assembly using robots (noting we don’t have autonomous in-space
construction robots yet!). Inflatables also differ from today’s approaches
using astronauts for in-space assembled modular stations. Also, modular
assembly requires multiple rocket launches which is wasteful, slow, and
hurts the environment. A successful program could make monolithic
inflatable tubes THE platform technology enabling scalable in-space
manufacturing with increased usable volumes at reduced cost per cubic
meter. America’s Varda is maturing in-space pharmaceuticals manufacturing
and UK’s BioOrbit has a similar thesis. However, they aren’t addressing
manufacturing at scale, which requires large physical volumes that
monolithic inflatable stations would rapidly provide. Purer semiconductors
are also being considered for in-orbit manufacturing. Tubular space
superstructures will offer a bold stride towards 100-person space stations;
this is more than an order of magnitude improvement over the ISS (crew size
and total pressurized volume) that will drive more scientific output from
space station research. If the tubes are imbued with the ability to rotate,
future long-haul crewed flights to Mars would have the artificial gravity
to overcome health-risks to astronauts. Presently, I feel this program
shouldn’t focus on rotational actuators for artificial gravity as in-space
manufacturing in microgravity holds a lot more impact but is likely something
worth exploring as an opportunity space. The emergence of Starship and impending
ISS retirement are the two obvious reasons to work on this now. But the idea of
inflating tubes in space isn’t new but as old as NASA; in 1961, Goodyear was
commissioned to develop inflatable tube space stations. The concept was discarded
as soft materials weren’t strong enough to withstand micrometeoroid collisions.
Since then, safer but much smaller inflatable ISS modules have been made from
Vectran/Kevlar. But larger stations need novel stronger and smarter materials
to superscale our ability to abundantly manufacture, work, and live in space thus
enabling a wide range of new scientific, commercial, and exploratory activities.
A risk is we can’t engineer materials strong enough to withstand stresses at
station sizes that offer proposed 10x-100x improvements. Also, the lack of a
community working on this is a risk but the grandeur of the vision and my energy
should catalyse the right talent around the proposed programme. Another risk is
potential public scepticism. However, the long-term benefits for human progress
are profound: scaling sustainable space exploration, advancing materials science
with Earth applications, and expanding our capacity for scientific discovery. This
leap in space infrastructure could catalyse breakthroughs in medicine, technology,
and our understanding of the universe, driving human progress on multiple fronts.

# Reasons a DARPA-style inflatalbe space structures program will fail
1. $50 million might be insufficient for this program as space programs are
often over budget. However, the goals could be made more specific to fit
within this budget or develop a more revised budget.
2. I feel that an ARPA-style program would work best as the program would
need to collaborate with
NASA Johnson's and JPL. However, I wonder if such a program would have too 
many moving parts to coordinate as an ARPA-style program as opposed to an
FRO that does in-house technology development.
3. ITAR could be a bottleneck here; I think my experience introducing
some ARIA PDs to JPL and the resulting conversations show that this
could be overcome because the flow of money does change the power
dynamics. a bit (don't quote me on this, please).

## In view of these risks, why is a DARPA-style program the right way to do this?
### Why not do it in academia?
I already work in academia and the idea of building larger orbiting
structures faces moral oppositions as people think it will purely serve
billionaires. This is before we even explore budgets; I don't personally
know of any academic who wins £50 million in R&D funding via grants.

### Why not do it in a space agency?
The small community on inflatable space structures is distributed and
I have already been in conversation with some experts; these "pieces of
the puzzle" are at NASA JSC and JPL. These engineers and researchers
are unlikely to move from their orgs on a risky project via an FRO, despite their enthusiasm for the topic. I know they're enthusiastic because we pitched an
idea to UK's ARIA for an inflatable space robot. To coordinate them, we
need a ARPA-style program or something close to it.

### Why not do it in a startup?

[^a]: I've only read a summary of Brick Moon, a story of workers building a 200-foot sphere that are accidentally launched into space to become first inhabitants of space. The moon was to serve as a navigational aid for sailors. It also estimates a cost for the construction at ${\$}250k$ using $12$ million bricks.
