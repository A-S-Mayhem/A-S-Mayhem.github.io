I am very proud of my student [Jeroen Rook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroen-rook-5a4a992b), who defended his Master thesis today! The title of his presentation was: *Caching in Model Counters: A Journey through Space and Time*. With a very general audience, Jeroen had his work cut out for him to explain not only his work, but also the basics of propositional model counting.

After his presentation, Jeroen defended his work to me and his other advisers, [Prof. Dr. Holger Hoos](https://ada.liacs.nl/members/#Holger) and [Prof. Dr. Siegfried Nijssen](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~snijssen/). He handled our questions as well as those from the audience quite well, impressing us with his knowledge of the #P complexity class.

A [preliminary version of this work](https://ada.liacs.nl/papers/RooEtAl21.pdf) was accepted at the [Workshop on Counting and Sampling 2021](https://mccompetition.org/2021/mcw_description).
