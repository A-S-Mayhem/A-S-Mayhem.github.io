## A bit of context 

It was nearly a year ago when I decided to learn Dutch or <q>Nederlands</q>, a term<sup>1</sup> Dutch people use to refer to their own language. My efforts to learn Dutch was not concerted at all and I only did it in my spare time and most often whenever I travel to Holland. At the moment I would describe my Dutch efficiency as modest. I can read easier parts of newspaper articles columns, speak at the basic level and write some of weird Dutch words without mistakes. In my opinion, one of the difficulties to learn the language by yourself is to find approporiate learning resources, and in this post I am going to introduce some of resources I have found useful. Hopefully, there will be some Dutch learners and others who find this article interesting and helpful. I divide the list of resources into three categories: beginner, intermediate, and more challenging. 

I should also mention few good online dictionaries you may like to consistently use. Google Translate is an application that I frequently use. It has many downsides particularly when it comes to Dutch expresssions and proverbs and does not offer examples. It can best be used in tandem with either of following freely accessible online dictionaries: 

* [en.bab.la](https://en.bab.la/dictionary/dutch-english/)
* [nl.glosbe](https://nl.glosbe.com/nl/en/)

I also recommend to have [Wolters Woordenboek](https://www.boekwinkeltjes.nl/s/?q=Wolters+Woordenboek+Nederlands-Engels) hard-copy at hand. I like its completeness of entries and relevant examples.  


## For beginners

* **[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/):** Well, you've probably have heard of it already. Dutch lessons are well-prepared and they are great for absolute beginners. Remember that in addition to exercise lessons on your phone app, there are concise grammar tips for every lesson which are accessible via Duolingo website. Here is an exmaple from the first lesson:

* **Donald Duck Junior** is arguably one of the most popular comic strip magazines with comics from Walt Disney characters in Holland and beyond. Check out [Donald Duck Junior website](https://www.donaldduck.nl/donald-duck-junior).  




## Intermediate Stuff

* **De Canon van Nederland**
is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. It was designed to provide an overview of "what everyone ought to know, at the very least, about the history and culture of the Netherlands", as well as providing a framework for the teaching of History in Dutch schools.
Check out the very cool website [entoen.nu](https://www.entoen.nu/) which hosts the canon material for use in schools and in society in general. You can create your own account and customize your learning chronological map according to your taste. 

* **Donald Duck** is a more serious version of Donald Duck Junior and yes it is read avidly by adults as well as young childrend and teenagers. Compared to Donald Duck Junior the stories are way longer and more interesting and range of vocubalaries vastly greater. I like them a lot and I have a stack of them at home.

## More Challenging










--------------------------------------------------------
1. Nether means _situated down or below_ and _lower_, and the word Nederland literally refers to [the Low Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries). For instance, kan je nederlands spreken?.  <q>Koninkrijk der Nederlanden</q> (Kingdom of the Netherlands) is used officially to refer to Dutch Kingdom, and Nederland (singular) is used for the modern nation.
