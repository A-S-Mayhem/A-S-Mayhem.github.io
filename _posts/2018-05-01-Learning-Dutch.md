## A bit of context 

It was nearly a year ago when I decided to learn Dutch or <q>Nederlands</q>, a term<sup>1</sup> Dutch people use to refer to their own language. My efforts to learn Dutch was not concerted at all and I only did it in my spare time and most often whenever I travel to Holland. At the moment I would describe my Dutch efficiency as modest. I can read easier parts of newspaper articles columns, speak at the basic level and write some of weird Dutch words without mistakes. In my opinion, one of the difficulties to learn the language by yourself is to find approporiate learning resources, and in this post I am going to introduce some of resources I have found useful. Hopefully, there will be some Dutch learners and others who find this article interesting and helpful. I divide the list of resources into three categories: beginner, intermediate, and more challenging. 



## For beginners

* Duo lingo 
*




## Intermediate Stuff

* De Canon van Nederland
is a list of fifty topics that aims to provide a chronological summary of Dutch history to be taught in primary schools and the first two years of secondary school in the Netherlands. It was designed to provide an overview of "what everyone ought to know, at the very least, about the history and culture of the Netherlands", as well as providing a framework for the teaching of History in Dutch schools.
Check out the website [entoen.nu](https://www.entoen.nu/) which hosts the canon material for use in schools and in society in general. 



## More Challenging










--------------------------------------------------------
1. Nether means _situated down or below_ and _lower_, and the word Nederland literally refers to [the Low Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries). For instance, kan je nederlands spreken?.  <q>Koninkrijk der Nederlanden</q> (Kingdom of the Netherlands) is used officially to refer to Dutch Kingdom, and Nederland (singular) is used for the modern nation.
