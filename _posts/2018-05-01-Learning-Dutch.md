## Start 

It was nearly a year ago that I decided to learn Dutch or <q>Nederlands</q>, a term<sup>1</sup> Dutch people use to refer to their own language. My efforts to learn Dutch was not concerted at all and I only did it in my spare time and most often whenever I travel to Holland. At the moment I would describe my Dutch efficiency as modest. I can read easier parts of newspaper articles columns, speak at the basic level and write some of weird Dutch words without mistakes. To my opinion, one of the difficulties to learn the language by yourself is to find approporiate learning resources, and in this post I am going to introduce some of resources I find useful. Hopefully, there will be some Dutch learners and others who find this interesting and useful.

1. Nether means _situated down or below_ and _lower_, and the word Nederland literally refers to [the Low Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries). For instance, kan je nederlands spreken?.  <q>Koninkrijk der Nederlanden</q> (Kingdom of the Netherlands) is used officially to refer to Dutch Kingdom, and Nederland (singular) is used for the modern nation.
