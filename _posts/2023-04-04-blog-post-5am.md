## Background
I've heard people talking about highly successful CEOs and managers who wake up extremely early in the morning and even complete their workout routine before 5 am. However, I'm always skeptical about this claim, as I believe that one cannot perform well during the day without getting enough sleep and then not think about this again. 

What inspired me to rethink about the 5 am idea is that this morning I cliked a Youtube video from one of my favorite financial Youtuber "MoneyXYZ", [in his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zXTyc2ZjXM) he shares the story of what inspired him to start the 5 am project and what continues to motivate him to stick with it. 

What struck me was that (1) we should focus on what needs to be done early in the morning instead of getting up early itself, (2) get up early is a game with time. I will address my feeling and needs particularly with the first point. The key here is that instead of doing what those successful people told you what you should do, for example, meditation or work out, you should use the morning time to solve a burning problem for you. For "MoneyXYZ", it was his burning need to learn how to make animate for his youtube videos. 

## 5 AM Plan
For me, I listed my burning needs:
- Finish the discussion section of my deep learing paper and publish it as soon as possible
- Brush my knowledge on the basics of machine learning (statistic, probability, linear algebra, neural nets...). I did not realize how bad I need to get better at elaborating basics until a recent embrassing MLE interview. But, it is never too late to mend!

When I was watching the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zXTyc2ZjXM) this morning, I realized that it is spring break at CMU this coming week, and it seems to be an excellent chance that I plan out and exercise my 5 am plan. So, here is how I am starting my 5 am project.

<!-- ## Reflections
The excitment in my head rought back my memories in my undergrad time. As a undergrad in a regular institution in China, all I wanted at that time was to get out of that situation and study at the US. I got up extremely early and got back to dorm 15 mins before the dorm closed the main gate and continued doing this for almost 2 years. I seemed to lost such passion as -->
