# Linear, Clear Focus

## New start
September was full of great events. I started my graduate studies at Penn. I encountered dozens of people across CIS, Penn Blockchain, HAFS in the east, the Korean Grad community and even some Wharton people.
New start is always gets people full of hope, drawing where they would be in the next year, and so on. Herein lies the trap. Full of possiblities, I often just drown in them, missing out on the opportunity to narrow down my decisions and make those dreams a reality. 

## Facing and acknowledging my weaknesses.
Biggest failure comes from not being able to face reality as it is and coldly evaluating my status in light of  where I need to be. Surely, there is this problem of exploration and exploitation (where it is necessary in many cases to do enough research to make the optimal choices). The problem is these searching keep proliferating across multiple dimensions. Even this month, I started out with a set goal of being a software engineers, but then realized I could also aim for some quant firms. I had to find what they required, what I needed to get prepared. At the same time I couldn't let go of my inherent fascination towards DeFi industry. My reading list just kept getting longer, from Antigragile to Macroeconomics to Habit-related books to market wizards, trading, order-books and so on.
I had to acknowledge that I was not a superman, that I couldn't do all of these at once. I need to make them linear. This is interesting, because ever since high school, I despised the idea of linear thinking. I believed in exponential thinking, chemical reactions between different discipline. 
No. That was exactly what was holding me back. I had to concede that this was what was taking me back. I was losing my capacity to prioritize certain works over others. I was drowning in the false image of "diversity trap" that I had set for myself.d

## So good they can't ignore you. Craftsmanship.
I needed to achieve my interests one by one. Most importantly, I need to be so good that they couldn't ignore me. 
Rather than looking out for some wonders or things the company will give me, I should now orient myself towards more "what can I offer the world" mindset. This required repetitive hard work to achieve the level at which my expertise and knowledge carried a substantial market value. Which lead me to making a "linear" set of goals to achieve.

## Goals of 2022
  1. Get internship offers from 2 of top-tier Quant Trading Firms(TS, JS, HRT, Citadel, Arrowstreet, DEShaw, Five Rings)
  2. Get internship offers from 2 of FAANG
     - LeetCode 200 in Python and C++
  3. Create and test Backtesting strategies, Master the Macro Market View
  4. 1st in CIS519, 5th in CIS556, A in CIS545

## Some messages to myself
If any of the above fails, your three months and money spent would just be in vain. Think about how you planned and achieved your goals back in 2015 Fall. Think about how desperate you were to prove yourself. How angry you were at the world for not letting you in. When you faced your reality and the next steps necessary to amend them one by one.
