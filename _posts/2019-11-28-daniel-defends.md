Yesterday was a very special day: DaniÃ«l Fokkinga, the master student who I have been supervising together with Marie Anastacio, Holger Hoos and Siegfried Nijssen, presented and defended his master thesis!

It is wild to see this happening only a few years after I defended mine. It feels like it was just such a short time ago that I was in his shoes, and yet Iâ€™m at the other side of this interaction now, prepping difficult questions for him to answer.

I was very happy to see that he brought a lot of friends and family, and it was lovely to meet them. Meeting DaniÃ«lâ€™s parents and brother made me feel quite special, because heâ€™s been such an important person in my work life for over a year, working with him on an interesting line of research. It was nice to have someone at the institute to talk to about my own research, and very gratifying to see him do so well at his presentation. It made me feel special that I got to share that with the *actual* important people in his life ðŸ™‚
