This blogpost will examine whether model biases can be mitigated by training a Variational Fair Autoencoder for Heterogeneous Mixed Type Data (VFAE-HM) following the modeling approach of [Louizos, C. et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00830.pdf). Additionally, the approach of [Ma, C. et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11941) is considered for determining proper output distributions for the decoder of the VFAE.
