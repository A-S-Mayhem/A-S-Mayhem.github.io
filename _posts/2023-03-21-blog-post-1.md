Open source software and free software are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. While they share a common goal of promoting access to software, there are fundamental differences between the two.

Free software, as defined by the Free Software Foundation, is software that gives users the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software. In other words, it is software that is free both in price and in the ability to modify it. This philosophy is grounded in the belief that software should be a tool for empowerment and not a means of control.

On the other hand, open source software is defined by the Open Source Initiative as software that allows anyone to see its source code and modify it. The goal of open source is to promote collaboration and transparency in software development. The focus is on the practical benefits of collaboration, rather than on the philosophy of software freedom.

One of the key differences between the two is the licensing terms. Free software licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), require that any modified versions of the software be distributed under the same license. Open source licenses, such as the MIT License or Apache License, are more permissive and allow for more flexibility in how the software is used and distributed.

Another difference is the underlying philosophy behind the two movements. Free software advocates believe that software should be a tool for empowerment and that users should have complete control over the software they use. Open source advocates believe that the best way to create high-quality software is through collaboration and that open source development practices can lead to better software.

In summary, while both open source and free software promote access to software and the ability to modify it, the underlying philosophies and licensing terms differ significantly. Understanding these differences is important when choosing which type of software to use or contribute to.

Overall, the key takeaway is that while open source and free software may seem similar at first glance, they have different values and goals. By understanding these differences, you can make informed decisions about which software to use and contribute to based on your own values and goals.
