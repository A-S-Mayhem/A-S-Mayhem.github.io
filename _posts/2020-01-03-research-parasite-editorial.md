As the 2019 [Research Parasite](http://researchparasite.com/) Junior Parasite award recipient, GigaScience asked me to share some thoughts on life as a research parasite - tips and philosophies on doing open and reproducible science as a PhD student. The [resulting piece](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz148) is now published!

I had a lot of fun combining some of the topics I talked about in my ["PhD Chat" talk](https://cduvallet.github.io/phdchat-philosophies/) at my lab summit, plus some that I mentioned in my [award speech](/posts/2019/12/research-parasite) into this commentary.

Check it out, hope you enjoy it!
