Simulating the Spread of Ideas with Epidemiology (HackNC 2018 Hackathon)

The general goal of this project was to model and simulate the spread of ideas using known epidemiological models, real data, and our own developed models. The simulator takes in some chosen grouping of connected communities (such as related subreddit pages on reddit.com), and uses known coupled differential equations for the spread of infectious diseases to simulate the spread of ideas within these communities. In turn, ideas can spread between said communities using the conditional probabilistic principles of Markov Chains. This project was originally a HackNC 2018 project, that ended up winning the award for Most Innovative Hack. Some links:

Exploring the Quantum Random Walk Search Algorithm (Qiskit 2020 Community Summer Jam)

For IBM’s quantum computing competition, the 2020 Qiskit Community Summer Jam, a few fellow UNC physics majors and I decided to try implementing the well known (discrete) Quantum Random Walk search algorithm, originally theorized by Shenvi et. al, with IBM’s quantum computing API Qiskit, for the purpose of eventually testing it on IBM’s real quantum computers. We created multiple implementations in Qiskit, first as a unitary operator and then decomposed into more compact two-level unitary gates. Finally, going beyond the search algorithm, we map the output of the Quantum Random Walk circuit to a grid, taking inspiration from Cellular Automata. We plan to extend our quantum random walk algorithm code by implementing Google's PageRank algorithm in Qiskit (with an efficient Szegedy quantum walk). Here are some links:
