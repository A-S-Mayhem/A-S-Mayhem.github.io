Music Performance

I play the French horn as a hobby, and played as co-principal horn in the UNC Symphony Orchestra (currently on hold due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic), for all four of my years at UNC Chapel Hill. I also played in the UNC Wind Ensemble as a first year.

Music Composition

I began informally composing and arranging music since about late middle school/early high school, and since taking a music theory course my second year of high school, I began doing it at a more advanced level. I’ve composed a few original pieces for brass quintet, clarinet choir, solo piano, solo organ, and other ensembles/instruments, and I’ve arranged multiple pieces for different ensembles, such as Saturn (from Holst’s symphony The Planets) for concert band. I’m currently working on a brass quintet arrangement of the first half of Stravinsky’s orchestral piece The Rite of Spring.

Exercise and Mindfulness

I’ve lately been into running, yoga, and other pandemic-friendly activities to stay healthy. I also try to be mindful, and practice meditation and mindfulness-related exercises.
