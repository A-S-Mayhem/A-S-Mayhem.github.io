Early Life

I was born to Jeffrey Konz and Louly Peacock in 1998, in Asheville, North Carolina. I went to Asheville Catholic School for two years, then Isaac Dickson Elementary School for four, and I played the violin for a year or two. My sister Flora was born in 2003. I went to Asheville Middle School for two years, where I began playing trumpet for a year, then switched to the french horn, which I still play regularly. I played in the AMS band, and the WNC All-District Band. I also ran cross country in AMS for two years.

High School

I went to Asheville High School for four years, where I mainly focused on academics and music. I was part of organizations such as the Math Honor Society, Science Olympiad, Tri-M Music Honor Society, National Honor Society, and others. I played horn in the AHS marching band (mellophone section leader for the last three years) and wind symphony, the NC All-State Band and WNC All-District Band, and the AHS Brass Quintet. I also played horn in the Asheville Buncombe Youth Orchestra, as well  as a brass quintet for the ABYO. During this time, I also took a basic course on Einstein’s Theory of Relativity at Brown University’s summer program, and I was a camp counselor in training at Camp Henry, a summer camp at Lake Logan (near Canton, NC) that I had been going to for years.

College

I did my undergraduate work at UNC Chapel Hill, with majors in Astrophysics and Mathematics, graduated May 2020 with Highest Distinction. I also presented my senior honors thesis and passed with Highest Honors. I focused mainly on academics, research, and music (I played in the UNC Symphony Orchestra all four years, and I like to compose and arrange music from time to time). During my free time, I like to exercise, work on side projects, hang out with friends, and cook. Please see my CV and my other interests for more info!
