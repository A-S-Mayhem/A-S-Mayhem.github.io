## Abstracts

* Ruobing Zhang
  * This talk focuses on the recent resolution of the following three well-known conjectures in the field.
    * Any volume collapsed limit of unit-diameter K3 metrics is isometrically classified as: the quotient of a flat 3D torus by an involution, a singular special Kähler metric on the topological 2-sphere, or the unit interval.
    * Any complete non-compact hyperkähler 4-manifold with quadratically integrable curvature, must have a classified model end.
    * Any gravitational instanton can be compactified to an open dense subset of a compact algebraic surface.
