## Abstracts

* Ruobing Zhang
  * This talk focuses on the recent resolution of the following three well-known conjectures in the field.
    * Any volume collapsed limit of unit-diameter K3 metrics is isometrically classified as: the quotient of a flat 3D torus by an involution, a singular special Kähler metric on the topological 2-sphere, or the unit interval.
    * Any complete non-compact hyperkähler 4-manifold with quadratically integrable curvature, must have a classified model end.
    * Any gravitational instanton can be compactified to an open dense subset of a compact algebraic surface.

* Kristen Hendricks
  * Abstract: We discuss the history of applying localization results in equivariant Lagrangian Floer homology to Heegaard Floer homology to obtain rank inequalities for various versions of the Heegaard Floer homology of branched double covers. We then use recent refinements on the symplectic side to establish an inequality between the dimensions of the Heegaard Floer homologies of any double cover between three-manifolds branched along a nulhomologous link. We discuss the relationship with the L-space conjecture and (time permitting) mention some other topological applications. This is joint work with R. Lipshitz and T. Lidman.

* Vinicius G. B. Ramos
  * The Toda lattice, billiards and the Viterbo conjecture
Abstract: The Toda lattice is one of the earliest examples of non-linear completely integrable systems. Under a large deformation, the Hamiltonian flow can be seen to converge to a billiard flow in a simplex. In the 1970s, action-angle coordinates were computed for the standard system using a non-canonical transformation and some spectral theory. In this talk, I will explain how to adapt these coordinates to the situation to a large deformation and how this leads to new examples of symplectomorphisms of Lagrangian products with toric domains. In particular, we find a sequence of Lagrangian products whose symplectic systolic ratio is one and we prove that they are symplectomorphic to balls. This is joint work with Y. Ostrover and D. Sepe.

* Daniel Stern
  * I'll discuss recent progress on the existence theory for harmonic maps on higher-dimensional manifolds, giving harmonic maps of optimal regularity from manifolds of dimension n>2 to every non-aspherical closed manifold containing no stable minimal two-spheres. As an application, we'll see that every manifold carries a canonical family of sphere-valued harmonic maps, which (for n<6) stabilize at a solution of a spectral isoperimetric problem generalizing the conformal maximization of Laplace eigenvalues on surfaces. Based on joint work with Mikhail Karpukhin.
