## Abstracts

- Li-Sheng Tseng
  - Often times, manifolds of interests are equipped with a geometrical
    structure specified by a distinguished closed form. Such manifolds
    include special holonomy and symplectic manifolds. In this context, I
    will motivate the usefulness of considering pairs of differential forms
    that are linked together by a map of the distinguished form. We will show
    how this can lead to novel functionals and geometric flows. As an
    application, it leads to new notions of flat connections and Morse theory
    on symplectic manifolds. This talk is based on joint works with Jiawei
    Zhou, David Clausen and Xiang Tang.
