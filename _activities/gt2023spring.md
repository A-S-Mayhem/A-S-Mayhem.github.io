  - Often times, manifolds of interests are equipped with a geometrical
    structure specified by a distinguished closed form. Such manifolds
    include special holonomy and symplectic manifolds. In this context, I
    will motivate the usefulness of considering pairs of differential forms
    that are linked together by a map of the distinguished form. We will show
    how this can lead to novel functionals and geometric flows. As an
    application, it leads to new notions of flat connections and Morse theory
    on symplectic manifolds. This talk is based on joint works with Jiawei
    Zhou, David Clausen and Xiang Tang.

  - For any compact Riemannian manifold $M$ with smooth metric $g$, using eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator, Berard, Besson, and Gallot constructed the heat kernel embedding map $\psi _{t}:x\in M\to \sqrt{2}( 4\pi ) ^{n/4}t^{\frac{n+2}{4}} \\{ e^{-\lambda _{j}t/2}\phi _{j}( x ) \\} _{j\geq 1}\in \mathcal{l}^2$ and showed it is almost isometric as $t$ goes to $0$, which can be regarded as an asymptotically orthogonal relation in the 1-jet space of $\psi _{t}.$ We further study the higher derivatives of $\psi _{t}$ with respect to an orthonormal basis at $x$ on $M$. As $t$ goes to $0$, it turns out the limiting angles between these derivative vectors in $\mathcal{l}^2$ are universal constants independent of $g$, $x$, and the choice of orthonormal basis. Geometric applications to canonical isometric embedding, mean curvature, and the Riemannian curvature will be given. We will also explore some algebraic structures of the $\infty$-jet space of $\psi _{t}$.
