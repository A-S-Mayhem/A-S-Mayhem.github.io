## Abstracts

  - Often times, manifolds of interests are equipped with a geometrical
    structure specified by a distinguished closed form. Such manifolds
    include special holonomy and symplectic manifolds. In this context, I
    will motivate the usefulness of considering pairs of differential forms
    that are linked together by a map of the distinguished form. We will show
    how this can lead to novel functionals and geometric flows. As an
    application, it leads to new notions of flat connections and Morse theory
    on symplectic manifolds. This talk is based on joint works with Jiawei
    Zhou, David Clausen and Xiang Tang.

  - For any compact Riemannian manifold $M$ with smooth metric $g$, using eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator, Berard, Besson, and Gallot constructed the heat kernel embedding map $\psi _{t}:x\in M\to \sqrt{2}( 4\pi ) ^{n/4}t^{\frac{n+2}{4}} \\{ e^{-\lambda _{j}t/2}\phi _{j}( x ) \\} _{j\geq 1}\in \mathcal{l}^2$ and showed it is almost isometric as $t$ goes to $0$, which can be regarded as an asymptotically orthogonal relation in the 1-jet space of $\psi _{t}.$ We further study the higher derivatives of $\psi _{t}$ with respect to an orthonormal basis at $x$ on $M$. As $t$ goes to $0$, it turns out the limiting angles between these derivative vectors in $\mathcal{l}^2$ are universal constants independent of $g$, $x$, and the choice of orthonormal basis. Geometric applications to canonical isometric embedding, mean curvature, and the Riemannian curvature will be given. We will also explore some algebraic structures of the $\infty$-jet space of $\psi _{t}$.

  - We show that for any closed symplectic manifold, the number of fixed points of any non-degenerate Hamiltonian diffeomorphism is bounded from below by a version of integral total Betti number, which takes account of torsions of all characteristics. The proof relies on defining integer-valued counts from moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves, which are only orbispaces in general. This is joint work with Guangbo Xu.

- Chris Wendl
  As every symplectic topologist learns in Kindergarten, the moduli space of J-holomorphic curves is generically smooth only if one restricts to the open subset of simple curves; the multiple covers are a problem, and they cannot in general be perturbed away. This is a fundamental difficulty in every equivariant Fredholm problem, resulting from the essential incompatibility between transversality and symmetry. Sometimes, however, the symmetry is important and you really don't want to perturb it away -- and it turns out that sometimes, it is possible to achieve transversality anyway, or something almost as nice! In this talk I will present a general method for understanding such issues and illustrate it via two popular examples of equivariant Fredholm problems: (1) closed orbits for a 1-parameter family of contact forms or Hamiltonian structures, and (2) unbranched covers of J-holomorphic curves in a symplectic cobordism with only hyperbolic asymptotic orbits.
