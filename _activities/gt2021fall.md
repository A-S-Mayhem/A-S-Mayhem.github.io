## Abstracts
* Russell Avdek
  * Let S be a convex hypersurface with neighborhood N(S) inside of some contact manifold M. When dim(M)=3, Giroux's criterion provides a user-friendly way of determining exactly when N(S) is tight in terms of simple closed curves in S. It appears very difficult to state a generalization to the case dim(M)>3 in terms of topological data. Instead, we'll describe an exact criterion for "algebraic tightness" which is applicable in all dimensions using holomorphic curves. The proof of our result combines obstruction bundle gluing and Kuranishi techniques.
