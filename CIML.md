This [bookdown](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/ml_book/) has been created based on the tutorials of the course **14.388 Inference on Causal and Structural Parameters Using ML and AI** in the Department of Economics at MIT taught by Professor Victor Chernozukhov. All the scripts were in R and we decided to translate them into Python, so students can manage both programing languages. [Jannis Kueck](https://www.kaggle.com/janniskueck/code) and 
[V. Chernozukhov](https://www.kaggle.com/victorchernozhukov/code) have also published the original R Codes in Kaggle. In adition, we included tutorials on Heterogenous Treatment Effects Using Causal Trees and Causal Forest from Susan Athey's Machine Learning and Causal Inference [tutorial](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/3e3ee3cb-b53e-4956-b8d3-a3243e663162/access/1618). We aim to add more empirical examples were the ML and CI tools can be applied using both programming languages.
