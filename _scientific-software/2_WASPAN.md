I am a member of a team dedicated to develop a novel nanocluster database, WASP@N, in which we intend to link a web-interfaced database and compute nodes dedicated to help scientific community to search, discover and disseminate nanoclusters.

<br><br>
The web-interfaced database is designed to:
<ul><li>to enable the users an access to the uploaded nanoclusters (i.e. search, visualise, download),</li>
<li>to calculate physical properties of the uploaded nanoclusters (e.g. symmetry, moments of inertia, electrical dipoles, etc.),</li>
<li>to find similar structures which were previously uploaded (i.e. by analysing the topology of the nanoclusters),</li>
<li>to perform on-demand analysis of nanoclusters (e.g. radial distribution function, angular distribution, etc.),</li>
<li>to perform on-demand calculations,</li>
<li>to provide a platform for the users to upload their own data and share it among the other users.</li></ul>

WASP@N is developed using: Java, C/C++, Fortran, HTML, JavaScript, and Python. The website can be accessed using the following link: <a title="WASP@N website" href="http://hive.chem.ucl.ac.uk" rel="alternate">click here</a>
