Honors Program in Business (Yonsei)

The BBA at Yonsei does not have a Bachelor's paper requirement for graduation, but I regard this final paper as something equivalent.

This work has evolved into a full-blown research paper: _Dividend Taxes, Corporate Choice, and Investment: Evidence from 2015 Tax Cut in South Korea_, for which the advisor for this final paper, Professor <a href="https://ysb.yonsei.ac.kr/faculty.asp?mid=n02&sOpt=A&uid=118" target="_blank">Saeyeul Park</a>, became a co-author.
