# Leveling up with github


- I find that I usually set up a github repository after I've already starting writing some code for a project (or at least already have some documents in a project folder, like data). So I often return to the helpful instructions on how to initialize an existing repository [on the command line](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html) and [on GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/adding-a-repository-from-your-local-computer-to-github-desktop)
- You can set your configuration settings to convert https urls to ssh, allowing for easy and pain-free switching between GitHub Desktop and command-line or CLI github. 
All it takes is one line of code! 
Thanks to [@cmeyerton for sharing the one-liner solution on github forums](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/2085#issuecomment-397016061)
