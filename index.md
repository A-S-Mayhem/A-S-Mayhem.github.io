Need to make a bio here

On this website you can find an overview of my [published research](pages/publications/), [current working papers](pages/workingPapers), and [teaching](pages/teaching). Here are links to my [CV](papers/CV_Hollenbach.pdf), [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1B4nx4oAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/fhollenbach). Recently, I have put together some resources on improving students' academic writing, you can find those under: [http://fhollenbach.org/WritingAcademic/](http://fhollenbach.org/WritingAcademic/).
